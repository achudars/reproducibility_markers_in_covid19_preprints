Nonetheless, there is limited evidence on whether highway concessions and Public Private Partnerships (PPP) can bring road safety benefits, despite the growing number of countries adopting this type of policy to finance and manage road infrastructure. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences approach to examine the causal effect of highway concessions on road safety outcomes using daily data from Brazilian Federal highways over 11 years between 2007-2017. We exploit the transition from public to private management in some but not all Brazilian states to provide both within- and between-states comparison. We find that concessions promote a small but significant reduction in the number and fatality of road crashes as well as and the number of people and vehicles involved in crashes. Between 2007-2017, procured roads had on average 16 fewer deaths then publicly managed highways for every 1000 crashes each year. These road safety benefits only become statistically significant a few years after the concession implementation, but they are marginally larger for every additional year of treatment. Finally, our results suggest that including safety-based incentives in concession contracts can substantially improve road safety performance. The findings of the paper have important implications for the social and economic evaluation of road concessions and for road infrastructure policy more broadly.",TRUE,FALSE,Differences-in-Differences|Road concessions|Road crashes|Road procurement|Road Safety,2020-07-15T19:20:00.926437,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-15T19:19:46.571390,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,Ipea,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/citation/,rqew3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8yhb7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/relationships/node/,8yhb7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0e4860e85f46008490db72/,5f0e4860e85f46008490db72,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqew3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rqew3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rqew3

A functional analysis of Hello Barbie,"The current smart toy research has not fully acknowledged the existing research on traditional toys. Instead, the focus has been on the digital layer of smart toys. This study contributes to bridging the gap between traditional and smart toy research by applying the analytical model known as the functional manipulation potential of toys (FMP) to identify if and how smart features such as connectivity affect otherwise traditional toys. Based on purposeful sampling of informant-rich cases, this study uses FMP to analytically compare the digitally enhanced Hello Barbie doll to a traditional Barbie. The data, analyzed using abductive methods, comprises the tangible dolls and the 8,000 lines of dialogue that Hello Barbie can speak. The results show that connectivity can notably change the FMP of an otherwise traditional toy. These changes took place in two forms: additions and amplifications. Additions mean that Hello Barbie contains functional elements a traditional Barbie does not. Amplifications refer to situations where already existing elements were augmented by the connectivity.

The consequences of working poverty for later-career workers – who should be in their highest-earning ages – are particularly dire. We expect that later-career workers are especially vulnerable in terms of risk and duration of working poverty and that those who have accumulated disadvantages over their life courses, in terms of the intersecting dimensions of race/ethnicity, gender, early-life socioeconomic status, and educational attainment, will suffer disproportionately. We use incidence-based Markov chain multistate models to analyze the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, which is representative of the U.S. population aged 50 and older. We find that Black women and men, Latinx, those who experienced more earlylife disadvantages, and people with lower education have higher risk and longer durations in working poverty over the period 2002-2012. Our findings also suggest that when confronted with economic hardship – the Great Recession – later-career workers who originate in lower socioeconomic statuses, especially Blacks and Latinx, are in more precarious economic positions.

Using 3,720 hot spot-days, we show that the “sweet spot” duration of police absence, to maximize the residual deterrence of crime, was a full four days after the last day of targeting police patrol at each hot spot.  Over a 248-day period, we randomly reshuffled 15 separate hot spots daily into either treatment (targeted police patrols) or control (no targeted patrols) for that day, so that all locations repeatedly switched between randomly assigned groups.  This repeated crossover design (Cochrane &amp; Cox, 1957; Fienberg et al., 1980) included random periods of up to 20 consecutive days in which individual hot spots remained in the control condition, allowing us to measure how soon, and by what trajectory, the residual deterrent effect of targeted patrolling wore off.  After four days without patrolling, there was a sudden termination of residual deterrence, marked by a 66% rise in offense frequency, and a 395% spike in our index of crime harm (House &amp; Neyroud 2018), compared to the treatment condition.

The former corresponds to quantum indeterminism, and the latter, to classical determinism. No other premises (besides the above only mathematical equivalence) are necessary to explain how the probabilistic causation of quantum mechanics refers to the unambiguous determinism of classical physics. The same equivalence underlies the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. It merged the well-ordered components of the vectors of Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics and the non-ordered members of the wave functions of Schrödinger’s undulatory mechanics. The mathematical condition of that merging is just the equivalence of the axiom of choice and the well-ordering theorem implying in turn Max Born’s probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. Particularly, energy conservation is justified differently than classical physics. It is due to the equivalence at issue rather than to the principle of least action. One may involve two forms of energy conservation corresponding whether to the smooth changes of classical physics or to the discrete changes of quantum mechanics. Further both kinds of changes can be equated to each other under the unified energy conservation as well as the conditions for the violation of energy conservation to be investigated therefore directing to a certain generalization of energy conservation.",TRUE,FALSE,|causation|choice and well ordering|determinism|Hilbert space of quantum mechanics|indeterminism|probabilistic causation,2020-07-14T11:07:51.863460,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-14T11:07:08.877048,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfa|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Logic and Foundations of Mathematics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/citation/,yztwv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0d7727e8dcdd0021ef2c99/,5f0d7727e8dcdd0021ef2c99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yztwv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yztwv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yztwv

A Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Custodial Sanctions on Reoffending,"Research Summary: Despite a downsizing of the prison population over the last decade, the United States remains the world’s largest incarcerator. While prior meta-analytic reviews have indicated prisons have a null or slight criminogenic effect, there has been a substantial increase in primary studies assessing the impact of custodial sanctions on reoffending since 2010. The current study conducts the most comprehensive and rigorous meta-analytic review of research to date comparing the effects of custodial and non-custodial sanctions on reoffending. Using a sample of  959 effect sizes calculated from 116 studies, this review builds on prior research by (a) conducting the first inclusive  review of the research in over a decade; (b) drawing on advancements in modeling techniques that could account for the precision and statistical dependence of effect sizes; and (c) examining whether a wide variety of methodological characteristics moderate mean effect sizes. The results of multilevel analyses revealed that custodial sanctions have a weak criminogenic effect on reoffending and that this effect is relatively robust across a wide variety of methodological moderators. 

Policy Implications: America’s reliance on incarceration is unlikely to wane in the near future. However, the results of the current study illustrate that incarceration is not achieving one of its oft-desired goals of deterrence. While there is certainly a subset of high-risk offenders for whom incapacitation is warranted, in general, placing individuals in custodial sanctions appears to contribute to, rather than reduce, reoffending.  As a result, sentencing low-level offenders and marginal felons to non-custodial sanctions may lead to considerable savings for correctional departments and allow offenders to be connected to and contribute to their communities while reducing reoffending. For the sake of public safety and those for whom incarceration is appropriate, however, more research is needed on the in-prison social and psychological dynamics increase post-release criminal behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,Deterrence|Meta-Analysis|Prison|Probation|Recidivism,2020-07-14T05:25:40.747730,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-14T05:25:30.308115,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/citation/,f6uwm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0c992dc91a2000eab17228/,5f0c992dc91a2000eab17228,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6uwm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6uwm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6uwm
