While the reasons for this variation is undeniably complicated, one behavior that continues to have a significant effect on the dynamics of these social movements is the use of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. This paper explores the role that these communication tools played in the 2011 Egyptian revolution where the revolution succeeded in overthrowing the Mubarek regime. Compiled from local social media reports, the data has been analyzed and displays a direct correlation between the use of social media and the organization of mass protest. Furthermore, the dissemination of the local’s emotional responses via social media sites allowed for a stronger personal association from the global community. There is enough evidence to show that social media directly assisted with the organization of protests and demonstrations that helped force leaders to either step down or start reforms. Furthermore, social media spread news about these revolutions across the world, educating and humanizing the activists, which in turn helped secure international support for their cause.",TRUE,FALSE,arab spring|egyptian revolution|mubarek|revolution|social media|social network analysis,2018-07-02T10:48:24.105659,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-10T22:18:35.580000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/citation/,baxvg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mmw83/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/relationships/node/,mmw83,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58c086456c613b021f3d2b88/,58c086456c613b021f3d2b88,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baxvg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/baxvg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/baxvg

Andrew Fear makes an excellent point when he wrote: “The Agricola is a complex text and it would be a mistake to see it dominated by one single narrative purpose” (Fear, 305). Tacitus employs a variety of writing techniques that range from ring composition to homage to sarcasm in order to express his views. In this paper I will be focusing on Tacitus’ biography of his father-in-law, G.

While positive steps have been made, such as the enactment of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990) and the Protocols for Native American Archival Materials (2006), severe limitations exist due to a difference in worldview and cultural beliefs. In order to reverse the effects of hegemony and decolonize archival methodol- ogy, an exerted effort must be made to increase collaboration between archives and Indigenous communities. Furthermore, higher education must attract Indigenous students to information science programs in order to create a more diverse workforce.

We argue that the ways in which these perspectives are rooted in different temporalities and historicisations have resulted in the construction of commonplace and time-worn representations. In practical terms, we take issue with several patterns of narratives that have led to the sensationalism of media industry and the essentialisation of collective memory. Taken together as a common feature of contemporary policy and analysis in the dominant international opinion, politics and scholarship, these narrative patterns show that historical knowledge is conveyed in ways that make present and represent the accounts of another past, and the ways in which beliefs collectively held by actors in international society are constructed as media events and public hegemonic representations.

As many as 20 have been devised since the 1830s (Dalby 1967, 1968, 1969, inter alia) including one created as recently as 2002 (Mbaye 2011). Talented individuals with no formal literacy are likely to have invented at least three of these scripts, suggesting that they had reverse-engineered the ‘idea of writing’ on the same pattern as the Cherokee script, i.e. with minimal external input. Influential scholars like Edward Tylor, A. L. Kroeber and I. J. Gelb were to approach West African scripts as naturalistic experiments in which the variable of explicit literacy instruction was eliminated. Thus, writing systems such as Vai and Bamum were invoked as productive models for theorising the dynamics of cultural evolution (Tylor [1865] 1878, Gelb [1952] 1963), the diffusion of novel technologies (Kroeber 1940), the acquisition of literacy (Forbes 1850, Migeod 1911, Scribner and Cole 1981) the cognitive processing of language (Kroeber 1940, Gelb [1952] 1963), and the evolution of writing itself (Gelb [1952] 1963; Dalby 1967, 2). This paper revisits the three West African scripts that are known to have been devised by non-literates. By comparing the linguistic, semiotic and sociohistorical contexts of each known case I suggest various circumstances that may have favoured their invention, transmission and diffusion. I argue that while the originators of scripts drew inspiration from known systems such as Roman and Arabic, they are likely to have drawn on indigenous pictorial culture and annotation systems to develop their own scripts. Once established, their creations were used to circumscribe an alternative politico-religious discourse in direct opposition to the discourses of colonial administrations. The appeal of these scripts were thus tied more to their relative indexical power than their apparent technological or cognitive advantages.

In doing so, we contribute to the theory of international environmental agreements, which has overwhelmingly assumed that governments make decisions based on a single set of public-interest motivations. Our results suggest that lobbying on emissions may affect the size of the stable coalition in counterintuitive ways. In particular, a powerful business lobby may increase the government's incentives to sign an agreement, by providing it with strong bargaining power with respect to that lobby at the emission stage. This would result in lower total emissions when the number of countries involved is not too large. We also show that things change radically when lobbying bears directly on the membership decisions, suggesting that both the object and timing of lobbying matter for the way in which membership decisions, emissions and welfare are affected.",TRUE,FALSE,Game theory|International Environmental Agreements|lobbying|special-interest groups,2018-07-02T10:45:15.381510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-09T19:48:25.544000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/citation/,46xby,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qvqqq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/relationships/node/,qvqqq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58c1af5eb83f690042a3f119/,58c1af5eb83f690042a3f119,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46xby/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/46xby/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2016.09.009,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/46xby

From the construction of a 185,000 square foot facility in the bottom of a ravine, to the much-discussed art acquisitions and features in national media, this attention is hardly surprising. However, beyond the building and the art, Crystal Bridges also has an art research library with many rare books and the most important collection of American color printed books in North America.
