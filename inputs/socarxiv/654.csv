Qualitative data are commonly collected in higher, graduate, and post-graduate education; however, perhaps especially in the quantitative sciences, utilization of this qualitative data for decision-making can be challenging. A method for the analysis of qualitative data is the Degrees of Freedom Analysis, published in 1975. Given its origins in political science and its application in mainly business contexts, the degrees-of-freedom analysis method (DoFA) is unlikely to be discoverable or used to understand survey or other educational data obtained from teaching, training, or evaluation. This paper therefore introduces and demonstrates the DoFA with modifications specifically to support educational research and decision-making with examples in bioinformatics. DoFA identifies and aligns theoretical or applied principles with qualitative evidence. The demonstrations include two hypothetical examples, and a case study of the role of scaffolding in an independent project (“capstone”) of a graduate course in biostatistics. Included to promote inquiry, inquiry-based learning, and the development of research skills, the capstone is often scaffolded (instructor-supported and therefore, formative), although it is actually intended to be summative. The case analysis addresses the question of whether the scaffolding provided for a capstone assignment affects its utility for formative or summative assessment. The DoFA is also used to evaluate the relative efficacies of other models for scaffolding the capstone project. These examples are intended to both explain this method and to demonstrate how it can be used to make decisions within a curriculum or for bioinformatics training.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:20:44.967254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-03T12:15:24.973653,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/citation/,5acrw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e64jd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/relationships/node/,e64jd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59fc5d73b83f69026e610404/,59fc5d73b83f69026e610404,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acrw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5acrw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5acrw,NA

While the ideal of objectivity is key to American journalism and its development as a profession, recent scholarship and new media developments have challenged the dominance of objectivity as a professional norm. This article begins with the understanding that subjectivity is an intractable part of knowing (and reporting on) the world around us to build our understanding of different modes of subjectivity and how these animate journalistic practices. Taking arts reporting, specifically reviewing, as a case study, the analysis draws on interviews with 40 book reviewers who write for major American newspapers, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and prominent blogs. Findings reveal how emotions, bias, and self-interest are salient – sometimes as vice and sometimes as virtue – across the workflow of critics writing for traditional print outlets and book blogs and that these differences can be conceptualized as different epistemic styles.",TRUE,FALSE,bias|Blogs|books|critics|emotion|epistemology|journalism|newspapers|objectivity|online media|practice|reviews|subjectivity,2018-07-02T11:20:44.900344,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-03T12:10:42.088335,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/citation/,z6fht,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2kzdx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/relationships/node/,2kzdx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59fc5b1c9ad5a102665bd6cc/,59fc5b1c9ad5a102665bd6cc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z6fht/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z6fht,https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884917722453

Findings are the following: (1) The graphs were made in the field of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive medicine by questionable methods, including falsifying, trimming, and misunderstanding of data. (2) Researchers in the field of fertility study relied on secondary and tertiary sources thus ignoring and compounding errors.

Digitization projects, such as the Google books project, are reviving the hope that this dream may come true. Moreover, the ubiquity of the networked environment promises to open access to this über-library to everybody with an internet connection. Today the entire collection of human knowledge may be only one click away. Whether the dream of the Library of Alexandria may be achieved by the Google books project is highly debated. Recently, a court decision concluded that perhaps that dream is not within Google’s reach at the moment. In this paper I will review the Google books project as both an opportunity to discuss the orphan works problem and to examine the copyright strictures impinging on digitization projects. In looking at the Google books litigation, I will investigate the sustainability of Google’s fair use defense before delving into the description of the Google books settlement. I will then discuss the recent opinion from the Court of the Southern District of New York rejecting the settlement in its present form. I will argue that the Google books settlement is an additional move towards propertization and privatization of culture, though admittedly furthering public interest as well. This time, privatization involves memory institutions.

An upcoming revision of the Audio-visual Media Services Directive would ask platforms to put in place measures to protect minors from harmful content and to protect everyone from incitement to hatred. Meanwhile — under the assumption of closing a ‘value gap’ between rightholders and online platforms allegedly exploiting protected content — the Draft Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market would implement filtering obligations for intermediaries. Finally, the EU Digital Single Market Strategy has also endorsed voluntary measures as a privileged tool to curb illicit and infringing activities online. Each of these actions will erode the eCommerce intermediary liability arrangement by bringing in — in a way or another — proactive monitoring obligations and causing a systemic shift from a negligence-based to a strict liability regime for hosting providers. This systemic shift would apparently occur against public consensus and absent any justification based on empirical evidence. Nonetheless, it will bring about dire consequences by pushing privatization of enforcement online through algorithmic intelligence, based on murky, privately-enforced standards, rather than transparent legal obligations.

But we show that rather than religion fading into irrelevance as the secularization thesis would suggest, intense religion—strong affiliation, very frequent practice, literalism, and evangelicalism—is persistent and, in fact, only moderate religion is on the decline in the United States. We also show that in comparable countries intense religion is on the decline or already at very low levels. Therefore, the intensity of American religion is actually becoming more exceptional over time. We conclude that intense religion in the United States is persistent and exceptional in ways that do not fit the secularization thesis.",TRUE,FALSE,Religion|Secularization|Social Change,2018-07-02T11:19:49.333029,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-31T18:54:30.782829,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|Arts and Humanities|Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/citation/,xd37b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f7bps/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/relationships/node/,f7bps,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f8c669594d90026cd810c0/,59f8c669594d90026cd810c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd37b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xd37b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xd37b,NA

of patient–patient social influence on health exists. Previous research found that social
relationships influence cancer patient’s health; however, we have yet to understand social
influence among patients receiving chemotherapy in the hospital. We investigate the influence
of co-presence in a chemotherapy ward. We use data on 4,691 cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom who average 59.8 years of age, and 44% are
Male. We construct a network of patients where edges exist when patients are co-present
in the ward, weighted by both patients’ time in the ward. Social influence is based on total
weighted co-presence with focal patients’ immediate neighbors, considering neighbors’ 5-year
mortality. Generalized estimating equations evaluated the effect of neighbors’ 5-year mortality
on focal patient’s 5-year mortality. Each 1,000-unit increase in weighted co-presence with a
patient who dies within 5 years increases a patient’s mortality odds by 42% (β = 0.357,
CI:0.204,0.510). Each 1,000-unit increase in co-presence with a patient surviving 5 years
reduces a patient’s odds of dying by 30% (β = −0.344, CI:−0.538,0.149). Our results suggest
that social influence occurs in chemotherapy wards, and thus may need to be considered in
chemotherapy delivery.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:19:49.016441,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-31T17:33:20.555146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,US Government,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/citation/,k5tb7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pfndk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/relationships/node/,pfndk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f8b267594d90026cd8062f/,59f8b267594d90026cd8062f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5tb7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k5tb7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k5tb7,https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2017.16
