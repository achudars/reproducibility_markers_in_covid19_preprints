Contemporary discussions and debates on intellectual property (IP), antitrust, and the intersection between them are typically framed in economically oriented terms. This Article, however, shows that there is more law in law than just economics. It demonstrates how the rule of law has influenced the development of several IP doctrines, and the interface between IP and antitrust, in important, albeit not always acknowledged, ways. In particular, it argues that some limitations on IP rights, such as exhaustion and limitations on tying arrangements, are grounded in rule of law principles restricting the arbitrary exercise of legal power, rather than solely in considerations of economic efficiency.
The historical development of IP law has reflected several tensions, both economic and political, that lie at the heart of the constitutional order of the modern state: the tension between the benefits of free competition and the recognition that some restraints on competition may be beneficial and justified; the concern that power, even when conferred in the public interest, can often be abused and arbitrarily applied to advance private interests; and the tension between freedom of contract and property and freedom of trade. This Article explores how rule of law considerations have allowed courts to mediate these tensions, both in their familiar public law aspects but also in their less conspicuous private law dimensions, and how, in particular, they have shaped the development of IP doctrine and its intersection with antitrust law and the common law.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Law|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:04.065133,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-28T16:33:07.247000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/citation/,yqwe9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/82c63/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/relationships/node/,82c63,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/579a33c46c613b01f6ecf573/,579a33c46c613b01f6ecf573,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqwe9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yqwe9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yqwe9

showing the astonishing rate of growth of multi-defendant John Doe
litigation in United States district courts over the past decade. It also
presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation
and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films.
Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become the most common form of
copyright litigation in several U.S. districts, and in districts such as
the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving
pornography accounts for more than half of new cases.

This Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the literature on
copyright trolls. Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars
addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based
definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues
that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe
litigation should be considered copyright trolling whenever it is motivated
by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such
litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the
courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal
activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely
within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing
status-based definitions of copyright trolls do not account for what is now
arguably the most prevalent form of trolling.

shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant

insiders.  Qualitative approaches to understanding library users provide
opportunities, provide space, give chances for breath, reflection,
possibilities, and perhaps most important of all, for persuasion.

separate domains, with the ‘digital’ assumed to be disembodied,
decontextualised and freefloating, and spaces in the material campus
positioned as prototypically ‘traditional’ and analogue. Libraries in
particular are often characterised as symbolic of predigital literacy
practices and forms of meaning making. This binary oversimplifies student
engagement, particularly in relation to their creation of and interactions
with texts. Two studies illustrate this: an investigation of student and
staff textual practices that explored the complex and emergent networks
they created, adapted and maintained; and one that explored perceptions and
use of library spaces (digital and physical). A sociomaterial analysis
shows the ongoing importance of institutional, personal and public spaces.
This demonstrates that in order to enhance the student experience, a more
nuanced understanding of the complex, emergent relationships between
digital and print, device and user, and author and text is required.
