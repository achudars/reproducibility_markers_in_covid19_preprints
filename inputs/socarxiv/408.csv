Teachers provided content online that allowed measuring the students’ engagement, satisfaction, teacher’s role, and content and examination. Using the tools online on Blackboard®, discussion on forums and listening activities, the teacher provided the blended learning activities. The three-step strategy (3SS) framework was adopted for language learning.It provided students strategies that generated, supported and manipulated the blended learning activities for learning in the face to face sessions. The study investigates how blended learning activities motivate the engagement of students, their satisfaction, the role of the teacher, content and assessment from the students’ point of view. The study uses a population of 38 students from two sections of a listening and speaking class (control G1 n = 20 and blended G2 n = 18), a placement test, examination results and responses from a questionnaire as instruments for examining the effect of blended learning activities on the students’ engagement, satisfaction, teacher’s role, content and examination. The results using descriptive statistics demonstrate positive effects of using blended learning activities in supporting the improvement of students’ learning on listening and speaking at elementary level.e. In brief, using the evidence from the study reveals that exposing foundation year students to blended learning activities have positive effects on students’ engagement, satisfaction, teacher’s role, content and examination when learning English.

Informed by conversation analysis (CA) approach, this study aims to identify the opening sequences and ritual expressions of informal mobile phone conversations among Saudi friends and relatives. Another goal is that to identify whether the opening sequences of mobile phone are similar or different from the landline telephone. The study will answer the following questions: what are the opening sequences and ritual expressions of mobile phone? And what are the similarities and differences between mobile phone and landline telephone in terms of the opening sequences. Thirty audio-recorded and transcribed mobile phone conversations served as the data source for this study. Data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by using the CA approach. Findings showed that the majority of opening sequences of mobile phone calls were reduced to three sequences: summons answer, greeting exchanges, and how-are-you exchanges due the impact of caller ID. In addition, the sequence of identification/recognition can be found when the caller does not know the callee or the number is silent.  Therefore, mobile phone and landline telephone have similarities and differences in the opening sequences in general. However, the differences observed can be a reason of the cultural practices for language use more than the effect of medium used in communication such as landline telephone and mobile phone in Saudi Arabic.

In fact, across disciplines and contexts, the amplification of 21st century learning has been giving gamification a special place in education. There are numerous studies conducted on the use of gamification among school children, university students or even trainee teachers. Coincidentally, all of these studies have shown that gamification does impact their learning. Hence, as harmless as it seems, any teachers who are not equipped with such knowledge on the benefits of gamification may hinder their learners and themselves from reaching their utmost teaching and learning experience especially when it comes to grammar learning among the younger pupils. Considering this thought in mind, this research was conducted to prove that the use of Kahoot! helps the Year 3 pupils in retaining the English Irregular verbs. This quasi – experimental designed research gathered data from a sample of 35 Year 3 pupils using the pre-test and post-test results. The findings which were analysed descriptively using sample t-test showed that pupils’ performances in the post-test improved over the use of Kahoot! in classroom. In conclusion, this research provides an insight on number of ways that gamification can actually impacted the pupils’ learning; especially in terms of memory retention.

It starts from the premise that online translation courses have peculiar epistemological and pedagogical characteristics which differ from those available in conventional teaching settings. The traditional styles of teaching translation courses have generally focused on linguistic competence and translation and interpreting skills with a little focus on the increasing demands and changing conditions of the translation industry. In spite of the effectiveness of online translation courses in addressing the needs of both translation students and labor market in terms of offering diverse programs and courses including computer-assisted translation tools, subtitling, document management, and localization software, different challenges remain unresolved. These challenges can be attributed to different factors including the lack of a reliable philosophy of teaching that addresses the peculiar epistemological and pedagogical characteristics of online learning. In order to explore the role of philosophy of teaching in the effectiveness and quality of online translation courses, twenty seven online instructors were interviewed about their philosophy of teaching and strategies of addressing the online learning problems and challenges. It is suggested that instructors’ unawareness about the peculiar nature of online learning and learners’ needs has negative implications on students’ achievement and online learning process in general. Online translation instructors are thus recommended to integrate different teaching philosophies in order to improve interaction with students, better understand their needs, and prepare them for the translation industry and labor market.",TRUE,FALSE,e-learning|online translation courses|pedagogy|teaching philosophy,2019-08-04T20:56:03.846878,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:55:43.737211,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/citation/,dn46x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4737913ce9350018f13941/,5d4737913ce9350018f13941,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dn46x/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dn46x

The present study questions whether there is a difference between paper-based and computer-based writing in terms of errors and lexico-grammar. It aims at exploring sentence-level errors and lexico-grammatical competence in two writing genres in a collaborative writing environment within paper-based and computer-based writing. A sample of 73 female intermediate level learners participated in the study at the University of Business and Technology (UBT), in Saudi Arabia. This mixed-methods research is significant in the literature of second language writing since it highlights genre awareness, lexico-grammatical competence, analyzing errors, and collaboration in two styles of writing. The reading-based writing tasks acted as a reflection of the learners' lexico-grammatical competence on paper and via Web 2.0 tool (Padlet). Statistically, the Mann-Whitney U-tests showed that there was no significant difference between paper-based and computer-based groups in the sentence-level errors in narrative genre, whereas there was a significant difference between the two different tools of writing groups in the sentence-level errors in opinion genre. However, there was no significant difference between paper-based and computer-based groups in the clauses (lexico-grammar) of the two groups. Immediate semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed through NVIVO to get more insights from the learners to explain the comparison between the paper-based and the computer-based writing.

With the introduction of Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), (Council of Europe, 2001) the emphasize for low proficient students to acquire vocabulary knowledge is crucial for them to move progressively into the next band as stated in the CEFR global scales. Yet, concerns arises as how the implementation of (CEFR) will impact the low proficient students with almost none to limited vocabulary acquisition. This poses an extremely high risk of these students being left far behind as English is a second language to most students. Thus, the aim of this study is to use blended learning to expand the vocabulary acquisition among low proficient students and enable them to move progressively in the CEFR band. The mixed method study employed questionnaires, face to face interviews, pre and post test and observations to collect data from 20 low proficient students aged 14 from a semi urban secondary school. Data collected were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The study found that using blended learning not only enhances low proficient students vocabulary count in CEFR English but it also promotes autonomous learning and understanding of sentence structures. Hence, the use of blended learning proves to be a crucial alternative for low proficient students to enhance their vocabulary knowledge and understanding of sentence structures through digital literacy that is capable of motivating and challenging them to achieve their highest potential.",TRUE,FALSE,|blended learning|CEFR|global scales|low proficiency|Malaysian context|vocabulary enhancement,2019-08-04T20:56:42.267803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:56:26.368606,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/citation/,ujqma,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4734ec3ce9350017ee425e/,5d4734ec3ce9350017ee425e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ujqma/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ujqma

Also, it investigates the nature of the proposed program, the efficiency of the program, and the significance differences between the two groups. The researcher used the experimental curriculum with the two groups; controlled and experimental to achieve the aims of the research and to test its hypotheses. The sample of the research consisted of 30 Students during the first term of the school year 2018/2019 and they were selected intentionally. Each group included 15 students. The experimental group students were trained to program the educational robotics using the computerized training program. Torrance test of creative thinking was applied before and after on the two groups, in addition to an evaluation card to the projects of the Students. The results showed that there are differences with statistical indication on the level of 0.5 between the two averages of the degrees of the experimental and the controlled groups, before and after the application of the creative thinking test and in the evaluation card of the Students' projects in the experimental group. By implication the research recommended to merge the techniques of the educational robotics and the artificial intelligence in teaching and education and training for provide the female teachers on using that technology and encouraging them to employ it in the process of teaching, using the electronic program prepared in this study.",TRUE,FALSE,Computer-mediated Training Program|Creative Thinking Skills|Educational Robotic,2019-08-04T20:57:02.537116,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:56:50.625103,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/citation/,bcm3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4733dabcd6d900178f3b0a/,5d4733dabcd6d900178f3b0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcm3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bcm3u/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bcm3u

With the dawn of technology and its various tools, exploring pronunciation and its effectiveness in successful communication attracts a bunch of scholarly attention. The use of Computer Assisted Language Learning opens the gateway for the possibility to integrate other tools in language learning as mobiles and gives birth to mobile learning or free education. In this vein, the incentive behind the current research work is in twofold:  to investigate the attitudes of both teachers and students towards the inclusion of mobiles in language learning, and to prove the effectiveness of this new approach in improving the listening and speaking skills of foreign language learners. To fulfill these aims, the researcher held an interview with 15 teachers teaching English at Dr Moulay Tahar University of Saida. The researcher also conducted a pretest and a posttest with 95 students of the second year from the same university. To this end, the findings revealed that both teachers and students have positive attitudes towards the introduction of mobile technology in language learning, even though some teachers still favor the traditional approaches of language teaching and learning. The results also demonstrated that the applications, used in the experiment, showed the usability of Mobile Assisted Language in learning English pronunciation.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes|EFL Learners|English pronunciation|Mobile Assisted Language Learning,2019-08-04T20:57:22.052337,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:57:09.480227,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/citation/,6ks52,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4732f5bcd6d9001692a1bd/,5d4732f5bcd6d9001692a1bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ks52/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ks52
