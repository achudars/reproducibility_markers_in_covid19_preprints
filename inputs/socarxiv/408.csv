Where intersections would typically be open to two-way traffic, in hundreds in cases in St. Louis they have been closed using concrete barriers or cul-de-sacs. These street closures are the outgrowth of a 1970s-era “defensible space” strategy to address rising crime rates. Oscar Newman, who is most closely associated with this paradigm, developed it while a faculty member in St. Louis. The city therefore is not only the birthplace but also one of the most significant test cases for its implementation. In this paper, we provide the most comprehensive data set of closures available, evaluate their location in the city, and assess their association with contemporary violent crime patterns. We find that barriers are located in neighborhoods that lost significant population between 1970 and 2016, particularly in North City and the northernmost reaches of South City. Critically, though the barriers are imagined as crime reduction tools and justified as such in City legislation, we find that they are associated with elevated violent crime rates at the neighborhood-level. This finding suggests significant limitations with “defensible space” strategies in St. Louis and elsewhere for addressing crime.",TRUE,FALSE,crime|defensible space|St. Louis|street closures|urban geography,2019-02-22T04:22:27.486087,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-22T04:22:03.583245,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/citation/,2wext,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sxuze/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/relationships/node/,sxuze,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6eeb8e82a3950018c98b13/,5c6eeb8e82a3950018c98b13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wext/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2wext/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2wext,NA

Scholars agree that the news media are key to movement organizations’ influence, helping them alter public discourse and effect political change, but often find that protest is covered non-substantively. Employing insights from literatures on historical institutionalism, the social organization of the news, and the consequences of movements, we elaborate an “institutional mediation” model that identifies the interactive effects on coverage of news institutions’ operating procedures, movement organizations’ characteristics and action, and political contexts.  Although movement actors suffer compound legitimacy deficits with journalists, the institutional mediation model identifies the openings news institutions provide, the movement organizational characteristics and collective action likely to induce substantive news treatment, and the political contexts that will amplify or dampen these effects. We derive four interactive hypotheses from this model addressing organizational identities, collective action, and political contexts on news outcomes.  We appraise the hypotheses with comparative and qualitative comparative analyses of more than 1000 individually coded articles discussing the five most-covered organizations of the 1960s U.S. civil rights movement across four national newspapers.

While systems of informal control are by their very nature more decentralized and unorganized, can systems of informal social control come to resemble centralized systems of formal control? This article offers a highly detailed empirical analysis of a particular form of informal social control in a highly observable setting over time: fist-fighting in the National Hockey League. Fighting is commonly understood to be both an instrument of retaliatory “self-help” exercised by all players, but also the semi-exclusive domain of “enforcers” or “goons” who are employed by teams to physically retaliate on behalf of their opponents and deter violent play in others. A 52-year record of nearly 30,000 fist fights between players is analyzed alongside other player statistics. An analysis of the player distribution, network structure, and in-game contexts of these fights demonstrates a gradual shift from a system of self-help to a system of specialized enforcement. This shift is connected to larger changes in the size of the league and the talent pool, processes of specialization at the level of the team, and the emergence of an unofficial “enforcer” role that motivates participation in fights for certain players.",TRUE,FALSE,hockey|sanctioning|social control|social networks,2019-02-22T04:23:28.401736,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-22T04:23:00.690492,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/citation/,j9qpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6eb3ca82a395001ac91d7f/,5c6eb3ca82a395001ac91d7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9qpd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9qpd,NA

Assuming a temporally unidirectional environment, our theory describes an intelligent agent as one who aims to perform intelligent acts. The intelligent act is an ongoing attempt made by an agent to predict the future of the self as well as the future of the part or whole of the entire environment. However, the outcome is always uncertain. Our theory categorizes human behavior into intelligent and non-intelligent actions. 
Applying this categorization on literary texts enables us to continuously portray characters as intelligent or non-intelligent entities based on their actions. This approach helps redefine the way we perceive agency in characters’ progression. By investigating depictions of uncertainties in characters, we consider characters as entities who are able to rupture conventions governing the need for character coherence and narrative closure in literary texts.

We take up the three empirical dimensions of self-determination that Ryan and Deci have distinguished in their motivational theory of psychological self-determination and transpose them to the collective level. On the dimension of autonomy, collective self-determination refers to the institutions and rules of a democratic communication order; on the competence dimension, it refers to citizens’ political efficacy beliefs; and on the dimension of social connectedness, collective self-determination denotes the existence of shared communicative spaces even across deep divides. This conception of self-determination allows us, on the one hand, to identify causal influences between the individual and collective levels and, on the other hand, helps bring into focus the problems of realizing self-determination in societal communication as well as potentials for their solution. In conclusion, we show how the contributions to this special issue relate to the three empirical dimensions and two levels of self-determination and highlight their respective normative relevance.",TRUE,FALSE,autonomy|competence|digital communication|empirical research|normative theory|self-determination|social connectedness,2019-02-20T15:36:48.624628,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T15:23:01.306316,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/citation/,s28yb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d6f6282a395001ac84e0c/,5c6d6f6282a395001ac84e0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s28yb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s28yb,https://doi.org/10.5771/1615-634X-2018-4-395

This article analyzes how lucky and unlucky outcomes influence future organizational learning, decision-making and performance. Team statistics and outcomes are analyzed over 769 National Football League seasons for 32 franchises from 1990-2015. Four specific sources of luck are identified and measured: 1) divergence of win outcomes from actual team quality; 2) difficulty of opposition; 3) fumble recovery rates and 4) player injuries. Teams and players have little or no influence over these lucky factors, which nevertheless influence game outcomes, and by extension, the careers of players and coaches. Luck alters game outcomes and in turn significantly influences the retention or firing of coaches and players, which shapes their career incentives and decision-making. In addition to negatively affecting future performance via distorted learning, luck can also generate perverse incentives; in this case, encouraging risk aversion and scapegoating.

The paper is an attempt to explore the imports of Bangladesh which is one of the most significant factors responsible for unfavorable trade balance of the country. The aim of the study is to intend some initiatives for an attempt to ultimately reshaping the trade balance of Bangladesh with her foreign trade partners. The paper examines the existence of the gravity theory for the imports of Bangladesh with its eight major trading partner countries- India, China, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, USA and Malaysia. The data set consists of yearly data from 1985 to 2003 in a panel approach. The paper comes across with the findings that the gravity theory is consistent with the imports of Bangladesh. That is, the geographical distance of Bangladesh with its partner countries has significant impacts on its imports. But in near future this may change because of different factors such as profitability, easy trade procedures, product delivery time etc. that influence the imports decision more than does the geographical distance. This paper finds mixed relationship between the GDP and imports of Bangladesh. It also shows that the imports of Bangladesh influence the domestic production very little because Bangladesh mostly imports consumer goods rather than capital goods. Moreover, the population of Bangladesh has significant impacts on imports which in turn implies that Bangladesh is not capable of producing adequate consumer goods to meet the increased demand resulted from high population growth. It also shows that partner countries‟ GDP has significant positive impacts and partner countries‟ population has mixed impact on imports of Bangladesh. This paper concludes that it will be an alarming situation for trade balance of Bangladesh if the imports continue to increase in such a pattern that the rate increases five to eight times more in respect of population increases and at the same time the ratio of capital goods in proportion of total imports decreases.",TRUE,FALSE,Geographical Distance|Gravity Model|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|Imports|Panel study|Population,2019-02-20T19:30:03.068902,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T19:28:29.484910,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/citation/,etmzk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mn8yw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/relationships/node/,mn8yw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d166f82a3950017c94948/,5c6d166f82a3950017c94948,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/etmzk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/etmzk,NA

Variants of this MC model are being implemented in more than 60 different countries of the world. It has become almost a universal antidote for poverty especially from 2006 when Professor Muhammad Yunus- the founder of the Grameen Bank (GB) and the bank itself shared the Nobel peace prize. Although the GB is the pioneer of MC program in Bangladesh, there are many other non-governmental organizations (NGO)s that offer the same program in Bangladesh in different forms and names. The providers of MCs claim that the overwhelming majority of the borrowers are using the loan funds profitably for productive purposes, repaying the loans and interest regularly, and thus improving their socio-economic conditions steadily. The findings of the present study are somewhat contrary and disturbing to the claim of the MC programs. This study finds that a bulk of the MC is borrowed for non productive purposes. About one quarter of the borrowers use the credit exclusively for consumption and debt repayment purposes. Nearly half of them use the credits entirely for investment purposes. For all, the return on investment is very meager. About two-third of the borrowers, on average have an impressive 83% net return on investment available for payment of interest and dividend in addition to the principal. But in case of as high as one third of them, average return on investment is not enough even to cover the most minimum or tolerance level of wages for family labors, let alone paying any interest and making any profit after keeping aside the principal.",TRUE,FALSE,implicit cost of labor|microcredit|microenterprise|Microlending|small business,2019-02-20T19:29:02.447801,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T19:28:14.585095,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/citation/,xh9na,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9hq4g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/relationships/node/,9hq4g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d150d62c82a001ad6442b/,5c6d150d62c82a001ad6442b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xh9na/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xh9na,https://doi.org/10.2753/0577-5132510608

In analyzing the effectiveness of microcredit program the microcredit providers (NGOs) use accounting profit of the borrowers’ enterprises ignoring implicit costs on the plea that the opportunity cost of labor is near zero in those countries. This plea is certainly not tenable. In this research we use the principle of economic profit taking into account the implicit cost of family labor. From the results of this pilot study we get the reflection that a bulk of the microcredit is borrowed for non productive purposes. As high as 24% of borrowers used the credit exclusively for consumption and debt repayment purposes, and therefore demand for payment of interest from them is nonsensical. Only 48 % of the borrowers used the credits entirely for investment purposes. However, they are faced with very low-return investment opportunities in rural areas. About 68% of them on average had an impressive 83% net return on investment available for payment of interest and dividend. But in case of as high as 32% of them average return on investment was not enough even to cover the most minimum or tolerance level of wages for family labors. In their cases any payment of interest for capital has to be at the expense of the sacrifice of this subsistence level wages of the family labors. They are trapped in a vicious circle of loans. In the absence of a built in mechanism for debt relief they have no scope to be freed from this bondage of debt. An Islamic microcredit model based on Mudarabah principle (whereby the lender and borrower share the business surplus/profit on an agreed ratio, but in case of loss the lender alone bears the loss) may be a better alternative for them. There are indications that it requires an investment of around Tk 12,000 for creating job opportunity for one rural labor for the whole year.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-20T14:36:41.668607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T14:32:16.126396,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/citation/,hgpvk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m2g69/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/relationships/node/,m2g69,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d135462c82a0019d69352/,5c6d135462c82a0019d69352,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hgpvk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hgpvk,NA
