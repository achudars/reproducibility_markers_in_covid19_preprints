S. Naipaul’s The Mimic Men,"This paper investigates the notion of uprootnedness and cultural shipwreck in the Trinidadian novelist V. S. Naipaul’s novel The Mimic Men (1967). Although the novel’s fictional island may stand for Trinidad, this paper stresses the fact that, according to Naipaul, the disordered Isabella may well match the characteristics of other chaotic Third World nations. The narrator-protagonist symbolizes more of the disillusionment worthy of Naipaul’s other placeless characters like Salim in A Bend in the River and Mr. Biswas in A House for Mr Biswas. This means that Naipaul tries a writing of a (hi)story that adheres to his personal idiosyncrasies and beliefs, a narrative in which he exposes the abnormalities and pretences of a society in which nothing seems sure and lasting. As the title of the novel suggests, the pattern is that of mimicry; postcolonial countries, all together lacking a sense of creativity, duplicate and distort metropolitan models. Thus, this paper sheds light in the tunnel between the ‘us’ (Europeans) and the ‘them’ (Caribbean) arguing that for Naipaul the first stands for authenticity and reality while the second signifies mimicry and unreality.",TRUE,FALSE,alienation|homelessness|mimicry uprootedness|V.

It is a dynamic and ever changing process. It is expected to respond positively to new developments in the studies of language and style. Cognitive stylistics is one of the major new developments in the study of style. It is based on viewing and analyzing style as a cognitive process of mind that goes beyond the boundaries of surface meaning to unearth the truth behind it. This process draws heavily on the cultural, social, political, and ideological conceptualization of style and meaning. The cognitive process of translating is claimed here to have been influenced by contemporary cognitive stylistic approaches that view meaning as the product of style as mind. This paper investigates the updated cognitive properties, responsibilities, practices and other characteristics to be assumed by the cognitive stylistic translator in the light of these new cognitive approaches to meaning and style in terms of mind. Accordingly, the cognitive translator is urged to approach the translation of the texts' styles and meaning cognitively to respond creatively to the explorations of cognitive stylistic theory and applications. This will make them uncover buried truths and meanings that cannot be discovered otherwise. Toward the end of the paper, a relativity theory of cognitive stylistic translation is put forward. This theory is flexible enough to respond effectively to all cognitive potentials of meaning and style. Further, it accommodates more than one cognitive version of translation by means of applying two suggested methods of translation to the same text: direct (or style-based); and indirect (non-style-based). This means that more freedom of choice of possible versions of translation is available to translators and readers to pick up.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive|style|style-based translation|stylistic|translation method|translation theory|translator,2018-07-02T11:39:47.663353,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:34:53.865001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/citation/,hjnx2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ceh5q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/relationships/node/,ceh5q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba227571031000e44db18/,5a8ba227571031000e44db18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjnx2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hjnx2/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hjnx2

The human psyche is complicated; it is a mix of emotions, instincts, actions ad reactions. The 20th century is revolutionary, new inventions and discoveries were trending, with the new way of living people started to lose faith.  William Golding's Free Fall as Künstlerroman is tracing the development of the artist Sammy Mountjoy's character from childhood until he matures. The things he faced and the factors that reshaped his life. He was chastened by suffering as he learned from the school of life. In this non-thesis paper, a study of the character of Sammy as he grows up is explored with examining the factors that affected his personality. The introduction illustrates Künstlerroman as a subgenre of Bildungsroman and explains them as a theoretical framework, the difference between them and their characteristics. Also, it discusses psychoanalysis definition. Chapter I will focus on Sammy's childhood living in Rotten Row and his friends, the role of his parents and moving to the art school where he met Beatrice.

Flynn makes an appeal for researchers to move beyond psychology’s standard disciplinary boundaries and to consider sociological contexts, in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive inequalities. In this article we respond to this appeal and investigate social class inequalities in general cognitive ability test scores over time. We analyse data from the National Child Development Study (1958) and the British Cohort Study (1970). These two British birth cohorts are suitable nationally representative large-scale data resources for studying inequalities in general cognitive ability.
We observe a large parental social class effect, net of parental education and gender in both cohorts. The overall finding is that large social class divisions in cognitive ability can be observed when children are still at primary school, and similar patterns are observed in each cohort. Notably, pupils with fathers at the lower end of the class structure are at a distinct disadvantage.

Yet there is little empirical research into the use of notice and takedown or its effectiveness. Because it depends on the private communications and actions of copyright holders, online service providers, and targets, notice and takedown operates largely within a difficult-to-study “black box.” This article contributes to the literature with an empirical look at two sets of takedown notices. It digests findings from two quantitative studies of takedown notices in the Lumen database, reported fully in the three-study report, Notice and Takedown in Everyday Practice (available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2755628), and peer-reviewed here. 

The first study, of notices sent to Google Web Search, shows a heavy reliance by large rightsholders on automated infringement detection and notification, and tends to support their assertions that they focus their enforcement resources on large-scale infringement. At the same time, 31% of these notices raised questions related to their accuracy and statutory compliance. The second study provides a snapshot of takedown as used by one set of smaller notice senders — individuals and small businesses sending to Google Image Search. In this study, notices were more likely to target social media sites, blogs, and personal websites, and 70% of the notices raised questions. While both studies revealed surprisingly high percentages of notices of questionable validity, the questions raised tended to differ. The automated notices in the first study predominantly exhibited issues identifying the works in question, while the notices sent by smaller rightsholders in the second study predominantly exhibited issues with the underlying claim. Accordingly, while notice sending appears to need improvement, there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach. Both “worlds” of notice sending need to be accommodated. We therefore suggest a set of voluntary best practices, educational efforts, and modest legal reforms directed to the different issues we observed.",TRUE,FALSE,copyright|copyright enforcement|empirical|infringement|intermediary liability|notice and takedown|section 512|takedown,2018-07-02T11:39:47.419626,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T09:34:46.421605,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/citation/,mduyn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n36ct/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/relationships/node/,n36ct,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8b2d5d60511e000ddc4902/,5a8b2d5d60511e000ddc4902,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mduyn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mduyn

But despite its influence, there is little empirical research describing § 512's operation or its effectiveness.

Through detailed surveys and interviews with nearly three dozen respondents, we provide the first detailed account of how § 512 is implemented and experienced by online service providers and large rightsholders. All respondents agreed that the § 512 safe harbors and the ability to take down infringing material remain fundamental. But the online copyright enforcement ecosystem is also highly diverse, and all participants face challenges.

The survey aimed to assess the vitality of approximately 30 languages spoken by Tibetans in China. ‘Vitality’ can be roughly defined as an indicator of a language’s chances of being sustained in the future – if vitality is low, the language is less likely to be spoken in the future, if the vitality is high, it probably will. 

Data were collected on 20 languages (see Appendix 1 for further information). This data consisted of expert testimony from linguists and anthropologists who are intimately familiar with the demographic, social, political, cultural contexts in which the languages are spoken (see Appendix 2 for details). Questions consisted of multiple choice and Likert scale questions; opportunity for open comment was also provided.

It is at the core of social media platforms and everyday interactions. It is also being rapidly adopted for research and discovery across academia, business and government. This paper will explore the way the affordances of machine learning itself, and the forms of social apparatus that it becomes a part of, will potentially erode ethics and draw us in to a drone-like perspective. Unconstrained machine learning enables and delimits our knowledge of the world in particular ways: the abstractions and operations of machine learning produce a ‘view from above’ whose consequences for both ethics and legality parallel the dilemmas of drone warfare. The family of machine learning methods is not somehow inherently bad or dangerous, nor does implementing them signal any intent to cause harm. Nevertheless, the machine learning assemblage produces a targeting gaze whose algorithms obfuscate the legality of its judgements, and whose iterations threaten to create both specific injustices and broader states of exception. Given the urgent need to provide some kind of balance before machine learning becomes embedded everywhere, this paper proposes people’s councils as a way to contest machinic judgements and reassert openness and discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithms|artificial intelligence|big data|ethics|Giorgio Agamben|Hannah Arendt|law|machine learning|people's councils|politics|state of exception,2018-07-02T11:39:45.733354,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-17T19:37:24.282119,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/citation/,sjpmc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wcnbu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/relationships/node/,wcnbu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a87e0137166bd000eba13fe/,5a87e0137166bd000eba13fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjpmc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjpmc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sjpmc
