Unlike the traditional view of who teachers are, nowadays conceptualization considers teachers not only as reservoirs of knowledge but individuals that inspire other individuals in unique ways. Teacher professional identity exhibits teachers’ beliefs, emotions, and teaching philosophies. Among other aspects, teacher emotions are a strong indicator of teacher professional identity; therefore, unless teachers are better equipped with cognitive strategies to regulate their emotions and are more emotionally intelligent, achieving their teaching and non-teaching goals will remain a forlorn dream.  The current paper encapsulated various aspects of teacher emotions and emotion regulation models and has sought to answer the following overarching research question: How do emotions influence teacher professional identity and how do Saudi EFL teachers regulate their emotions? Hence, the factors that lead to Saudi English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers’ emotional arousal and disturbances have been critically summarized. Finally, the applications of emotion regulation models in the Saudi EFL context have been highlighted. The theoretical conceptualizations presented in this paper have implications for EFL teachers, teacher trainers, and professional development specialists.",TRUE,FALSE,Emotion regulations|Saudi EFL context|teacher emotions|teacher professional identity,2020-10-09T18:17:22.928355,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:17:06.369966,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/citation/,36wtv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e70fea5e947011e1bf35f/,5f7e70fea5e947011e1bf35f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36wtv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/36wtv/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.24,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/36wtv

In an attempt to guide EFL teachers on their journey towards transforming their traditional paper-based formative assessment into using electronic tools, this study seeks to present the expectations and attitudes of Saudi female learners towards the use of mobile-based formative assessment.  The study aims to investigate the attitudes of EFL learners towards the use of mobile-based tests in English classes using Socrative as a model for assessment.  For this purpose, 35 female students completed all three stages of the experiment; initial survey, Socrative quiz, post-experiment survey.  The participants are enrolled in one of the courses of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) offered by the Preparatory Year Program at a Saudi state university.  The findings of the study indicate that almost half of the participants preferred paper-based over mobile-based tests in the pre-experiment survey; after the experiment, however, the students changed their preferences in favor of mobile-based tests.

Listening plays an essential role in both communication and learning, and it is one of the most crucial necessary language skills in the field of language learning. Recent studies in foreign language listening have extensively focused on the prevailing difficulties of listening. There has been little research on the cultural- background as a sociolinguistic dimension of listening. Therefore, this study set out to determine whether Saudi EFL students face particular difficulty in their listening comprehension, to identify possible reasons for the problems, and to find out whether the cultural- background affects the listening process. To achieve these objectives, a triangulation method was followed. A diagnostic test and a questionnaire were used on a group of 31 Saudi students of English and a reflective essay was carried out on eight EFL teachers. The findings suggest, first, that listening is the most challenging language skill and, second, that Saudi EFL students encounter substantial difficulty in the perception, parsing, and utilization phases of their listening comprehension for many reasons. The findings also suggest that the cultural background has a significant effect on their listening process.

To do so, the researchers have set two objectives which are phrased as follows: firstly, examining the pragma-stylistic choices that are used to surface the deceptive strategies on the character-character level in the pre-dénouement stage and secondly, investigating the pragma-stylistic choices that are used to surface the deceptive strategies on the narrator-reader level in the pre-dénouement stage.

Therefore, the study at issue follows an eclectic conceptual framework which comprises Merzah and Abbas’s deceptive principle (2020) and Chen’s (2001) self-politeness, along with the stylistic effects achieved via the manipulation of such linguistic tools, to explore the two levels of discourse, namely, character-character level and narrator-reader level proposed by Black (2006).

(A Re-examination of the Accusations Made against the Prescriptive Tradition),"This paper seeks to intellectually stimulate researchers who are interested in the history of grammar and the long-standing debate about prescriptivism. Contrary to popular belief, there are scholars who still put forward arguments about the significant role played by prescriptive grammar in the development of Modern Standard English. Such counter-arguments are usually absent in many introductory textbooks to linguistics, which portray prescriptive grammar in a negative light. Nonetheless, only by listening to both sides of the debate, researchers can make a more objective judgment, avoid reductionist views, and encourage students of linguistics to engage in critical thinking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to re-examine the accusations made against prescriptive grammar by investigating various sources that give a different perspective on the origins and significance of the prescriptive tradition. The study has found that there is a strong connection between the prescriptive school of grammar and the development and preservation of Modern Standard English. Instead of being an impediment, the prescriptive approach that began in the 18th Century was a historical necessity at a time when linguistic variations were out of proportion and accepted standards were absent. The founders of this school did a great service to the English-speaking world by their contributions to the creation of a standard variety that has facilitated communication between speakers of diverse dialects of English. Unfortunately, the merits of this school have been buried by blanket accusations that lack careful analysis of what the works of prescriptive grammarians contained. The study has also shown how the dismissal of the prescriptive grammar can have negative outcomes and why it is important to re-examine the allegations made against it by modern linguists.",TRUE,FALSE,|descriptive grammar|language change|meaning shift|prescriptive grammar|standard language|vernaculars,2020-10-09T18:33:42.081049,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:33:22.089887,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/citation/,3tqe5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e6c47a5e94701171bce50/,5f7e6c47a5e94701171bce50,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tqe5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3tqe5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3tqe5

The attempt is also made to account for the possible linguistic factors which may affect this inflection in light of some theories in morphology. The analysis is based on more than 250 loanwords collected from different sources (dictionaries, social, media, and TV series). The results showed that foreign nouns are found to be marked for all types of plural (broken plural (BP), female sound plural (FSP), and masculine sound plural (MSP)). More than 77% of borrowed nouns are inflected for FSP. However, this result disagrees with the plural formation rule operating in native nominal stems, which states that BP is the most common, and SP seldom occurs. Views from morphology theory as proposed by Abd-Rabbo (1990) and McCarthy and Prince (1990a; 1990b) were employed to account for this phenomenon. Another feature which is also peculiar to FSP formation is related to the attachment of –ha:t and –ya:t to singular borrowed nouns to form FSP instead of -a:t. Like plural marking, gender assignment to borrowed nouns is also subject to the CSA rules. All English loan nouns are inflected either for masculine by attaching the f morpheme (the unmarked) or feminine gender by attaching –ah (the marked). Out of the three functions of the feminine marker –ah introduced by Drozdík (1998), the inflectional function is the only function that is found at work within foreign nouns. The study concludes with recommendations for further research on loanword variation with regard to plural formation and other morpho-syntactic processes across the different dialects of Arabic. discourse intonation, dominance/non-dominance, pitch level, proclaiming tone, praat program, referring tone",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-09T18:33:03.434728,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:32:38.702838,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/citation/,thwf3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e6a461f65a5013bed19de/,5f7e6a461f65a5013bed19de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thwf3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/thwf3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/thwf3

The significance of this study is that it will provide an in-depth understanding of the strategies and structures of code-switching used to address children in order to teach them English. The study addresses two research questions: 1) What are the patterns of code-switching found in the interaction of the cartoon characters in Dora the Explorer? 2) What is the function of code-switching in each pattern? Quantitative analysis was used to analyze the frequency of each pattern of code-switching, while qualitative analysis was used to determine the functions of code-switching. The results show several patterns of code-switching into English: code-switching from Arabic to English without translation; Arabic lexical items followed by an English translation; English lexical items followed by an Arabic translation; translation from Arabic into English in two turns; and metadiscursive code-switching. English lexical items are introduced through code-switching in each episode. English words without translation account for the highest percentage of code-switching. In the code-switching to English, some English units are permanent, while some are context units that depend on the episode topic: these include basic formulaic and non-formulaic expressions. Lexical items for greeting, appreciation, and evaluation are the most frequent pragmatic functions of code-switching. Further research is recommended on code-switching in other TV animated series in other languages to determine the patterns of code-switching and the part of speech that is the focus of switching.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic|Cartoons|Code-switching|Dora the Explorer|English|Formulaic|Non-formulaic,2020-10-09T18:32:22.500018,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:32:13.593191,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/citation/,ayt9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e698d1f65a5013aed0f05/,5f7e698d1f65a5013aed0f05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayt9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ayt9k/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ayt9k

The research methodology employed an observational study based using critical applied linguistic.  Data collection was through a mixed method. The tools used were the Cambridge English: Key English Test (KET), classroom observation evaluation forms, and interviews. The participants consisted of 252 upper primary students from one private school in Chiang Mai, Thailand, during the academic year 2019. Results indicated that students’ English proficiency was increased significantly at .01 level in both groups. The gain score suggested that NNEST can make a higher gain score than NEST in all grade levels.  Student’s answers show NNEST score a higher agreeability towards teachers’ teaching abilities, English abilities, and the creation of an engaging learning atmosphere over NEST. Classroom observations implemented by three English Learning Teachers confirmed the results that NNEST is more agreeable than NEST in teachers’ teaching ability and motivating learning atmospheres in classrooms. However, in teachers’ English skills, the experts’ perceptions were opposite that of the students. Lastly, the interviews with the students reflected three key aspects: their preferences of English teacher advantages, disadvantages, and strengths of both NNEST and NEST.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-09T18:32:01.960878,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:31:53.097798,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/citation/,7sqy3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e68761f65a5013bed1242/,5f7e68761f65a5013bed1242,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqy3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7sqy3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7sqy3
