opportunities and generate mobilization for the other side. However, there
are still open questions as to how this influence between opposing
movements operates on an organizational level. This paper looks closely at
one aspect of the impact of opposing movements: rhetorical strategies. I
examine historical documents produced by social movement organizations to
determine the processes through which interactions between opposing
movements are integrated into the everyday work of producing movement
claims. This historical analysis evaluates the flyers, newsletters, and
press releases of lesbian and gay movement organizations in the United
States over time, comparing documents produced before the emergence of the
Christian antigay countermovement in 1977, with those produced immediately
following the countermovementâ€™s entry into the political scene. I analyze
the shifts in lesbian and gay activists' claims between these two brief
time periods and link these changes to the presence of Christian antigay
activists. I find that frames, tone, and language shift for issues that
were directly addressed by the Christian antigay movement (lesbian and gay
rights), but that no similar change was present for issues on which the
antigay movement remained silent (police harassment and lesbian/gay media
representations). These findings support the claim that opposing movements
alter the political context in which the other side works, but they also
demonstrate that new opportunities produced by an opposing movement may be
issue-specific rather than movement-wide.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:26.525806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-20T20:12:57.953000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/citation/,bv94r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pdjv6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/relationships/node/,pdjv6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578fdb4bb83f6901f6dad27f/,578fdb4bb83f6901f6dad27f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bv94r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bv94r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bv94r

actively opposing equality for LGBTQ people. Students at GSA schools

clinical interactions are primarily driven by physiciansâ€™ perception of
relevance. These perceptions of relevance depend on the physicianâ€™s own
biographical background. While some physicians will perceive a connection
between religion and patient health, this relevance will be less apparent
for others. I argue here that physician responses when religious/spiritual
topics come up during clinical interactions will depend on their own
religious/spiritual background. The more central religion is for the
physician, as reflected by their religious/spiritual orientation, intrinsic
religiosity, and religious coping, the greater their perception of
religionâ€™s impact on health outcomes and their inclusion of
religion/spirituality within clinical interactions. Using a nationally
representative sample of physicians in the U.S. and mediated path models, I
estimate models for five different physician actions to evaluate these
relationships. I find that a physicianâ€™s religious background is strongly
associated with whether or not they think religion impacts health outcomes,
which is strongly predictive of inclusion. I also find that not all of the
association between inclusion and physiciansâ€™ religious background is
mediated by thinking religion impacts health outcomes. Issues of religionâ€™s
