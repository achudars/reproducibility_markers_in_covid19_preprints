The creation of IALs surged in the late 19th century as a response to rising nationalism; through their sociopolitical neutrality and ease of learning, IALs sought to introduce unity to a divided world. Though IAL adoption remains limited, their speakers still believe that given the ability to spread, IALs could unite our global community. To examine group trends and individual perspectives in how IALs may influence identity and perception, I surveyed and interviewed an online Esperantist community. I also performed close reading of randomly-selected posts on online forums for Esperanto, Volapük, and Toki Pona, as well as the general forum Linguistics and Conlangs. Finally, I analyzed content for six months of posts from the Volapük and Toki Pona forums. Most speakers (68.8%) self-reported that IALs changed their perception and, fewer (34.4%), beliefs.  Survey respondents and interviewees cited community membership, broader communication, and IALs’ simplified linguistic features as influences on their worldviews. Accordingly, more years speaking Esperanto, seeking and feeling part of Esperanto communities, and believing the world would be a better place with more IAL adoption significantly correlated with change in beliefs. Different IAL forums statistically differed in their content, interactivity, and post length, which may reflect language-influenced disparities. The results suggest that IALs may affect the beliefs of learners in relation to their community-building properties and widening of communication ranges and impact the perceptions of learners through their unique structures.",TRUE,FALSE,community|conlang|constructed languages|content analysis|descriptive survey|Esperanto|Facebook|IAL|international auxiliary languages|linguistic relativity|social media|social networks|standardized open-ended interview|Toki Pona|Volapük,2018-09-24T17:29:45.460457,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-24T17:29:25.696914,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e00|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/citation/,sj24a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yvf5a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/relationships/node/,yvf5a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba7db6c9108ce0015f5aec5/,5ba7db6c9108ce0015f5aec5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj24a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sj24a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sj24a,NA

Here, we remark that De Viti’s theory of the cooperative state appears grounded only on the principles of minimum means and of political competition, and on the assumption that individual income is a proxy of individual consumption of general public services.

Although scholars recognize that party leaders dominate the structure and content of meetings, little empirical research examines the extent of their agenda setting role. Who gets to speak and whose preferences get represented? Adapting theories of legislative agenda setting to the intra-party context, we hypothesize that party candidates are less likely to be chosen as speakers at party conferences when the party’s leadership most demands unity due to their incumbency status. Using self-placements from candidate surveys, we predict the likelihood that MPs and leaders speak at parties’ national meetings in the U.K. We then link candidates’ self-placements to the content of speeches using automated text analysis. These results add to a broad theory of party decision-making which perceives parties’ national meetings as a forum for information sharing, intra-party competition and deliberation.

Considering segregation as a social form of entropy resolves that struggle and introduces a family of related measures that offer means of analysing segregation at both the local (neighbourhood) level and the greater (city/region) area. A case study of Philadelphia's level of segregation from 1990 to 2010 illustrates the benefits of the new measures. While Philadelphia has diversified, it remains racially segregated. Further, the new measures show the growing importance of Hispanic segregation and a shift from segregation being visited upon the city's Black residents to being driven by a White population that grows more segregated as its population share shrinks.

We show that this assumption accurately describes enrollment patterns for higher-status colleges and universities, but not institutions across the field of higher education. We use fixed effects modeling to analyze the association between a stated affirmative action admissions policy and enrollment trends for first-year students of different racialized backgrounds between 1990 and 2016 at 1,127 selective institutions. We find that, at the most selective institutions, stated policy usage was associated with increased Black student enrollments. However, at less selective institutions, policy usage was associated with decreased Black enrollments and increased Non-U.S. resident enrollments. We also identify close-to-zero estimates of this relationship for enrollment trends of additional demographic backgrounds. We use these findings to elaborate the role of field-level status dynamics in racialized organizations theory. Paradoxically, U.S. American higher education's contemporary racialized status order roughly consists of higher-status institutions that consider race in admissions but do not enroll racially heterogenous cohorts, middle-status institutions that do not consider race but enroll racially heterogenous cohorts, and lower-status non-selective institutions that enroll disproportionately high numbers of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students.

Recent scholarship has drawn attention to the way that the occupations involved with cultural production, brought together under the banner of cultural and creative industries (CCIs), do not reflect the demographics of British society. In particular, research has demonstrated significant exclusions based on gender (e.g. Conor et al 2015), race and ethnicity (e.g. Saha 2018, Nwonka and Malik 2018), and class (e.g. Hesmondhalgh 2018). This paper seeks to understand how these inequalities are maintained by looking at a comparatively under-researched group: senior men in positions of power making decisions in CCIs. The paper presents data from 32 interviews with senior men across a range of CCI occupations, conducted as part of a larger set (N=237) of interviews on inequality and careers in CCIs. The analysis shows that misrecognition and outright rejection of inequalities is now unusual; that ‘inequality talk’ and the recognition of structural barriers for marginalised groups is a dominant mode for senior CCI men; that gentlemanly tropes and the idea of luck, rather than structural advantages, were used by senior men to explain their own success and separate and distance them as individuals from the inequalities they described; and that men felt they had limited capacity to effect genuine change in the context of a set of occupations they understood as fairer than other professions. Overall, the analysis shows how ‘inequality talk’ and the awareness of structural issues differs significantly from senior CCI men’s own accounts of their career success. This difference, and the distance between the discourse of career luck and ‘inequality talk’ helps to explain the persistence of exclusions from the workforce for those who are not white, middle class origin, men. This has important implications for inequality in other professions and areas of social life.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural and creative industries|inequality|senior men|sociology of culture,2018-09-21T13:37:20.903007,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-21T13:26:22.844935,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Orian Brook|Dave O'Brien|Mark Taylor,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/citation/,y6db7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vhpqu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/relationships/node/,vhpqu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba4f0bf15b1070019b4cbf8/,5ba4f0bf15b1070019b4cbf8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6db7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y6db7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y6db7,NA

However, past research suggests that machine learning systems often produce biased output. In this article, we evaluate potential gender biases of commercial image recognition platforms using photographs of U.S. members of Congress and a large number of Twitter images posted by these politicians. Our crowdsourced validation shows that commercial image recognition systems can produce labels that are correct and biased at the same time as they selectively report a subset of many possible true labels. We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men. We discuss how encoded biases such as these affect the visibility of women, reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, and limit the validity of the insights that can be gathered from such data.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|google vision|image recognition|political behavior,2018-09-21T10:47:00.997096,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-21T10:45:27.868033,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/2CEYWV,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/citation/,as25q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n9wks/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/relationships/node/,n9wks,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba4b52b5a7172001ae448a6/,5ba4b52b5a7172001ae448a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/as25q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/as25q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/as25q,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023120967171
