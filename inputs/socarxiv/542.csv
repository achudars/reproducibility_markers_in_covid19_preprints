Paying attention to social interaction as encompassed in these advertisements is crucial to understanding the place of online forms of matrimonial matchmaking in the urban and middle-class social imaginary in contemporary India. These micro-level interactions provide a productive site of inquiry in understanding the discursive production of a ‘new middle class’ in India and the politics of that public culture. I find that the concept of ‘choice’ is crucial to the validation of online matchmaking. Traditional forms of matchmaking are not displaced or ruptured as much as reinforced in a language of choice rather than coercion. While this seems like a predictable pattern in neoliberal culture, what I point out in this paper is the centrality of ‘technology’ in mediating the process of validating ideas and values associated with the institution of marriage by arrangement. In enabling a convenient negotiation between aspirational modernity via consumer choice and traditional norms of matchmaking via the displacement of a human agent as broker, online matrimonial sites make the reproduction of institution of marriage not just possible, but also desirable.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:42:13.263575,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-12T13:15:50.795517,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/citation/,54pdb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pt6fa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/relationships/node/,pt6fa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa668627b3db90010a80402/,5aa668627b3db90010a80402,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54pdb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/54pdb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/54pdb,NA

Three broad explanatory models can be derived from literature on the sociology of social sciences: (1) worldview, arguing that intellectual preferences reflect general cultural and political orientations of broad social groupings to which an individual belongs; (2) status, according to which all forms of hierarchies are reproduced in the academic field through preferences for innovative research by those occupying dominant positions and their avoidance by agents lacking resources; (3) ecological, holding that opportunity structures existing at the historical moment at which an individual enters the academic field determines the theory choice. We analyse the adoption of a Russian variety of the indigenous sociology intellectual movement and a corresponding counter-movement to explore the biographical antecedents of choosing one side over the other in an important disciplinary debate. In doing so, we rely on statistical data from a community study of sociology in Leningrad-St Petersburg between 1984 and 2011. The worldview hypothesis finds the strongest support; choice of declared preference for national or international scholarship reflects more general liberal or conservative attitudes characteristic of certain milieus existing in Russian society.",TRUE,FALSE,indigenous sociology|intellectual movements|sociology in Russia|sociology of knowledge|sociology of sociology,2018-07-02T11:42:12.691894,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-11T13:15:26.900409,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology",Mikhail Sokolov (author),2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/citation/,62sj9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d7epa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/relationships/node/,d7epa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa507907b3db9000ea7f96c/,5aa507907b3db9000ea7f96c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62sj9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/62sj9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/62sj9,https://doi.org/10.1177/0011392118811392

We examine self-proclaimed ‘citizen-focus’ projects funded by or aligned to the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC) by way of analysing policy documents and interviews with key stakeholders of smart city initiatives at European level and the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona (SCEWC 2017). We suggest that smart cities as currently conceived enact a blueprint of neoliberal urbanism and promote a form of neoliberal citizenship. Supra-national institutions like the EIP-SCC act at a multi-scalar level, connecting diverse forms of neoliberal urbanism while promoting policy agendas and projects that perform neoliberal citizenship in the spaces of the everyday. Despite attempts to recast the smart city as ‘citizen-focused’, smart urbanism remains rooted in pragmatic, instrumental and paternalistic discourses and practices rather than those of social rights, political citizenship, and the common good. In our view, if smart cities are to become truly ‘citizen-focused’ an alternative conception of smart citizenship needs to be deployed, one that enables an effective shift of power and is rooted in rights, entitlements, community, participation, commons, and ideals beyond the market.",TRUE,FALSE,citizenship|European Union|neoliberalism|smart cities|smart citizens,2018-07-02T11:42:11.103661,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-09T13:01:17.516808,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/citation/,xugb5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sv478/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/relationships/node/,sv478,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa2789d01e207000d442d23/,5aa2789d01e207000d442d23,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugb5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xugb5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xugb5,NA

One of these institutions is the Dispute Resolution Council (DRC), which has been established in recent years to deal with claims based on the citizen participation strategy. This council was legally established after the approval of Article 189 in the Third Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan Code.Findings of this study revealed that law of the DRC has undergone several innovations and changes in the DRC Code of 2015, including: a change in the number of councilors and its top officials and the possibility of using retired judges as the council judges, that neither the DRC nor its judge is allowed to issue any decree; they can only issue corrective reports, and the implicit acceptance of the council's competence owing to lack of citation in the first session is just limited to Article 8 and the  competence of the council rather than the judge.

An analysis of literary tastes of occupational groups,"Looking for differences in tastes of macrosocial units, such as classes or status groups, has been sociology of culture’s preoccupation for decades. The recent turn to the study of “micro-classes” (Grusky, 2005) in the sociology of stratification, however, questions the reality of such entities, suggesting rather that individual occupations are the real building blocks of social structures and, by implication, a natural site of differences in lifestyles. There have so far been few attempts in the sociology of culture to disaggregate classes into specific occupations in order to study potential contrasts in their artistic tastes, as this requires extensive datasets usually unavailable from surveys. In this paper, we begin to fill this gap using a dataset from the public library system of a major Russian city. Using information on the literary preferences of 15,470 readers who gave their current employment details, we show that indeed there are striking contrasts between occupational groups, with only a minor part of those existing contrasts captured by the class and socioeconomic status scales having the widest currency (ISEI, Treiman, EGP). We discuss several interpretations of this failure of conventional status schema: (a) inapplicability of socioeconomic status schemata to Russia; (b) the existence of strong micro-class cultures; (c) the presence of “economic” and “cultural” dimensions of status, implicating two different ordering of occupations; and (d) difference between occupational and class mobility, and the role of cultural consumption as a strategy of managing discrepancy between class and occupation.",TRUE,FALSE,artistic tastes|cultural consumption|micro-classes|occupations|sociology of culture|sociology of culture;,2018-07-02T11:42:10.448028,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-09T00:07:38.515935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nadezhda Sokolova|Mikhail Sokolov (authors),2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/citation/,5tvfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wutnd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/relationships/node/,wutnd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa19731f25d10000d3a90d6/,5aa19731f25d10000d3a90d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tvfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5tvfd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5tvfd,NA

An analysis of fiction readership in Russia,"In his paper establishing the foundations of omnivorousness theory, Richard Peterson suggested that the system of tastes is organized as a pyramid “with one elite taste at the top and more and more alternative forms at about the same level as one moves down the pyramid toward its base”, with tastes at the bottom “mark[ing] the status boundaries between taste groups defined by age, gender, race, region, religion, lifestyle” (1992). High-status individuals are likely to consume a few genres at all levels of the taste pyramid, while low-status ones tend to patronise only one genre situated at the bottom. While one of the predictions following from this model —concerning the omnivorounsness of privileged groups—has been tested in numerous studies, the thesis of stronger structural embeddedness of low-brow tastes has been researched much less extensively. If Peterson is right, we would find that the consumption of high-brow objects strongly correlates with class characteristics, such as education, although consumption of low- and middle-brow does not; on the contrary, the consumption of low-brow objects correlates with belonging to gender, age, ethnic, or other groupings, where the consumption of high-brow objects does not. In this paper, we use a dataset from a Saint Petersburg public library system to analyze 1 900 000 book choices of above 170 000 readers to find out whether these predictions hold. We find that there is indeed a strong negative correlation between the attractiveness of an author for predominantly educated readers and the gender and age specificity of his/her audience. In the second part of the article we discuss two possible theoretical explanation of this finding: (a) the opposition between the high-grid culture of unprivileged groups and the low-grid culture of elites, as described in Mary Douglas’ “cultural theory”, and (b) the opposition between relaxational and self-cultivating usages of culture.",TRUE,FALSE,Big Data|cultural consumption|literary tastes|Mary Douglas|Russian culture,2018-07-02T11:42:10.413861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-09T00:04:29.459117,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nadezhda Sokolova|Mikhail Sokolov (authors),2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/citation/,zf8m2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/czp2y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/relationships/node/,czp2y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa172c3f25d10000f3a111f/,5aa172c3f25d10000f3a111f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf8m2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zf8m2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zf8m2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.11.008
