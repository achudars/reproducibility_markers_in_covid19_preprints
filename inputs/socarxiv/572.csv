First, what are the problematic consequences of life mediated by ‘algorithm machines’? Second, how are individuals or groups and associations resisting the problems they encounter? Third, how might the algorithmic age be re-envisioned and re-made in more normative terms? We focus on two key aspects of living with ubiquitous computing, ‘acceleration’ and ‘data grabbing,’ which we contend are two of the most prominent and problematic features of the algorithmic age. We then begin to shed light on the sorts of practices that constitute slow computing responses to these issues. In the conclusion, we make the case for a widescale embrace of slow computing, which we propose is a necessary step for society to make the most of the undeniable opportunities for radical social change emerging from contemporary technological developments.",TRUE,FALSE,acceleration|algorithmic governance|big data|resistance|slow computing|ubiquitous computing,2018-07-02T11:27:28.831703,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-06T13:28:25.312315,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/citation/,rmxfk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/af8mv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/relationships/node/,af8mv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a27c7563e16d1000f02bd9b/,5a27c7563e16d1000f02bd9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmxfk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rmxfk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rmxfk,NA

The push for racial equality in Mississippi education faced strict opposition by Whites following the Brown (1954) court ruling. Over time, this resistance led to resegregated school systems in which whites fled to private schools and public schools became majority Black.

The effects of these negative experiences are known. They can lead to depression, suicidal ideation, lowered earning potential, and a range of other negative outcomes. Also known are the effects of diversity on a college campus. These outcomes are positive for all members of the campus community. This is why it is incumbent on universities to provide safe, inclusive, and diverse campus communities.
The present results make clear that LGBTQ students at USM do not find themselves subject to a supportive and inclusive environment. They are almost twice as likely to become the victim of assault or harassment on campus as their counterparts. They report hearing negative comments from staff, administrators, and other students more often than their counterparts. They witness threatening behavior more often, particularly with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity. That experience isn’t unique to LGBTQ students, though. Across all students sampled, 1 in 5 report witnessing threatening behavior on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity at least somewhat often on the USM campus. Although nearly 4 in 10 students surveyed agreed that a diverse and inclusive campus environment was a factor in deciding which college to attend, LGBTQ students surveyed were less likely to find the USM campus inclusive and committed to diversity.
These results present a clear picture of a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to serve the university’s LGBTQ students and create an inclusive campus environment despite budget shortfalls and a difficult political/cultural environment in Mississippi for LGBTQ issues. The opportunity is that there is already much work going on at USM to create just such an environment, and that diversity and inclusion may lead to increases in recruitment and retention, particularly among LGBTQ students.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.864838,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T18:03:17.654985,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,Research Initiative on Social Justice and Equity,2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/citation/,wujkn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j8whb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/relationships/node/,j8whb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d46b86b219000f8aed45/,5a26d46b86b219000f8aed45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wujkn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wujkn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wujkn,NA

They report experiencing discrimination, harassment, assault, and negative experiences with public official, among others. These experiences with bias and discrimination begin early on, with pervasive issues in the K-12 schooling system, and continue through college and university settings. In adult life, LGBT Mississippians experience workplace bias and discrimination, medical stigma, difficulty accessing medical care, and public bias and harassment. All of these experiences take a toll, resulting in a number of negative outcomes. These include depression, suicidal thoughts, lowered academic outcomes, lowered ability to perform at the job, and lower overall physical health. However, these experiences can be lessened and negative effects mitigated.
Diversity resolutions, nondiscrimination policies, and nondiscrimination ordinances make a real and positive difference in the lives of LGBT people. They provide affirming messages, decrease the perception that anti-LGBT discrimination and bias is officially sanctioned, and provide a sense of social support. All of these factors combine to result in better outcomes for LGBT people, and for the communities in which they live.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.793480,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:59:42.831378,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Research Initiative on Social Justice and Equity,2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/citation/,exrju,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j3wfn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/relationships/node/,j3wfn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d367b42121000d163240/,5a26d367b42121000d163240,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exrju/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exrju/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exrju,NA

Data were collected from 161 SANE nurses from 23 SANE organizations across the central and west United States through standardized tools and a demographic questionnaire. Both personality, namely agreeableness, and workplace characteristics, particularly perceived empowerment and job satisfaction, combine to predict intention to leave the job of these sampled SANE nurses. One particularly curious finding is the positive prediction of agreeableness on turnover intention – that is, the more agreeable people would be more likely to leave their jobs as SANE nurses. Professionals can gain insight from the path analysis results that show the need to address both personal and organizational factors in mitigating turnover intention among SANE nurses. This appears to be particularly true in providing a sense of empowerment and opportunity within the organization.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.759518,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:47:05.341696,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts,Journal of Forensic Nursing,2012,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/citation/,ckw7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4mk9p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/relationships/node/,4mk9p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d2e2b42121000d1631cf/,5a26d2e2b42121000d1631cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckw7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ckw7g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ckw7g,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-3938.2012.01141.x
