Beyond being an attribute of individual women, education is also an aggregate phenomenon: the social meaning of a woman’s educational attainment depends on the educational attainments of her agemates. Using data from 30 countries and 246 birth cohorts across sub-Saharan Africa, we investigate the impact of educational context (the percent of women in a country cohort who ever attended school) on the relationship between a woman’s own educational attainment and her marital timing. In contexts where access to education is prevalent, the marital timing of uneducated and highly-educated women is more similar than it is in contexts where attending school is limited to a privileged minority. This across-country convergence is driven by no-education women marrying later in high-education contexts, especially through lower rates of very early marriages. However, within countries over time, the marital ages of women from different educational groups tend to diverge as educational access expands. This within-country divergence is most often driven by later marriage among highly-educated women, although some countries’ divergence is driven by earlier marriage among women who never attended school.",TRUE,FALSE,africa|education|marriage,2018-07-04T16:29:44.709607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T16:28:59.682101,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/citation/,78fra,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p5dsx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/relationships/node/,p5dsx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3c7d4a166089000d6aea09/,5b3c7d4a166089000d6aea09,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/78fra/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/78fra,NA

This question is particularly salient in developing countries, where more of the world’s population growth is occurring and where urbanization trends are the fastest. This study revisits the issue of the driving mechanism for urban growth, aiming to assess the relative contribution of natural increase and rural to urban migration. This issue has been considered in two prior publications of the United Nations. The first provided both a broader discussion of urban and rural population growth more generally, as well as a presentation of the method for studying the components of urban growth using the Census Survival Ratio Method (United Nations 1980). The second report continued the analysis on the components to urban growth with the same basic methodology and using updated data from a larger number of countries (United Nations 2001). The current study greatly expands the empirical range by including data on 248 censuses from 76 countries. We focus attention on certain specific assumptions underlying the methodology. In particular, we examine the methodological limitations to help to understand the extent to which the overall assessment of the components of growth may (or may not) be affected by these assumptions. These additional analyses provide further insight into the sensitivity of estimates of the components of urban growth.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|developing countries|Migration|natural increase|Urban,2018-07-04T01:14:01.672017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T01:13:40.875406,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Guy Stecklov,2008,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/citation/,4zk5b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6e9hx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/relationships/node/,6e9hx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3c1286166089000d6aa7f9/,5b3c1286166089000d6aa7f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4zk5b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4zk5b,NA

However, a form of information seems still underestimated, perhaps precisely because it is so pervasive that we take it for granted: the information encoded in the very environment we live in. We still do not fully understand how information takes the form of cities, and how our minds deal with it in order to learn about the world, make daily decisions, and take part in the complex system of interactions we create as we live together. This paper addresses three related problems that need to be solved if we are to understand the role of environmental information: (1) the physical problem: how can we preserve information in the built environment? (2) The semantic problem: how do we make environmental information meaningful? and (3) the pragmatic problem: how do we use environmental information in our daily lives? Attempting to devise a solution to these problems, we introduce a three-layered model of information in cities, namely environmental information in physical space, environmental information in semantic space, and the information enacted by interacting agents. We propose forms of estimating entropy in these different layers, and apply these measures to emblematic urban cases and simulated scenarios. Our results suggest that ordered spatial structures and diverse land use patterns encode information, and that aspects of physical and semantic information affect coordination in interaction systems.",TRUE,FALSE,cities|entropy|environment|information|interaction|social action,2018-07-04T16:27:46.033439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T16:27:01.356535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/citation/,jgz5d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gcfxb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/relationships/node/,gcfxb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3a832200a08e000cd5edff/,5b3a832200a08e000cd5edff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jgz5d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jgz5d,NA

This infusion of military weapons and tactics along the border and within America’s urban core produces devastating effects on communities of color. Yet, to date, few critical race scholars attend to the Wars on Terror and on Drugs as two sides of the same coin. This paper serves as a bridge between U.S.-Mexico border studies and critical race studies vis-à-vis a theorization of a thickening military-police assemblage birthed by the War on Drugs, and intensified by the War on Terror. To delineate this assemblage, we respond to two key questions: how and to what degree has the U.S.-Mexico border served as a staging-ground for US (para)military and surveillance strategies at home and abroad? And how do discourses on America’s urban core compare and contrast with those on its southern border? We draw upon the cases of Esequiel Hernández, Jr. and Michael Brown, two teenagers whose lives were taken by this assemblage, to frame these questions.

Building on Mills’s “vocabularies of motive” concept, I theorize that Americans who are more religious or affiliated with a conservative Protestant tradition will be more likely to emphasize their former-spouse’s role in the divorce while minimizing their own. Data are taken from a large, representative sample of divorced Americans in the 2014 Relationships in America survey. Analyses affirm that divorced Americans who attend worship services more frequently are more likely to say that their former-spouse wanted the divorce more than they did. Looking at 17 specific reasons for divorce, those who feel religion is more important to them are consistently more likely to select reasons that put blame on their former-spouse or circumstances, while frequent attendees are less likely to cite their own behaviors or intentions. Though less consistent, notable patterns emerged for conservative Protestants as well.

The idea is that by shifting from the production of goods to the provision of services, a society can reduce its material demands. But do societies with a larger service sector actually dematerialize? 	I test the `dematerialization through services' hypothesis with a focus on fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions --- the primary drivers of climate change. I find no evidence that a service transition leads to carbon dematerialization. Instead, a larger service sector is associated with greater use of fossil fuels and greater carbon emissions per person.

In this article, I argue that these studies tend to overemphasize statistical significance and often neglect to assess the explanatory or predictive power of their theories. To illustrate the problem, I estimate variations of a statistical model published in an influential article on “Political Risk, Institutions, and FDI.” I find that none of the political variables that the authors consider accounts for much of the variation in aggregate FDI inflows. To ensure that this underwhelming result is not driven by misspecification or measurement error, I leverage a large firm-level data set on the investment location decisions of thousands of multinational firms. Using nonparametric machine-learning techniques and out-of-sample tests, I show that gravity variables can help us develop very accurate expectations about firm behavior but that none of the 31 “political determinants” of FDI that I consider can do much to improve our expectations. These findings have important implications because they suggest that governments retain some room to move in the face of economic globalization.",TRUE,FALSE,foreign direct investment|international political economy|political economy,2018-07-03T15:24:41.128776,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-03T15:20:28.613612,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/citation/,vydsh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jzgxe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/relationships/node/,jzgxe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3b73f0ab16ae0010b92c6f/,5b3b73f0ab16ae0010b92c6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vydsh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vydsh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vydsh,https://doi.org/10.1080/03050629.2016.1185011

China is both an increasingly unequal and rapidly ageing country. Understanding how the relationships that Older Chinese have with their children are associated with social inequalities, is therefore of paramount importance. We do this by examining the effect of socio-economic indicators of the parent and child on their relationship in a multilevel, multinomial logit model of parent-child dyads using data from the Chinese Family Panel Study. First, the relationships we observe are not unidimensional and display complex patterns which deviate heavily from a ‘strong versus weak’ description of family ties. The results do not support a family displacement perspective of parent-child relationships but instead suggest that educational and financial resources facilitate support that is associated with greater emotional closeness and negates the need for support which places an emotional strain on the parent-child relationship.",TRUE,FALSE,China|Inequality|Intergenerational Support|Latent Class Analysis,2018-07-03T15:29:02.667477,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-03T15:23:28.901386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/citation/,f35nh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cq3u5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/relationships/node/,cq3u5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3b6a92fc7cf4000f3ac55b/,5b3b6a92fc7cf4000f3ac55b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f35nh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f35nh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f35nh,NA

We illustrate this collaborative process through a case study of Hemlock Hospice, a 3000-meter-long art-based, site-specific interpretive trail at Harvard University’s Harvard Forest. At one level, Hemlock Hospice describes the ongoing demise of the eastern hemlock tree caused by a tiny aphid-like insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid. More broadly, Hemlock Hospice addresses issues of climate change, human impact, and the future of the world’s forests. This case study highlights gains realized from embedding artists and designers in an active scientific research site while specifically including scientists as full partners in designing and producing mission-driven educational artwork. It also illuminates challenges of democratizing art/science collaborations, including different modes of communication among participants; appropriate levels of financial support; different measures of scientific and artistic success; and creating opportunities for direct action.",TRUE,FALSE,direct action|ecological art|environmental art|forest ecology|Hospice care,2018-07-03T15:27:21.349613,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-03T15:22:49.796225,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d3a|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|Interdisciplinary Arts and Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/citation/,tw5ga,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vcj5n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/relationships/node/,vcj5n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3b6828ab16ae000db95394/,5b3b6828ab16ae000db95394,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tw5ga/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tw5ga/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tw5ga,NA
