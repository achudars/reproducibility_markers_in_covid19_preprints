Using an event history approach, this study analyzes earnings instability—measured by one-time wage shocks, cumulative wage shocks, and stable earnings duration—on child maltreatment risk. It also pays attention to the role of safety net programs on buffering the risk of adverse wage shocks on child welfare involvement. I find that experiencing a negative earnings shock of 30% or more increases the likelihood of CPS involvement by approximately 18%. The effect diminishes and becomes nonsignificant when an earnings decline is compensated by benefit receipt. Each additional earnings drop is associated with a 15% greater likelihood of CPS involvement. Each consecutive quarter with stable income is associated with 5% lower probability of a CPS report. The results are more pronounced for abuse than neglect and are marginally significant for neglect reports. The findings suggest that accessing sufficient social benefits as supplemental income when negative earnings shocks occur serves to effectively buffer against the risk of child maltreatment, particularly among families with young children. This study confirms income support as an important instrument to reduce child maltreatment risk; it indicates that policies aimed at boosting income and stabilizing low-income family economics could substantially increase children’s safety and well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,child welfare involvement|earnings instability|employment instability|income supplement|social policy,2021-04-15T17:01:25.335599,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15T14:55:13.136970,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare",Julie Y.

explain how publishers transfer the symbolic capital of an already prestigious 
journal to derivative journals that share in the prestige of the original brand and 
transform it into new economic capital. As shown by their high impact factors, 
these newly created journals benefit from the name recognition and reputation 
of the originals after which they are named. Plus, through a manuscript routing 
mechanism, the publishers recycle some of the submissions rejected by their highly 
selective flagship journal by redirecting those manuscripts, along with their re?views, to derivative journals or to one of the lower-impact journals on their list,

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic was a truly exogenous shock that hit couples unexpectedly. This study examines the role of gender ideologies in how couples adjusted their division of housework during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to a pre-pandemic baseline observation. The data cover 3,219 couples from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, with a baseline wave and four COVID-19 panel waves between April and September 2020. We found no evidence that individuals’ or couples’ pre-crisis gender role attitudes affected changes in men's and women's absolute or relative contributions to housework at any time during the lockdown. However, both partners spent substantially more time on housework throughout the COVID-19 crisis than before, especially in the early stages, and in relative terms, the pandemic seems to have contributed to at least a temporary, modest increase in gender equality in housework. We discuss our results against the background of previous research whose results may have suffered from endogeneity problems and argue that the COVID-19 ‘shock’ was likely perceived as a merely temporary disruption of couples' established housework arrangements.",TRUE,FALSE,Corona|COVID-19|Gender ideology|Gender inequality|Gender relations|Gender role attitudes|Sociology|Understanding society,2021-04-15T09:35:03.310216,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15T08:53:01.163245,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/citation/,dm2ae,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wz86q/,wz86q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6077f510c29ca80068eb1cf2/,6077f510c29ca80068eb1cf2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dm2ae/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dm2ae,NA

It combines hunting animals, fishing and foraging for wild foods and nutrients and mobility as a sustenance mechanism. During colonial times, there can be seen a trend of undermining hunter-gatherer’s identity, culture, belief, worldview, practices by implementing various policies e.g. capitalisation of nature as a natural resource, displacement led development, etc. It has not only marginalised the hunter-gatherer community socially, culturally, economically and politically but also affected their health adversely. It has been observed worldwide that the post-colonial government has not only renewed colonial marginalisation politics and policies but also legalised it in the name of development, service, national obligation, legislation, institution, nationalism, civic responsibility, citizenship, and morality. This act of local government has been described as civic-colonisation. The civic-colonial policies and politics have used the western capitalist framework, technology-led development in the livestock area, politics of nomenclature etc. as a roadmap for the politics of reconciliation. These policies and politics have categorised the hunter-gatherer as an ethnic minority and cost their land, culture, health and identity.

Recent studies in the field have leveraged supervised machine learning techniques to automate the labeling process of electoral programs, debate motions, and other relevant documents. We build on current approaches to label shorter texts and phrases in party manifestos using a pre-existing coding scheme developed by political scientists for classifying texts by policy domain and policy preference. Using labels and data compiled by the Manifesto Project, we make use of the state-of-the-art Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to seek out the best model architecture for policy domain and policy preference classification.

This association, known as the ""marriage premium,"" has been interpreted as emerging from the selectivity of parents who marry and from a positive effect of marriage. The authors suggest that the positive effect of marriage could be contextual, emerging from the normativity of marriage in society. They test this hypothesis using the case of Chile, where marital fertility dropped sharply from 66% of all births in 1990 to 27% in 2016. The authors find that the benefit of marriage for infant health was large in the early 1990s but declined as marital fertility became less normative in society, to fully disappear in 2016. Multivariate analysis of temporal variation, multilevel models of variation across place, sibling ?fixed effects models, and a falsification test consistently indicate that marriage has a beneficial effect when marital fertility is normative and a weak effect when is not. Generalizing from this case, the authors discuss contextual effects of diverse practices and statuses.",TRUE,FALSE,Fixed effects|Infant health|Marriage|Non-marital fertility|Normative change|Social Change|Social norms,2021-04-14T23:56:20.934387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-14T17:02:34.088462,FALSE,NA,no,"Restricted-access data can be requested from the Ministry of Health, Chile",,no,No preregistration,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/citation/,e4vnx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9qyax/,9qyax,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60770eb751f7ae0636f51ff7/,60770eb751f7ae0636f51ff7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4vnx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4vnx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4vnx,NA

The subject of this classroom action research was 40 students. The research was a classroom action research which was conducted in two cycles where each cycle consisted of planning, implementation, observation and reflection. The data of this research were obtained from the results of the test and observation sheet, questionnaire, field notes, during the implementation of the action. The findings of the research showed that Alphabetical Cards was effective in improving EFL students’ vocabulary. The effectiveness of Alphabetical Cards was shown by the improvement of students’ score. The findings revealed that in cycle 1 there were 18 students who achieved minimum criteria of achievement. It means that the classical achievement was 45%. In cycle 2, it showed that there were 36 of 40 students who achieved the minimum criteria of achievement. It means that the gain achievement was 90%. Gain achievement is based on the number of students who get the score at least the criteria of success (70). Both of the gained and individual achievements have met the criteria of success. It can be concluded that the alphabetical cards is very effective to improve the students’ vocabulary.",TRUE,FALSE,Alphabetical Cards|EFL students|Vocabulary,2021-04-15T11:42:25.751962,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15T09:27:49.374130,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d52|Education|Language and Literacy Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/citation/,8qrdt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6077060f51f7ae063af50ff7/,6077060f51f7ae063af50ff7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qrdt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8qrdt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8qrdt,NA

When and why they opted for contentious collective actions instead of reluctant acquiescence is still a subject of debate. In this article, I revisit the issue by examining the genesis of a total strike in Madrid Underground in June 2010, which occurred in response to a wage cut applied to this publicly owned enterprise. By drawing upon union communica-tions produced at the time of the events and semi-directive inter-views conducted with union representatives and ordinary workers, I retrace the sequences of interaction between workers, unions, the company management, and the regional government, which even-tually led to the total strike. The ﬁndings reveal that the question of ‘how’ is as important as the ‘why’: the relationship between the wage cut and the strike is in fact anything but direct. Rather, the strike resulted from a largely unintended ‘composition eﬀect’–a combination of nested interactions between multiple and inter-dependent players.",TRUE,FALSE,Austerity|Great Recession|Interactionism|Labor movements|Spain|Strikes,2021-04-15T10:27:22.522866,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15T09:05:12.047808,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Nicholas Pohl,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/citation/,bz34x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60770339f6585f0651611fd2/,60770339f6585f0651611fd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz34x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bz34x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bz34x,https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2019.1708310
