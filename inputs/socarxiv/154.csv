Methods: Using data on monthly count of arrest for controlling or coercive behaviour in 33 police forces, we used a negative binomial difference-in-difference analysis and capitalised on differences in intervention timing to undertake an event study.
Results: Training was associated with a 41% increase in arrest for controlling or coercive behaviour for trained forces compared to untrained forces (IRR 1.413, 95% CI 1.235–1.617). The event study illustrated that the increase in arrests in trained forces was consistent with the timing of the training.
Conclusions: Training entire police forces to understand the dynamics of domestic abuse, including the new offence of coercive control, is effective in increasing the rate of arrest for coercive control.",TRUE,FALSE,coercive control|difference-in-differences|domestic abuse|event study|police training|policing,2020-07-14T07:07:42.202831,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-14T07:05:33.142228,TRUE,"Andy Myhill is a staff member of College of Policing.

We bring together official statistics on the introduction of Universal Credit with data on food bank usage from the UK’s largest food bank network. We test the relationship between Universal Credit and food parcel distribution using a range of causal identification strategies (such as fixed-effects model, Granger causality tests, and matching designs) and consistently find that an increase in the prevalence of Universal Credit is associated with more food parcel distribution. We also find that the relationship between Universal Credit and food parcel distribution is stronger in areas where food banks are active, suggesting food insecurity arising from Universal Credit may be hidden in places where food banks are largely unavailable. Though it is challenging to implement any large-scale change to social security, our analysis suggests systemic and persistent problems with this new system.

The program was developed around two intervention types: i) weekly inquiry sessions about urban mobility through the Philosophy with Children approach and ii) bimonthly outdoor walking activities in the surroundings of schools. In this way, it was possible to observe positive changes in the perceptions of children’s statements and in the social norms of their caregivers about transportation, as well as significant modal shifts of caregivers towards sustainable mobility, which were evaluated using difference-in-differences and time-series analyses. 
Besides the identification of changes in the behavior of adult caregivers through child-centered intervention types, this empirical research enabled unraveling the effect of the proposed measures according to the child’s gender, nationality, and level of social vulnerability, including the significant modal shifts towards walking and cycling identified among boys and out of car and motorcycle among native children, which were significant both in post and follow-up measures.

It also draws attention to the digital world through the lens of contact-tracing apps. Here, we find ourselves examining human-virus-data relations, with species and data meeting and mingling. This article does not study Covid-19 in isolation, but reaches beyond to examine what has led us to this situation and the role data is currently playing. The article offers an answer to the question: How do humans, Covid-19 and Covid-19 contact-tracing apps meet and mingle? This article examines how species meet and mingle, as well as how the Anthropocene has contributed to the current situation. The article also discusses contact-tracing apps and what these apps mean for society. In the final section, the article shows how entanglements are not constrained to those which are multispecies, but also stretch out to the digital. These postdigital hybrid assemblages enable the coming together of humans, biological more than human worlds, and the digital. Hopefully, this discussion about the postdigital hybrid assemblage will contribute to discussions in the future, and long after Covid-19, about how we are living our lives, and who and what we are living our lives with.",TRUE,FALSE,Anthropocene|Contact-tracing Apps|Covid-19|Data|More than Human Worlds|Postdigital Hybrid Assemblage|Species Meeting,2020-07-12T19:44:09.628860,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-12T19:43:40.131481,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology",Dr Catherine Price,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/citation/,fc4sw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0b391a0aa0990090160161/,5f0b391a0aa0990090160161,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc4sw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fc4sw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fc4sw,NA
