In this exploratory study, we examine the composition of self-organized project groups and the structure of collaboration networks at the Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School. Using data from all iterations of the summer school from 2005 to 2019, comprising 824 participants and 321 projects, we investigate the factors that contribute to group composition. We first test for homophily with respect to individual-level attributes, finding that group composition is largely consistent with random mixing based on gender, career position, institutional prestige, and country of study. However, we find some evidence of homophilic preference in group composition based on disciplinary background. We then conduct analyses at the level of group projects, finding that project topics from the Social and Behavioral Sciences are over-represented. This could be due to a higher level of baseline interest in, or knowledge of, social and behavioral sciences, or the common application of methods from the natural sciences to problems in the social sciences. Consequently, future research should explore this discrepancy further and examine whether it can be mitigated through policies aimed at making topics in other disciplines more accessible or appealing for collaboration.",TRUE,FALSE,Complex Systems|Homophily|Interdisciplinary Collaboration|Networks,2020-03-19T16:34:49.172204,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-19T16:34:26.501742,NA,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/fdabl/Analyzing-CSSS,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/citation/,e3z4v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e73965f0cd06c0501002226/,5e73965f0cd06c0501002226,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3z4v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e3z4v/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246260,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e3z4v

Being linguistically and culturally distinct, Hungary is ideally positioned and somewhat unique, being surrounded by seven other nations. In academics, the challenges facing Hungarian scholars are no different than other scholars in the EU, or globally. In the past few years, research ethics has become more stringent, in part as a result of fortified post-publication peer review. This letter provides one perspective about the state of Hungarian research and academia relative to other EU nations through the prism of research ethics, and in the form of literature corrections, including retractions. Using the Retraction Watch database, 24 retractions, corrections or expressions of concern were observed. One third of those emerged from the University of Debrecen. Five of the corrections were in Elsevier journals, followed by four in Springer Nature journals. Compared with the remaining 26 EU nations, excluding the UK (i.e., considering Brexit), Hungary ranks 17th in terms of number of corrections (range: Malta = 2; Germany = 751). These numbers suggest either that research ethics may be more stringent in Hungary, or that the Hungarian  literature has not been sufficiently scrutinized through post-publication peer review.",TRUE,FALSE,errors|fake|integrity|Magyar|publishing|retractions|trust|verification,2020-03-19T16:37:40.810952,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-19T16:37:29.122007,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/citation/,re4ty,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7395d50cd06c04f5002877/,5e7395d50cd06c04f5002877,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re4ty/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/re4ty/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/re4ty

We investigate both ethnic discrimination and social class discrimination by elementary school teachers in Germany. We conceptualize discrimination as causal effects of signals and use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to disentangle ethnic from social class discrimination. In our experiment, we asked randomly sampled elementary school teachers who teach immigrants to evaluate an essay written by a fourth-grader. Employing a 2x2x3 factorial design, we varied essay quality, child's gender, and ethnic and socioeconomic background using names as stimuli. We do not find evidence for discrimination in grading. However, our findings for teachers’ expectations of children's future performance suggest a discriminatory bias along the lines of both ethnicity and social class. The effect is conditional on essay quality---it only holds true for the better essay. We interpret our findings as evidence for models that highlight situational moderators such as the richness of information and ambiguity---e.g., statistical discrimination---but as evidence against simpler models of ingroup-favoritism or outgroup derogation, e.g., social identity theory or taste discrimination.",TRUE,FALSE,DAG|discrimination|education|ethnic inequality|experiment|experimental research|Germany|social inequality|teachers,2020-03-19T16:34:22.376881,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-19T16:34:02.016425,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/citation/,3g4hb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/43exq/,43exq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e737a2d0cd06c04e60023d4/,5e737a2d0cd06c04e60023d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3g4hb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3g4hb/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2019.100461,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3g4hb

We show that Christian nationalism—meaning the desire to see particularistic and exclusivist versions of Christian symbols, values, and policies enshrined as the established religion of the United States—is a strong and consistent predictor of Americans’ attitudes about science above and beyond other religious and political characteristics. Further, a majority of the overall effect of political ideology on skepticism about the moral authority of science is mediated through Christian nationalism, indicating that political conservatives are more likely to be concerned with particular aspects of science primarily because they are more likely to be Christian nationalists. Likewise, substantial proportions of the well-documented associations between religiosity and biblical “literalism” with views of science are mediated through Christian nationalism.

First, using novel data on technological patents, we find that emigration led to an increase in innovative activity in sending municipalities.  Moreover, the increase in innovation is coupled with an increased adoption of new technologies in both the agricultural and industrial sectors.

However, the pathway from research to policy impact is rarely linear, with impact often resulting from the interrelationships of many factors. Attributing a change in policy to research activities is therefore not straightforward, especially if, like RESAS, one wants to evaluate impact in a short timeframe after a piece of research is completed. Therefore, this study aims to scope for an appropriate evaluation framework to assess the anticipated policy impact of research outputs generated by RESAS’ research providers. It intends to provide researchers with timely information on the expected contribution of their outputs to policymaking and the extent to which these contributions are likely to be realised: its main purposes are therefore learning and improvement. The framework was developed based on practices in Scottish Centres of Expertise and other organisations globally, as well as on current knowledge regarding the contribution of research to policy. Factors influencing the likelihood of research utilisation in policymaking were identified across the formulation, production and dissemination phases of research. The author is proposing a framework – termed Single-Product Evaluation for Immediate DeliverY (SPEIDY) – which assesses these factors in order to provide a picture of the likelihood of research use, and which allows to characterise this use along four categories: conceptual, instrumental, political and/or imposed. The evaluation relies on a survey collecting feedback from the policymaking team, which takes less than four minutes to complete and occurs at the time of final validation of the output.

However, as of 4 April 2020, in comparison to attempts to containing the disease around the world, responses from Vietnam are seen as prompt and effective in protecting the interests of its citizens, with 239 confirmed cases and no fatalities. This study analyzes the situation in terms of Vietnam’s policy response, social media and science journalism. A self-made web crawl engine was used to scan and collect official media news related to COVID-19 between the beginning of January and April 4, yielding a comprehensive dataset of 14,952 news items. The findings shed light on how Vietnam—despite being under-resourced—has demonstrated political readiness to combat the emerging pandemic since the earliest days. Timely communication on any developments of the outbreak from the government and the media, combined with up-to-date research on the new virus by the Vietnamese science community, have altogether provided reliable sources of information. By emphasizing the need for immediate and genuine cooperation between government, civil society and private individuals, the case study offers valuable lessons for other nations concerning not only the concurrent fight against the COVID-19 pandemic but also the overall responses to a public health crisis.",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|pandemic|policy response|public health system|science journalism|social media|Vietnam,2020-03-18T04:04:00.924791,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-18T04:03:49.366444,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dee|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Emergency and Disaster Management|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/citation/,cfw8x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4w9ef/,4w9ef,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7187e20cd06c04470038ee/,5e7187e20cd06c04470038ee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfw8x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfw8x/,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12072931,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfw8x

We argue that this is indeed the case, and that this disruption will affect the growth of Airbnb on the long term. The first premise of our prediction is that coronavirus is representative of any kind of major shock that has the potential to affect the tourism industry. The second premise is that the consequences of this super-shock are asymmetric. Different types of hosts will face different types of challenges as a consequence of the sudden and unexpected drop in demand. Investors who are in the business of short term rental to make commercial profits will find themselves in a situation where they still have expenses, but no more income. Some of these investors will re-assess the risk of short-term rental and never return to Airbnb.

Judd's theorem (1985) that a zero capital income tax rate is optimal for workers is based on the assumption that all capital has the effect of increasing the marginal productivity of labor. However, in reality, some capital lowers the marginal productivity of labor through automation (technological unemployment). Therefore, this model assumes two types of capital. Labor-complementing capital increases the marginal productivity of labor (real wages), while labor-substituting capital decreases it. The rates of return are kept equal between the two. Using such an economic growth model, we analyze the long-run effects of taxes on real wages. Even if capital income tax is imposed, real wages don’t change because both labor-complementing capital and labor-substituting capital decrease. In contrast, value-added tax results in reduced real wages. This is because labor costs are deducted in capital income tax, but not in value-added tax. Capital income tax is more suitable for income redistribution than value-added tax. These conclusions also apply to an open economy.",TRUE,FALSE,Acemoglu|automation|income redistribution|Judd|open economy|optimal capital income taxation|real wage|tax incidence|technological unemployment|value-added tax,2020-03-19T13:01:20.732990,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-19T13:01:04.329086,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/citation/,fpdnu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e70fbc04a60a50434bb2981/,5e70fbc04a60a50434bb2981,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fpdnu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fpdnu
