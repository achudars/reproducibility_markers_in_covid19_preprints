Assessment and recognition in academic recruitment,"How do academics become professors? This paper considers the making of ‘professor’ as a subject position through which academics are acknowledged in both organizational contexts and disciplinary fields. The paper examines social processes of recognition in 145 appointment procedures for professorships in the discipline of history at sixteen German universities between 1950 and 1985. Based on an analysis of over 1500 documents from archived appointment records, I investigate how academics are acknowledged as professorial in appointment procedures. The procedures invoked both (1) processes of judgement, in which worth and qualities are attributed to candidates, and (2) processes of legitimation, in which said judgements are stabilized and made acceptable. Using insights from the sociology of valuation and evaluation, this paper sheds light on the fundamental processes of recognition and valorization in academia. The findings contribute to the sociology of scientific knowledge and science and technology studies, which have concentrated on academic recognition in the realm of research, but paid less attention to such recognition in organizational contexts. Complementing this literature, the paper allows for a more general understanding of ‘professor’ as a focal academic subject position.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Careers|Evaluation|Judgement|Legitimation|Positioning|Professors|Recognition,2019-09-27T15:49:50.227903,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T15:49:04.751040,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/citation/,7jf2a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8e2618c43280001ac475f4/,5d8e2618c43280001ac475f4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jf2a/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312719880017,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jf2a

But how exactly are such evaluative judgments formed? What are the underlying psychological processes of media entertainment evaluations? And why do we sometimes feel that the heart and mind are in conflict about those evaluations? To cover the whole complexity of individual media entertainment ratings, we apply the associative–propositional evaluation (APE) model (Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006a, 2011) to the case of movie evaluation processes before, during and after exposure. After defining evaluation and introducing the APE model, we discuss its theoretical and methodological implications for movies and entertainment research.

However, the majority of initiatives for integrated computing education have focused on K-12 settings, as has most education research around computational thinking. At the postsecondary level, computing education remains largely siloed within specific programming courses and has not been well-integrated throughout the STEM curriculum. Current instructional approaches often leave students poorly prepared to transfer their computing knowledge to solve new real-world problems. Additionally, there is limited education research into how best to develop computational thinking among postsecondary students. In fact, education research into computational thinking remains undertheorized and is often definitional in nature.  Here, we integrate computational thinking with the educational psychology concept of adaptive expertise. Finally, we contextualize computational thinking within constructivist learning theories by introducing computational apprenticeship, an application of cognitive apprenticeship to computing.

This means cross-cutting exposure that challenges these misperceptions can improve assessments of out-party media. To support this argument, we use survey-linked web browsing data to show the public has hostile views of out-party news sources they rarely encounter. We conduct three survey experiments that demonstrate cross-cutting exposure to non-political or neutral political coverage – forms of news widely available from partisan sources online – reduces oppositional media hostility. These findings explain how perceptions of rampant bias from out-party media coexist with modest differences in the online content major partisan news outlets provide.

Research performance assessment in the United Kingdom,"The production of research elites yields non-intended stratification effects. The contribution illustrates this by drawing on the British Research Assessment Exercise/Research Excellence Framework. Building on data from the three most recent assessments (RAE 2001, RAE 2008, REF 2014), a field and capital theoretical framework examines the unequal distribution of symbolic, social, and economic resources via panel membership, research staff, and research funding. The distribution of these resources is correlated to RAE/REF rank groups. The contribution concludes that the elite (re )produced by research performance assessments in Britain is not (solely) based on “research excellence”, but on previous allocations of symbolic, social, and economic resources.",TRUE,FALSE,Bourdieu|Elites|Higher Education|Performance Assessment|Rankings|Research Excellence Framework|Stratification|Universities,2019-09-27T17:20:02.458094,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T17:19:40.923653,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/citation/,3dxn8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8cdec0d55120001b5a446f/,5d8cdec0d55120001b5a446f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3dxn8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3dxn8/,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53970-6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3dxn8

It distinguishes literature on standardization effects and on stratification effects. The main section of the paper presents different rankings that are produced from the data of the Research Assessment Exercise and the Research Excellence Framework in the UK. Among them are rankings produced directly by the RAE/REF, and rankings produced by media outlets drawing on the RAE/REF data. Informed by these case examples, the closing section discusses the performativity of rankings. It looks into the different implications and effects rankings and the associated performance assessments have on higher education institutions, their personnel, and the personnel's practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Devices|Governance|Higher Education|Performativity|Rankings|Research Assessment Exercise|Research Excellence Framework,2019-09-27T15:51:47.660803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T15:51:32.633000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/citation/,6ca2q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8cdacc4ab86b0019f13c5d/,5d8cdacc4ab86b0019f13c5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ca2q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ca2q/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ca2q
