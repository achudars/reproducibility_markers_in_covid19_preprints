It considers the thermostatic and the increasing returns perspectives as pointing toward a potentially stable set of effects running between opinion and policy. Both theoretical perspectives argue that opinion and policy are reciprocally causal, feeding back on one another. This is a general argument found in opinion-policy literatures. However, much empirical research claims to model “feedback” effects when actually using separate unidirectional models of opinion and policy. Only a small body of research addresses opinion-policy endogeneity directly. In this paper I consider an opinion-policy system with simultaneous feedback and without lags. I argue that there is a theoretical equilibrium in the relationship of opinion and policy underlying the otherwise cyclical processes that link them. Given that available cross-national data are cross-sectional and provide limited degrees of freedom, an ideal theoretical model must be somewhat constrained in order to arrive at empirically meaningful results. In this challenging and exploratory undertaking I hope to open up the possibility of a general system of effects between public opinion and social policy and how to model them in future research. I focus on social welfare policy as it is highly salient to public interests and a costly area of government budgets, making it an area of contentious policymaking. Social policy is also a major part of the thermostatic model of opinion and policy, which was recently extended to the cross-national comparative context (Wlezien &amp; Soroka, 2012) providing a critical predecessor to this paper because identification of equilibrium between public opinion and social policy in any given society is greatly enhanced through comparison with other societies. This counterfactual approach helps to identify opinion-policy patterns that may not change much within societies, but can be seen as taking on discrete trajectories between societies.",TRUE,FALSE,decommodification|positive returns|public opinion|simultaneous feedback|social policy preferences|social welfare|welfare state,2018-07-02T13:32:13.359152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-30T11:27:28.481544,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/citation/,wt376,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpfrd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/relationships/node/,tpfrd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abe075da2409b000ea09062/,5abe075da2409b000ea09062,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wt376/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wt376/,https://doi.org/10.1111/psj.12171,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wt376

Existing literature often understands cultural diversity as presenting a trade-off between task coordination and creative problem-solving. This work assumes that diversity arises primarily through cultural differences between individuals. In contrast, we propose that diversity can also exist within persons such that cultural heterogeneity can be unpacked into two distinct forms: interpersonal and intrapersonal. We argue that the former tends to undermine coordination and portends worsening firm profitability, while the latter facilitates creativity and supports greater patenting success and more positive market valuations. To evaluate these propositions, we use unsupervised learning to identify cultural content in employee reviews of nearly 500 publicly traded firms on a leading company review website and then develop novel, time-varying measures of cultural heterogeneity. Our empirical results lend support for our two core propositions, demonstrating that a diversity of cultural beliefs in an organization does not necessarily impose a trade-off between operational efficiency and creativity.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|diversity|innovation|organizations|performance,2018-07-02T13:32:13.282391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-30T11:26:45.069408,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/citation/,3trn7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b67v4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/relationships/node/,b67v4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abdb7e2a2409b000ea03b8d/,5abdb7e2a2409b000ea03b8d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3trn7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3trn7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3trn7

A Cross-National Examination,"Women are typically more liberal than men. But on some issues related to “traditional moral values”—including sexuality and the beginning and end of life—women are just as if not more conservative than men. This study examines the role of religion in complicating the relationship between gender and values cross-nationally, with particular attention to variation across religious groups and contexts. Using data from a diverse set of 56 countries in the World Values Survey (N=85,181), I find that religiousness suppresses what would otherwise be larger and more consistent gender differences in values among Christians. Among most other groups, including Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, and Muslims in non-Muslim contexts, religiousness does not greatly alter gender differences in values. However, among Muslims in Muslim-majority contexts—where men tend to be more religious than women—religiousness amplifies what would otherwise be smaller gender differences in values. Accordingly, gender differences in values tend to be larger among Muslims than Christians.

Simultaneously, privately owned vehicles are vastly underused, wasting valuable opportunities for accommodating more people in a livable urban environment by occupying spacious parking areas. Since a data-driven quantification and visualization of such urban mobility space inequality is lacking, here we explore how crowdsourced data can help to advance its understanding. In particular, we describe how the open-source online platform What the Street!? uses massive user-generated data from OpenStreetMap for the interactive exploration of city-wide mobility spaces. Using polygon packing and graph algorithms, the platform rearranges all parking and mobility spaces of cars, rails, and bicycles of a city to be directly comparable, making mobility space inequality accessible to a broad public. This crowdsourced method confirms a prevalent imbalance between modal share and space allocation in 23 cities worldwide, typically discriminating bicycles. Analyzing the guesses of the platform’s visitors about mobility space distributions, we find that this discrimination is consistently underestimated in the public opinion. Finally, we discuss a visualized scenario in which extensive parking areas are regained through fleets of shared, autonomous vehicles. We outline how such accessible visualization platforms can facilitate urban planners and policy makers to reclaim road and parking space for pushing forward sustainable transport solutions.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|bin packing|crowdsourcing|data visualization|mobility|OpenStreetMap|sustainable transport|transport justice|urban space inventory|volunteered geographical information,2018-07-02T13:32:12.998902,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T20:25:47.766292,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/citation/,je5r4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kfv3w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/relationships/node/,kfv3w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abd3dc2a2409b00109ea278/,5abd3dc2a2409b00109ea278,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je5r4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/je5r4/,https://doi.org/10.17645/up.v3i1.1209,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/je5r4

More specifically, critical discourse analysis may uncover her mental representations about the Tunisian Revolution and the US attitude towards such an important political event in North Africa and the Middle East. Studying factive presupposition and epistemic modality seems to be an effective pragmatic tool to reveal what is presented as factual and ideological knowledge in political discourse. The research instrument used to work out the frequency distribution of these lexical features is the latest version of ‘AntConc’ software. To uncover the epistemic state of Hillary Clinton, van Dijk’s (1995b) socio-cognitive approach, mainly discourse-cognition-society paradigm, is applied to analyze her speeches between January 2011 and December 2012. At the discourse level, research findings reveal that factive presupposition, epistemic modality and evidential verbs unveil the speaker’s strong personal commitment to the truth value of her propositions. At the cognitive level, results show that the speaker’s personal and social values, attitudes, ideologies and knowledge unmask her mental mapping of Tunisia, democracy and human rights. It also uncovers the cognitive mechanisms that govern discourse production and understanding via ICMs, cognitive frames, mental models and context models. At the social level, research demonstrates that Clinton's perceptual and conceptual worlds are based on a dichotomy that involves 'WE', or democracies Vs. 'THEY' or the enemies of democracy, hence a dual vision of the world or polarization.

This study included both of the quantitative and the qualitative data sets to further the information. The participants of this study were 108 Arab students from nine different Asian and African nationalities. Based on the results of this study, English language was the main means of education for the participants, and the main means of their communication with students from other cultures. The results from this study found some significant correlations between the attributes of ELP and ICCC. The good levels of ELP encouraged and enabled individuals to be involved in daily interactions with their peers from different countries who speak different languages, and their interactions helped them to improve the levels of their ELP. Moreover, the participants who obtained higher scores in English language proficiency test got higher mean scores in ICCC as well. Based on the results, in some cases, their personal characteristics and the low levels of their ELP had negative effects on the process of interactions among Arab and other students. The results of this study may add some interesting information in the literature regarding the relationships between ELP and ICCC of Arab students in an Asian multicultural collegiate environment.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab students|English language proficiency|intercultural communication competence|interpersonal communication competence,2018-07-02T13:32:11.918433,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:39:16.445646,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/citation/,shk6z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/89w46/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/relationships/node/,89w46,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc5a28266c2a000dc11e4e/,5abc5a28266c2a000dc11e4e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shk6z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/shk6z/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.29,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/shk6z

Vocabulary learning verifies to play an important role in oral communication. However, literature lacks the studies where both English as a foreign language (EFL) students and teachers’ views are obtained to provide analyses of the situations in which learners are not showing desired results in speaking.  The current study explores the problems of lack of vocabulary that Saudi EFL students face with special focus on their speaking proficiency. It aims to seek EFL teachers’ opinions on the extent to which lack of vocabulary has influence on EFL students’ performance in listening, and conversation classes, and in expressing their ideas and feelings, and especially in speaking skill.  A questionnaire was used for the responses from the students and an interview for the teachers to reveal their perceptions about the vocabulary hindrance in speaking skills. 20 EFL instructors and teachers of Preparatory Year Program (PYP) section of a public university and 110 EFL students participated in this study. The analysis of the data showed that both teachers and learners indicated that lack of vocabulary is one of the major factors in students’ inability to speaking English.  In the current study, among many other suggestions it is proposed that the inclusion of mobile assisted language learning could be useful way of developing vocabulary for spoken proficiency of Saudi EFL learners.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL|speaking vocabulary|spoken proficiency,2018-07-02T13:32:11.880844,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:39:30.904201,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/citation/,68gwj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/34tr8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/relationships/node/,34tr8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc57d7266c2a000dc11c30/,5abc57d7266c2a000dc11c30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68gwj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/68gwj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.28,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/68gwj
