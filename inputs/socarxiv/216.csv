For this purpose, the keywords of all research articles have been collected and edited to conduct a network analysis. The analysis focuses on the reconstruction of the discursive field of political theory. Two central results were identified: First, the keyword network forms an almost completely connected network, which, however, 'frays' at the discursive margins so that sub-discourses emerge. Second, the keywords 'democracy' and 'freedom' are particularly central to the network and form the core of the political theory debate. Nevertheless, discussions on populism and post-structuralist approaches are also found in the network, thus demonstrating the emergence of new concepts and themes. The political theory debate in the ZPTh thus partially exhibits a center-periphery structure and at the same time illustrates a high degree of pluralism in German-based political theory.

This study focuses on a comparison that has, to date, fallen between the separate literatures on these diverging trends – Black and White students whose parents have similarly low, middle, or high incomes (i.e., same-income or race-within-income). To do so, I draw on three nationally representative datasets on ninth or tenth graders, covering the period from 1960 to 2009, all of which contain information on students’ math test scores. I find that math test score disparities between Black and White students with same-income parents are to Blacks’ disadvantage. Although these disparities have decreased since 1960, in 2009, they remain substantively large, statistically significant, and largest between children of the highest income parents. Further, family and school characteristics that scholars commonly use to explain test score disparities by race or by income have accounted for markedly decreasing shares of race-within-income disparities over time. The study integrates the literatures on test score disparities by race and by income with needed attention to race’s historical and continued structural influence, net of parental income, on students’ educational experiences and test score outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,Achievement gaps|Income|Inequality|Intersectionality|Race,2020-07-29T21:44:44.242196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-29T21:44:12.581333,FALSE,NA,no,"Data from Project TALENT and High School and Beyond are publicly available.

There is a debate whether it is due to an unusually high inequality of market (pre-tax-pre- transfer) income or to weak redistribution. In this paper, we look more deeply at market income inequality, focusing on its main component – labor income – across a group of 24 OECD countries. We disaggregate the working-age population into household types, defined by the number and gender of the household’s earners and the partnership and parenting status of its members. We conclude that within-group inequality of labor incomes in the US is, in almost all groups, high by OECD standards. The roots of US inequality exceptionalism are not to be found in an unusual demographic composition, nor in unusually high or low mean incomes of some demographic groups, but in pervasive high inequality within each of these groups.

Using microdata from Norway covering the entire Norwegian population of residents between 2000 and 2015, we introduce four novel findings on this relationship. First, the share of unemployed individuals belonging to the bottom decile of the gross wealth distribution is tenfold larger than the share belonging to the top decile (34% and 3.2%). Second, the former moves in a specular manner to the latter. Third, the negative slope of the wage curve is confirmed. Fourth, the wage-to-unemployment ratio increases monotonically with gross wealth, and decreases monotonically with net wealth for negative values of net wealth.

They are now used in many subfields of geography, and are among the most common ways to measure the world city network, where intercity links are inferred from firm co-location patterns. Bipartite projections are attractive because a network can be indirectly inferred from readily available data. However, spatial bipartite projections are difficult to analyze because the links in these networks are weighted, and larger weights do not necessarily indicate stronger or more important connections. Methods for extracting the backbone of bipartite projections offer a solution by using statistical models for identifying the links that have statistically significant weights.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses, we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health.",TRUE,FALSE,anxiety|depression|Ecosystem services|green-blue infrastructure|nature’s contributions to people,2020-08-04T08:29:41.965074,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-04T08:29:29.028804,FALSE,NA,no,Data used in the study can be shared on request by the corresponding author,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/citation/,gpt3r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yfbsv/,yfbsv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2124ec61875e01cf319c2c/,5f2124ec61875e01cf319c2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpt3r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gpt3r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gpt3r,NA

Providing a holistic picture from the perspective policy and academic perspective, we bring out some key stylized facts. Further, using the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) estimation, we model the transport mode choice for commuting by the workers in the context of rural and urban India, and further extend it based on distinction in motorized and non-motorized transport modes. We find that urbanization level, population size and density along with education attainment and worker’s sex ratio (gender ratio among workers), age (elderly) and land use mix play very important role in regional pattern in transport mode choice for commuting. These results highlight the dire need for proper development of transport infrastructure and understanding its various dimensions from socio-economic, demographic and spatial point of view in the context of developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Commuting|India|Mode Choice|Motorized and Non-Motorized Transport|Transportation,2020-08-03T19:34:20.785196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-03T19:33:56.552481,FALSE,NA,no,Dataset will be made available upon request.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/citation/,qh8m5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4p9us/,4p9us,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2100bb61875e01ce3151ba/,5f2100bb61875e01ce3151ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qh8m5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qh8m5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qh8m5,NA
