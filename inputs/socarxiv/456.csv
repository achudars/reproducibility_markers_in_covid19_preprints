Drawing on interviews and ethnographic observations among a racially and socio-economically diverse sample of Boston-area defendants and among legal officials, the author describes defendants’ differential styles of engagement with lawyers and the court. Whereas defendants who have reason to trust their lawyers often delegate legal authority to them in consequential moments and experience relative ease of court navigation as a result, defendants who have reason to mistrust their lawyers often withdraw from lawyers and seek to acquire their own legal expertise, such as knowledge about criminal law and procedure learned in their communities, in jail, and through observation. Defendants’ assertive use of self-acquired expertise, however, is discouraged by the court system, often drawing punitive responses from legal officials and constraining defendants’ legal choices. Thus, the cultural styles and resources that scholars have shown to benefit the privileged in mainstream institutions such as schools and workplaces have negative repercussions in the criminal courts, often to the detriment of less-advantaged defendants. The author discusses implications for research on criminal court disparities and sociological theory on culture, expertise, and navigation across a range of institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Class|Courts|Criminal Justice|Expertise|Inequality|Institutions|Law|Lawyers|Professions|Race|Trust,2018-10-28T00:21:43.196509,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-28T00:21:27.559993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Matthew Clair,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/citation/,brf3d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eb9n6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/relationships/node/,eb9n6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd36f648b330000192173d1/,5bd36f648b330000192173d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/brf3d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/brf3d,NA

As such, teaching may have contributed to the build-up and maintenance of cultural complexity in human societies. However, teaching is also a strategic and dynamic behavior that likely evolves in response to both the type of knowledge taught and the social context. We explore this possibility through an evolutionary analysis of teaching fidelity, or the fidelity of knowledge transmission during teaching. 

For our analysis we developed two models, a two-trait model and a quantitative trait model to explore how selection on teaching fidelity varies across different types of knowledge. In our two-trait model we use exoteric and esoteric knowledge categories and specify them mathematically to ask how they may affect the evolutionarily-favored level of teaching fidelity. We show that the evolutionarily-stable transmission fidelity by teachers varies widely across knowledge types and depends on the number of students belonging to a teacher. Esoteric knowledge often converges on either very high or very low fidelity teaching practices, although what is taught often follows majority belief. Along exoteric knowledge domains, increasingly high-cost (or less beneficial) behaviors predicts teachers to impart the more benign (or more beneficial) behaviors. Further, when interactions between students are characterized by a social dilemma, increases in the fraction of the student population taught by a single teacher should increase the frequency with which teachers impart the group-beneficial behavior. Our quantitative model replicates many of the insights above, and further shows selection favoring for ""vague"" or low fidelity teaching once broadly distributed payoffs to traits become multi-modal.

Our analysis suggests future empirical work to document the contexts of knowledge exchange and teaching styles in relation to the type of knowledge transmitted. More generally, it suggests more work to understand the evolution of teaching and teaching institutions, as their dynamics and strategic variability may be more profound than previously supposed.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|cultural transmission|evolution of teaching|exoteric-esoteric knowledge|game theory,2018-10-28T00:20:22.967207,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-28T00:20:04.651575,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/citation/,gtpm2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/keztw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/relationships/node/,keztw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd367958b3300001622c6ff/,5bd367958b3300001622c6ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtpm2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gtpm2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gtpm2,NA

Undocumented immigrants in this study recognize the precarity of their legal status, but they sometimes feel their existence off the radar of the U.S. immigration regime promotes their long-term presence in the country. Meanwhile, documented immigrants in this study describe the relative stability of their legal status, but they sometimes view their existence on the radar of the U.S. immigration regime as disadvantageous to their long-term presence in the country. To explain these perspectives, the article develops the concept of “system embeddedness” to denote individuals’ perceived legibility to institutions that maintain formal records. System embeddedness is one mechanism through which perceived visibility to the U.S. immigration regime entails risk, and perceived invisibility safety, for some immigrants. In this way, the punitive character of the U.S. immigration regime can overwhelm its integrative functions, chilling immigrants out of opportunities for material and social well-being through legalization and legal status in ways that likely have intergenerational consequences. More broadly, system embeddedness illuminates how perceived legibility to a record-keeping body combining punitive and integrative goals—even absent punitive experiences with other systems of social control—represents a mechanism of legal stratification for subordinated populations.",TRUE,FALSE,deportation|documented immigrants|immigration law|Latin America|qualitative methods|removal|surveillance|system avoidance|system involvement|undocumented immigrants,2018-10-28T00:19:22.307947,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-28T00:19:11.772110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Other Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Asad L.

Often, scholars focus on how one or two of their socio-demographic traits compare to their participants and how it may influence field dynamics. Research that incorporates an intersectionality perspective, which brings attention to how people’s multiple identities are entwined, also has a long history. Yet, researchers tend to pay less attention to how we strategically draw on our multiple social positions in the course of field work. Drawing on data I have collected over the past several years and extending recent sociological work that goes beyond a reflexive accounting of one or two of researchers’ demographic characteristics, I argue that each researcher has their own ethnographic toolkit from which they strategically draw.

Despite considerable recent qualitative research in management and organizational theory on the role of politics in decision making and managing organizational change, quantitative research in this area has stalled. The reason for the lack of progress is not theoretical, but rather methodological; researchers lack empirical tools for understanding basic processes of coalition formation, evolution, and conflict in organizations. We introduce a novel method for modeling politics in organizations that builds on the model of intra-organizational conflict in March (1962), which we call “subcoalition cluster analysis” (sCCA). The main contribution of sCCA is that it identifies subcoalitions with consistent preferences that are in conflict without placing additional restrictions on the structure of individual preferences. We apply sCCA to two cases, Wikipedia and the Baseball Writers’ Association of America and show how leadership would benefit from conceiving of their membership as competing subcoalitions instead of individuals with idiosyncratic preference disagreement. Finally, we compare the performance of sCCA to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering and demonstrate that sCCA does a better job identifying latent structure in the data when the organization consists of more subcoalitions, when individual preferences are not perfectly aligned with those of their subcoalition, and when observations are missing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-26T01:33:04.354144,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T01:32:48.729481,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,Scott Ganz and Daniel Schiff,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/citation/,5kufg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e4kz5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/relationships/node/,e4kz5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd25528e40bf10018f1609e/,5bd25528e40bf10018f1609e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kufg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kufg,NA

It was a “flood” which was “too vast to be dealt with as a whole,” in the words of the British Quarterly Review in 1859. It remained “a vast wilderness … its extent unknown, its ramifications unfathomed” for subsequent researchers, according to Michael Wolff in a 1971 issue of the Victorian Periodicals Newsletter. By the numbers for newspapers alone, stamped titles increased almost five-fold from 550 in 1846 to 2,440 in 1906. Simon Eliot estimates the number of copies those newspapers rising from 16 million in 1801 to over 78 million by 1849.

The periodical archive has sprawled even more with its gradual digitization which, while representing only a fraction of nineteenth-century print, still astonishes its researchers. “We are now on the brink of a further, exponential expansion … as vast new quantities of hitherto inaccessible records and texts become available for digital searching,” Patrick Leary claimed in 2004.

In this paper, we use the framework of institutional logics as an analytical lens and scheme to understand the fundamental institutional challenges prompted by the advent of the online gig economy. We view gig-economy platforms as corporations that organize and self-regulate markets. In doing so, they span two parallel markets: the market for platforms competing to provide intermediation services and the market for the self-employed competing on platforms to provide peer-to-peer services. Self-regulation by platforms also weakens the traditional roles of the state. While the corporation and market logics empower the platform, they weaken self-employed suppliers as platforms' design constrain suppliers to grow into a fully-fledged business by limiting their entrepreneurial freedom. At the same time, current labor law generally does not classify suppliers as employees of the platform company, which limits the possibility to unionize. The current resolutions to this institutional misalignment are sought in ""band aid solutions"" at the level of sectors. Instead, as we argue, macro-institutional reform may be needed to re-institutionalize gig work into established institutional logics.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-26T01:17:05.970491,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T01:16:46.898127,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Koen Frenken|Taneli Vaskelainen|Lea Fünfschilling|Laura Piscicelli,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/citation/,uqn9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cyz6u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/relationships/node/,cyz6u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd22ee18b330000162101ed/,5bd22ee18b330000162101ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqn9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uqn9v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uqn9v,NA

A distinction between kinds of goods allows sociologists to distinguish education for skills from education for virtues and education for habits. Skills produce external goods while habits and virtues produce internal goods, though in distinct ways, with virtues more related to a specific vision of the good and habits more open to different forms of growth. A distinction between these three forms of practice—skills, habitus, and virtues—can help sociologists recognize and study different forms of goods in schools, better empowering them to examine alienation and the relationship between power and morality.

In particular, what studies have been performed generally rely on the reproduction of aggregate statistics, rather than being based on individual-level data. 
The objective of this study is to (a) identify the extent to which registration is complete in a part of the historical Russian region of Bessarabia for the period 1833-1885 and, then, (b)  identify trends of IMR in a part of the historical Russian region of Bessarabia for the period 1833-1885. The study utilises church records of births (N=21,984) and deaths (N=7,194) from the German colony of Glückstal, a village near modern-day Grigoriopol in Transnistria (Moldova). Three methods of calculating IMR are performed. While there appears to be a significant degree of under-reporting of births which is inconsistent over time as well as gaps in the data more generally, it is possible to account for much of this through adjustment post linkage. After accounting for this, a linked net IMR can be generated. The range over the period is around 100- 190, with some periods of crisis mortality. These figures are lower than has been reported for the region. The comparison of different methods of calculating IMRs suggest that birth registration may be incomplete, however. This means that nominative linkage is required to derive accurate rates and other statistics. The findings challenge the widely held view of very high IMRs across the Russian Empire in the nineteenth century. By utilising appropriate methods, this analysis suggests that such colony church records may represent a valuable source for further analysis of this neglected period in Russian demographic history.",TRUE,FALSE,19th century|infant mortality|Moldova|mortality|population|Russian Empire,2018-10-26T13:15:25.564986,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T13:15:06.868205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/citation/,x6vde,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/64n3c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/relationships/node/,64n3c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd16ce2cce43e001777efb9/,5bd16ce2cce43e001777efb9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6vde/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x6vde/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x6vde,NA

Sustainability research pioneer Donna Meadows has thus called the power to transcend mind sets or paradigms out of which a system arises the most potent leverage point for interventions. One barrier to such interventions is the colonization of the imaginary by capitalism, the root cause of environmental destruction and addiction to economic growth. Latouche argues as part of the debate on degrowth that the colonized Western imaginary must thus be decolonized. In this paper, we ask how this might be achieved and propose (re)introducing human traditions of seeking knowledge that transcend established Western norms and conventions. Drawing upon concrete examples, we describe four types of decolonizers and how they might help decolonize Western imaginaries: 1) Future generations; 2) past generations; 3) non-humans, and 4) spiritual beings and concepts. We conclude by briefly outlining ways to invite these decolonizers of the imaginary individually and institutionally.",TRUE,FALSE,decolonization|degrowth|more-than-human|radical imaginary,2018-10-26T01:36:21.570812,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T01:36:02.652422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/citation/,zq5be,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yj5mf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/relationships/node/,yj5mf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd1234fcce43e001677e47e/,5bd1234fcce43e001677e47e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zq5be/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zq5be/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zq5be,NA
