The translation must take into account the cultural knowledge of the intended reader. This research looks at the relationships between the translator, the author, and the intended and accidental readers of the source text. It discusses the issue of the low status of children’s books, and translated children’s literature in the literary polysystem. It focuses on the resulted disagreement among translators on the appropriate translational procedure to be followed when translating works with culture specific references (foreignization vs. domestication). It is an attempt to draw the attention to the cultural norms which govern the translation of children’s literature from English into Arabic. The research also examines ‘adaptation’ as the most common translational procedure used in translating children’s works with culture specific items and references.

I propose that hierarchical power --- the command of subordinates in a hierarchy --- is what distinguishes the rich from the poor and capitalists from workers. Specifically, I hypothesize that individual income increases with hierarchical power, as does the share of individual income earned from capitalist sources. I test this idea using evidence from US CEOs, as well as a numerical model that extrapolates the CEO data. The results indicate that income tends to increase with hierarchical power, as does the capitalist composition of income.

original survey data from Austria combined with macro-level municipality data,
exploiting quasi-random placement of asylum seekers in municipalities. Drawing
on entropy balancing for causal identification, we find clear evidence of increased
hostility towards asylum seekers in areas that housed them. This may be because
respondents only report superficial contact with asylum seekers. Moreover, general
attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants became less favorable in contexts with
local asylum seeker presence, while vote intention for the main anti-immigration
party increased. These findings go beyond existing work by focusing on citizen attitudes and voting behaviour and by examining contact directly as a mechanism.

transfers of educational advantages and disadvantages trough parental
wealth in Germany, where in contrast to the USA, education at any level is
largely free of tuitions costs. Based on the unique features of wealth and
following the logic of subjective expected utility theory, we propose and, as
one of the very first studies, empirically test two causal mechanisms
underlying the parental wealth-educational decisions relationship:
“disadvantage compensation” and “educational demotivation”. We apply a
multinomial logit model for discrete-time event history analysis, allowing
us to estimate the relative transition risk ratio of children with university
entrance qualification to make the transition from upper secondary school
to 1) higher education, 2) the labor market or vocational training or 3) to
not transition at all. The relative transition risk ratio is measured as a
function of the relative position of the parents in the distribution of net
wealth. Our analyses, based on data from the German Socio-Economic
Panel Study (SOEP), reveal that children with wealthy parents are more
likely to decide for higher education, even if they are faced with low
cognitive abilities (i.e., disadvantage compensation).",TRUE,FALSE,demotivation|intergenerational mobility|parental background|rational choice|SES|SOEP|wealth inequality,2019-04-11T17:10:30.174229,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T17:09:30.888207,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/citation/,c46za,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caedf8139926900180cc910/,5caedf8139926900180cc910,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c46za/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c46za

The connectionist theory of cognition suggests that individuals have mental models composed of associations between concepts. Moreover, structuralist perspectives consider beliefs form an interrelated system. Therefore, the estimation of causal effects of beliefs is undermined by these interdependent relationships of beliefs. This article introduces factorial surveys (FS) as a useful method to solve these potential problems. To demonstrate the appropriateness of this method, this study presents a design and application of FS to a representative sample of Chileans and their beliefs about what determines happiness. The findings provide a folk theory (or a lay theory) of happiness determinants, where health is the most important determinant of happiness, followed by income and lifestyles. In addition, the reliability and cognitive bias of FSs are addressed, finding support for their applicability in developing countries.

How we conceptualize the scientific enterprise shapes how we go about the business of conducting research as well as how we strive to improve scientific practices. In this chapter, I’ll present several models of science. I’ll begin by showing ways in which the classic “hypothesis testing” model of science is misleading, and leads to flawed inferences. As a remedy, I’ll discuss models that treat science as a population process, with important dynamics at the group level that trickle down to the individual practitioners.

The drastic fall in price was from a monthly peak of $112 per barrel (bbl) in June 2014, falling to $62/bbl in December. Since 2016 the oil and gas market has gone through a period of rebalancing, resulting in modest recovery in prices. Oil price recovery reached a peak of $85/bbl in October 2018. Gas prices have also achieved similar modest price recovery. The industry has now entered an expansion phase: the five largest international oil companies exceeded expectations for 2018. The outlook for gas is encouraging. It is projected that gas will supply the largest share of energy demand growth, supplying over 40% of additional demand by 2035.

The paper draws on lines of scholarship in the digital humanities and computational rhetoric – primarily, sequential structuring of semantic contexts, semantic parsing of unstructured text, and diachronic tracking of textual expressions – to extend their conceptual and methodological insights into a computational framework for assessing rhetorical effectiveness. It offers a test case for this concept through an analysis of how Congress has framed human agency toward addressing climate change.",TRUE,FALSE,Computational Rhetoric|Digital Humanities|Rhetoric|Rhetorical Analysis|Rhetorical Effects,2019-04-11T16:55:26.645883,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T16:53:58.979713,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cc6|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cc8|Arts and Humanities|Rhetoric and Composition|Rhetoric|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Speech and Rhetorical Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/citation/,2wjhk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/br84m/,br84m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cae4f7239926900180c2ddd/,5cae4f7239926900180c2ddd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wjhk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2wjhk/,https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2019.1601774,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2wjhk

Using data from 30 European countries, I explore this issue through examining three questions: 1) is class identity associated with highbrow consumption; 2) does this association vary across countries; and 3) is the relationship between class identity and highbrow consumption altered when the majority of people in a given society identify as either ‘working-class’ or ‘middle-class’? After accounting for other socio-demographic controls, people who identify as middle-class are more active highbrow consumers than those who identify as working class. Yet, the distinctiveness of middle-class consumption of highbrow culture varies across countries and is negatively correlated with how many people identify as working-class in a society. As more people identify as working-class (rejecting middle-class identities) highbrow culture less clearly distinguishes middle-class and working-class identifiers. In the absence of any class-structured divisions in highbrow culture, whether and how cultural practices function as a form of cultural capital is likely quite different, reinforcing the claim that the centrality of highbrow culture to cultural capital varies geographically.",TRUE,FALSE,class identity|cultural consumption|highbrow,2019-04-11T16:51:03.770436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T16:50:43.839895,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/citation/,u9dmy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xyqpa/,xyqpa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cae441939926900170bf6cd/,5cae441939926900170bf6cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9dmy/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.04.002,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9dmy
