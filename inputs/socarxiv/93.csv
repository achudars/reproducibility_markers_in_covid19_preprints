Why rule? and how do they respond to states? Many argue that criminal rule provides protection when states do not, and that increasing state services could crowd gangs out. We began by interviewing leaders from 30 criminal groups in Medellín. The conventional view overlooks gangs’ indirect incentives to rule: governing keeps police out and fosters civilian loyalty, protecting other business lines. We present a model of duopolistic competition with returns to loyalty and show under what conditions exogenous changes to state protection causes gangs to change governance levels. We run the first gang-level field experiment, intensifying city governance in select neighborhoods for two years. We see no decrease in gang rule. We also examine a quasi-experiment. New borders in Medellín created discontinuities in access to government services for 30 years. Gangs responded to greater state rule by governing more.

However, a less studied aspect of residential segregation has been how foreign newcomers affect those mobility patterns and consequently residential segregation trends. This paper extends previous investigations by evaluating the effects of newly arrived immigrants on ethnic residential segregation from a dynamic perspective. Unlike previous studies, this study analyzes newcomers' neighborhood choices together with their direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on segregation. Results show that immigrant settlements not only exacerbate residential segregation by landing in already segregated areas (direct effect) but by triggering segregating promoting movements in households living in destination neighborhoods (undirect effect). Both results contribute to producing a higher level of segregation compared with a situation where newcomers would have been randomly allocated across the residential areas (cumulative effect).

It not only explains how the brief formulaic inscriptions found on seals and tablets helped in taxation and trade control, by recording taxed commodity-types, licensed commercial activities, tax-rates, mode of tax-payment, license-issuing entities etc., but also decisively identifies several semasiograms signifying metal-smithy, lapidary-works, related metrology and taxation. It shows how the sign  resembling a “blowpipe inside a crucible”, repeatedly occurs in inscribed seals/tablets discovered from workshops of metal-workers, goldsmiths and bead-makers, and directly occurs on certain inscribed gold and copper implements. Crucibles and blowpipes being ancient smelting tools, their ideograms ( ,  ,  ) denoted gold-smithy in Egyptian hieroglyphs too. Moreover, certain Indo-Aryan and Dravidian words for metal-smith directly translates to “blowpipe-blower”. Thus archaeological, script-internal and linguistic evidence confirm that sign   signified precious metals and metal-smithy in different contexts. Similarly, fish-like signs (  ,  , etc.), which repeatedly occur in inscriptions discovered from bead-makers’ and jewelers’ workshops across Indus settlements, arguably signified meanings associated with gemstones, bead-making and related metrological standards. Interestingly, in Proto-Dravidian, “mīn” means fish, shining, bright, and gemstone.  Moreover, Indus valley’s eye-patterned gemstone beads were famous as “fish-eye beads” in Mesopotamia. The gemstone related fish-signs sometimes co-occur with  , possibly because, the bead-makers and goldsmiths, who physically shared same workshops, were part of related trade license and taxation mechanisms. This paper also claims that the frequent terminal signs symbolized different volumetric ( ) and weight-based ( )  metrological units used in revenue collection and thus metonymically signified certain tax categories. Specifically, the terminal arrow-like sign , which mostly co-occurs with gemstone and gold-smithy related semasiograms, arguably symbolized a goldsmith’s balance, and metonymically signified tax-payments and trade-permits associated with precious commodities. Since ancient assay balances generally used arrow-like pointers for precise weight measurement (a comparable balance is discovered from Harappa), Indic words for assay balance (eṣaṇī, nārācī) are often etymologically rooted to arrow-words.  This study claims that sign   (allograph  ), symbolized the abrus precatorious seeds, the traditional Indian jeweller’s weight, and metonymically signified goldsmith’s weight system and treasury.

We also test whether a user's opinion or their perception of majority support of their opinion have an impact on either their intention to post a comment or their comments’ sentiment. Results show that exposure to comments, whether positive or negative, almost doubles the intentions of posting a comment. Exposure to negative comments dramatically increases the probability of writing a negative comment, while exposure to positive comments has a moderating effect.

Zur Integration von Verfahren des maschinellen Lernens in die Kommunikationswissenschaft,"In der automatischen Inhaltsanalyse werden die standardisierte manuelle Inhaltsanalyse der Kommunikationswissenschaft und die automatische Textklassifikation des überwachten maschinellen Lernens verbunden, um die wachsende Menge medial vermittelter Inhalte zu beschreiben, analysieren und vergleichen. Qualitätskriterien für die manuelle Inhaltsanalyse zielen auf Validität und Reliabilität ab, während sich Gütekriterien für die automatische Textklassifikation größtenteils mit Reproduzierbarkeit befassen. Zweifel daran, ob Textklassifikationsmodelle inhaltlich relevante Features lernen anstatt auf Scheinkorrelationen oder Artefakte im Datensatz trainiert zu werden, deuten auf ein Validitätsproblem für die automatische Inhaltsanalyse hin: Kommunikationswissenschaftliche Forschung, die diese Methode nutzt, muss sicherstellen, dass die automatische Textklassifikation nicht lediglich zuverlässig reproduziert, sondern gültige Ergebnisse liefert. Diese Arbeit bündelt epistemologische Differenzen in Sozialwissenschaften und Informatik und zeigt daraus resultierende Reibungspunkte im Umgang mit Theorie, Methodologie, Qualitätskriterien und dem Forschungsprozess in der Kommunikationswissenschaft und dem Machine Learning auf. Im Vergleich der Forschungsprozesse zeigt sich, dass das Kriterium der Erklärbarkeit im maschinellen Lernen als Streben nach Validität zu verstehen ist. Daraufhin wird geprüft, welche Erklärbarkeitsstrategien im maschinellen Lernen für eine Validitätsprüfung nutzbar gemacht werden können.

Attempted solutions to wicked conservation problems like tropical deforestation often involve idealised, technical mechanisms. For example, company commitments to “zero deforestation” have become a mainstay of global forest conservation efforts. To be resolved, however, wicked conservation problems require strategically-developed, context-specific mixes of mechanisms. Drawing on interdisciplinary literature from the policy sciences, energy and land-use policy, and conservation, we examine why the contextual complexity of wicked conservation problems demands mixes of mechanisms. We present an operational model of conservation that incorporates the mechanism mix concept. We then explore how the dynamism and uncertainty of wicked problems means mixes of mechanisms must be continually reconfigured. Drawing the concepts of contextual complexity, dynamism and uncertainty together, we propose a conceptual model – the “M3 Model” – which aids understanding of how mechanism mixes can be reconfigured to sustain progress towards a desired outcome. The M3 model has four practical implications, which we discuss with reference to supply chain initiatives to reduce deforestation. First, it makes the need to address multiple interacting variables explicit, countering the tendency to seek panaceas. Second, it emphasises the importance of analysing mechanisms’ contributions to problem amelioration, instead of their shortcomings as idealised solutions. Third, it highlights the possibility of failure, reorienting conservation practice towards learning. Fourth, it emphasises polycentric governance, reinforcing the need for distributed mechanism deployment across stakeholder groups. Our synthesis provides tools to support a holistic, systemic approach to tackling wicked conservation problems.",TRUE,FALSE,Commodities|Conservation|Mechanisms|Policy mix|Zero deforestation,2021-02-03T14:35:23.617208,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-03T14:34:17.622580,TRUE,"J.L.W. has received in-kind research support from Conservation International, Olam International, and The Nature Conservancy; has undertaken paid consultancy work for the HCV Resource Network; and is a member of the Soil Association Palm Oil and Deforestation Task &amp; Finish Working Group.",not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Joss Lyons-White|Kristjan Jespersen|Caleb Gallemore|Allison S.

Children who spent time in non-parental care report poor outcomes in many aspects of their later lives on average, but less is known about differences by type of care.  We examined whether socioeconomic, family, and living arrangements of adults who had been in non-parental care across the first three decades of adult life varied by type of care (residential, non-relative and relative).
Methods
We used longitudinal data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (LS).  Participants were aged&lt;18 years and had never been married at baseline of each census year from 1971-2001 (n=242,843).  Separately for each adult follow-up age (20 to 29; 30 to 39; 40 to 49), multi-level logistic regression models were used to compare socioeconomic, family, and living arrangements by different out-of-home care (OHC) experiences.
Results
Any OHC increased the likelihood of poorer functioning in the three domains of socioeconomic circumstances, family formation and relationships, and living arrangements. This was evident in their 20s, 30s and 40s; the most adverse outcomes were observed for those with a history of residential care, followed by non-relative OHC, and the least adverse outcomes for relative OHC. Moderation by childhood census year, age in OHC, and gender altered the relationship between OHC and some, but not all, adult outcomes. The strongest, most consistent, evidence was for widening of inequalities in age 20-29 outcomes across childhood census years and weakest evidence for any moderation of age 40-49 outcomes by age when in OHC.
Conclusion
Enduring inequalities in social and economic functioning for OHC-experienced adults were found. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the policy to place children in relative care whenever possible, with residential care the least favoured option.",TRUE,FALSE,care|census|child|follow-up|foster|longitudinal|socioeconomic,2021-02-03T14:34:43.976084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-03T14:33:31.344723,FALSE,NA,no,"To ensure confidentiality, the data can only be accessed in secure settings at ONS offices in London, Newport (South Wales) and Titchfield (Hampshire).",,no,No pregregistration carried out,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/citation/,f6b5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60195920c5784b05cbd07a9c/,60195920c5784b05cbd07a9c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6b5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6b5x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6b5x,NA

Methods: We focus on linear models where crime rates are included either as the response or as an explanatory variable, in their original scale, or log-transformed. Two measurement error mechanisms are considered, systematic errors in the form of under-recorded crime, and random errors in the form of recording inconsistencies across areas. The extent to which such measurement error mechanisms impact model parameters is demonstrated algebraically, using formal notation, and graphically, using simulations.
Results: Most coefficients and measures of uncertainty from models where crime rates are included in their original scale are severely biased. However, in many cases, this problem could be minimised, or altogether eliminated by log-transforming crime rates. This transforms the multiplicative measurement error observed in police recorded crime rates into a less harmful additive mechanism.
Conclusions: The validity of findings from regression models where police recorded crime rates are used in their original scale is put into question. In interpreting the large evidence base exploring the effects and consequences of crime using police statistics we urge researchers to consider the biasing effects shown here. Equally, we urge researchers to log-transform crime rates before they are introduced in statistical models.",TRUE,FALSE,bias|crime rates|measurement error|police data,2021-02-03T14:33:01.494671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-03T14:32:21.520567,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/kv3sc/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Jose Pina-Sánchez|David Buil-Gil|Ian Brunton-Smith and Alexandru Cernat,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/citation/,ydf4b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6019323475226b0779517d3a/,6019323475226b0779517d3a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydf4b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydf4b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydf4b,NA
