In this chapter, I review the literature on asexuality and its implications for parenting research and LGBTQ-parent families. First, I explain the meanings of asexuality through a review of its competing definitions and the evolving vocabulary of sexual and romantic dispositions within the asexual community. I also examine the methodological issues that have made asexuality especially difficult to research and the growth of asexuality as an identity movement in resistance to pathologizing narratives of sexual dysfunction. Next, I examine intersections between asexuality and gender, race, class, and disability, with critical attention toward the relationship between asexuality and the broader LGBTQ umbrella. I then review existing knowledge of asexual individuals’ experiences of parenting, intimate relationships, and marginalization. Practitioners are urged to consider the validity of many types of intimacy as research on asexual parenting can further societal understandings of diverse expressions of love and family formation.",TRUE,FALSE,asexualities|asexuality|families|LGBTQ|LGBTQ parents|literature review,2019-07-12T11:07:53.136614,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-12T11:07:11.527324,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/citation/,mwxg3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d278cc1a26b340017080e98/,5d278cc1a26b340017080e98,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwxg3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mwxg3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mwxg3,NA

We extend previous work from Europe, where weak effects were found, in two ways. First, kin effects are likely to be context-dependent and differ by the type and generosity of the welfare state, and by mortality rates. Second, it may be that the grandparent derives more benefits from the grandchild as young child than a new-born or infant. We retest this hypothesis with longitudinal data from the US and England. Both these studies follow people for a longer time so we further test whether effects of grandparenting emerge later after the birth of the grandchild. We found no evidence for these hypotheses in either setting, with the exception of English women who reported higher subjective life expectancy after becoming a grandmother.

Our paper makes a contribution to the sociological theorization of social media. It suggests that the dominant framing of social media in terms derived from communications scholarship, particularly the concept of the public sphere, proves unhelpful when trying to make sense of what people overwhelmingly use social media for in their everyday lives. The networked public sphere prism suggests that unbridled opinion exchange and political debate are what characterize social media and thus define our age. This has been part of the utopian investment in networked forms of communications, and has proven an important aspect in the context of recent protest mobilizations and movements for accountability in which social media played a highly publicized role. However, outside of such normative ideals and exceptional contexts, social media are rarely vehicles for opinion exchange or disruptive movements. Rather, from the perspective of everyday life, social media are more often aligned with order than with disruption, and with the display of status rather than reasoned debate. We propose drawing on the work of Norbert Elias to develop an alternate theorization of social media. Elias' early work on the court society, his analysis of the civilizing process, as well as the larger ""figurational"" approach to the study of human society he founded, are helpful not just in making sense of the status-seeking behavior of social media users, but also the new needs, desires, sensibilities and practices that emerge at the interface of social media and the spaces of everyday life. From Elias' work, we derive structural pressures as well as new sensibilities that emerge in social spaces ordered by an overarching system of rank. While the court-like sociality of social media tends to reinforce rather than challenge social order, this does not rule out that social media can become aligned with movements for social change. In these cases, however, activists have to actively work against pressures toward conformity, so their successes should be seen as exceptions, not as paradigmatic.",TRUE,FALSE,court society|figurational sociology|internet|Norbert Elias|public sphere|social media|social status,2019-07-11T17:15:02.858104,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-11T17:14:38.724156,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/citation/,phm5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d267904a26b3400160854de/,5d267904a26b3400160854de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/phm5x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/phm5x,NA

Background: Much research explores the consequences of parenthood for women, but we know less about health outcomes and trajectories of men who become fathers. Theoretical approaches suggest both health-enhancing changes driven by social control and a new father identity, and health-decreasing changes driven by the costs and burdens of fatherhood.
Method: The NLSY97 longitudinal survey and a battery of novel fixed effects models are used to identify the consequences of paternity on diverse health outcomes, controlling for selectivity based on unobserved characteristics and unobserved trajectories of men who become fathers and accounting for heterogeneity of effects.
Results: Becoming a father induces weight gain and a decline in self-reported health, but reduces alcohol consumption. Effects on weight and alcohol use varied across strata defined by race and education, but changes in self-reported health were consistent across sub-groups.
Conclusion: The transition to fatherhood induces changes in health outcomes and behaviors that are both positive and negative. These consequences are not transitory. Rather, they persist over men’s early adulthood.
Implications: Fatherhood induces health-related changes that endure over the first years after becoming a father, and which may contribute to morbidity and mortality in late adulthood.",TRUE,FALSE,aging|fatherhood|fixed effects|health and illness|millennials|parents|transition to adulthood,2019-07-11T17:16:50.891856,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-11T17:16:15.262203,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/citation/,x4c7m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zvnme/,zvnme,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2645db45253a00193b69b1/,5d2645db45253a00193b69b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4c7m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4c7m,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12732

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade is an original systematic framework whose purpose is to describe human motivation. The implications of the SBST are clear descriptions of the strategies used to motivate people into selecting a specific option. This paper will focus on techniques practiced by companies to persuade customers into purchasing their goods and services. These strategies are derived by manipulating the mathematical relationships of the elements within the proposed system, which then have real-world implications for marketers, managers, psychologists, sociologists, and many other situations where human motivation plays a role.",TRUE,FALSE,consumer behavior|marketing|microeconomics|motivation theory|SBST|social exchange theory|utility theory,2019-07-10T12:49:02.043114,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10T12:48:34.061343,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dad|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Applied Behavior Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/citation/,vapje,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d254eb91c5b4a001a9d47db/,5d254eb91c5b4a001a9d47db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vapje/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vapje/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vapje,NA

(2019) observe higher MTAG polygenic scores for educational attainment among the 53 Jewish respondents with available genomic data in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. They interpret their ensuing analysis as evidence that genetic differences ""mediate"" the association between being Jewish and higher cognitive test scores and higher educational attainment. We demonstrate instead--and perhaps counterintuitively--that the difference between Jewish and non-Jewish polygenic scores are much too large for their analysis to offer any evidentiary value for this conclusion. Instead, the data show clear evidence of the problems with comparing polygenic scores across ethnic groups that others have noted.",TRUE,FALSE,behavior genetics|cognitive differences|educational attainment|polygenic scores|population stratification|sociogenomics,2019-07-10T12:49:22.023837,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10T12:48:57.816969,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Jeremy Freese,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/citation/,eh9tq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d24e9af114a420017027ebd/,5d24e9af114a420017027ebd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh9tq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eh9tq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eh9tq,NA

We theorise that longstanding, western-centric schemas of development and cultural wealth are tightly linked to people’s perceptions of national hierarchy. We examine European publics’ evaluations of their own and other European countries across many attributes using data from the Nation Brands Index surveys. We find that European publics rank northwest European countries highest on developmental attributes and southwestern European nations highest on attributes of cultural wealth, while they rank eastern European countries lowest in both categorisations. Moreover, we show that publics’ rankings of countries load to two related but distinct factors, the contents of which closely reflect schemas of development and cultural wealth. This evidence suggests that these two distinct schemas are simultaneously present in Europeans’ perceptions of national hierarchy.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural wealth|developmental idealism|Europe|national hierarchy,2019-07-10T12:49:42.149420,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10T12:49:32.532106,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/citation/,pd4rb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d24d8eaa26b340019065550/,5d24d8eaa26b340019065550,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd4rb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pd4rb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pd4rb,NA
