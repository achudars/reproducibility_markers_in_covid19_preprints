Previous research suggests that there are significant class inequalities in how much time parents devote to this kind of developmental childcare in the United States. Yet, due in part to data limitations, prior research has not accounted for how class inequalities in family structure, assortative mating, and specialization between partners may exacerbate or ameliorate these gaps. We match parental respondents within the American Time Use Survey to generate synthetic parental dyads, which we use to estimate, in turn, the contributions of family structure, assortative mating, and specialization to class gaps in parental time spent in developmental care of children aged 0-6. We find some evidence that accounting for class differences in family structure widens income gaps in total parental time in developmental childcare of young children. Further, we show that assortative mating of parents further contributes to educational gaps in developmental childcare, while specialization between partners does not offset these wider class divides. While the net effect of these three processes on income-based gaps in childcare time is more modest, accounting for these three processes more than doubles education-based gaps in total parental developmental childcare as compared to maternal time alone.

There is great interest in the relationship between paid and unpaid labor time. Yet, in the United States most studies have focused on the housework component of unpaid labor. Limited research has examined how parental employment status relates to child care time. This study examines how unemployment is related to time in multiple types of child care and how this relationship varies by gender.
Methods
I use data from the 2003-2013 American Time Use Surveys to study cohabiting and married parents ages 18-65 (N=44,198). I predict time spent in total child care, routine child care, and educational/recreational child care by parental unemployment status using ordinary least squares and seemingly unrelated regression models, and examine differences between weekday and weekend time use. 
Results
Consistent with time-based theories, I find unemployed parents spend more time in child care than employed parents, but patterns vary by gender: unemployed mothers and fathers spend more time in child care on weekdays, but unemployed fathers spent less time in child care on weekends.

The negative health effects of unemployment are significant, and the potential for increased morbidity and mortality is a major public health challenge. Negative effects may be partially attributable to health behavior change and loss of social ties. Exercise has positive physical and mental health benefits and could help buffer such negative effects. This study examines whether time in social and solitary exercise varies by unemployment and out of the labor force (OOLF) status because exercise, especially social exercise, provides health benefits.
METHODS
Gender-stratified ordinary least squares models are estimated using data from the nationally representative 2003-2016 American Time Use Surveys to test how own and partner employment status are associated with total time in exercise, exercise alone, with children, with a partner, and with others.
RESULTS
Unemployed and OOLF men spend more time in exercise alone and with others compared to employed men. Unemployed women spend more time in exercise with others, and OOLF women in all types of social exercise, compared to employed women.
CONCLUSIONS
Unemployed and OOLF individuals engage in more social exercise, which could be leveraged to help buffer loss of social ties and improve health.

From an Embedded Agency perspective, marginalized actors are inherently motivated to oppose dominant
prejudices, but lack power and resources to instigate change. Yet, based on institutional micro-foundations, we
posit that even marginalized individuals can be considered legitimate change agents for specific institutional
practices.
Through an ethnography of 76 discriminated women farmers in South-West Cameroon, this article shows the
processes through which marginalized individuals can build inclusive institutions regardless of their peripheral
position within the societal hierarchy.
We find that the institutionalized practices of farmers’ and women’s discrimination differ in their ease of
alterability and introduce ‘acceptable deviance’, the contextualized possibility to change an institution depending
on the individual’s situational legitimacy and the community’s openness to accept changes in that institution.
These insights contribute to the discussions of opportunities in institutional entrepreneurship and bottom-up
solutions to grand challenges.",TRUE,FALSE,bottom-up change|cultural institutions|embedded agency|grand challenges|institution-building,2019-01-23T22:06:21.377655,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-23T22:04:00.426820,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/citation/,ekr2p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c478e3d154ce50018dffe62/,5c478e3d154ce50018dffe62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekr2p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ekr2p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ekr2p,NA
