Produced annually since 1990 in conjunction with the US Census Bureau, the IRS migration data represent 95 to 98 percent of the tax-filing universe and their dependents, making the IRS migration data one of the largest sources of migration data. However, any analysis using the IRS migration data must process at least seven legacy formats of these public data across more than 2000 data files -- a serious burden for migration scholars. 

OBJECTIVE: To produce a single, flat data file containing complete county-to-county IRS migration flow data and to make the computer code to process the migration data freely available. 

METHODS: This paper uses R to process more than 2,000 IRS migration files into a single, flat data file for use in migration research. 

CONTRIBUTION: To encourage and facilitate the use of this data, we provide a single, standardized, flat data file containing county-to-county 1-year migration flows for the period 1990-2010 (containing 163,883 dyadic county pairs resulting in 3.2 million county pair-year observations totaling over 343 million migrants) and provide the full R script to download, process, and flatten the IRS migration data.",TRUE,FALSE,data|demography|IRS|migration|R,2019-03-07T16:53:41.983582,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-07T16:51:52.902095,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/citation/,zmp4t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wgcf3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/relationships/node/,wgcf3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c81253202da7700198f70d3/,5c81253202da7700198f70d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmp4t/,https://doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2019.40.40,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmp4t

Using machine learning methods, we show that the poorest households enjoyed the largest impacts on diet quality and animal protein consumption, while children in the poorest households experienced the largest impacts on the probability of consuming animal source foods.

Is it beneficial to have an educational degree that is linked to only one or a small set of occupations? To answer this question, we generalize existing models of the effects of (mis)match between education and occupation on labor market outcomes. Specifically, we incorporate the structural effects of linkage strength between school and work, which vary considerably across industrialized countries. In an analysis of France, Germany, and the United States, we find that workers have higher earnings when they are in occupations that match their educational level and field of study, but the size of this earnings boost depends on the clarity and strength of the pathway between their educational credential and the labor market. The earnings premium associated with a good occupational match is larger in countries where the credential has a stronger link to the labor market, but the penalty for a mismatch is also greater in such countries. Moreover, strong linkage reduces unemployment risk. These findings add nuance to often-made arguments that countries with loosely structured educational systems have more flexible labor markets and produce better labor market outcomes for workers. An institutional environment that promotes strong school-to-work pathways appears to be an effective strategy for providing workers with secure, well-paying jobs.",TRUE,FALSE,educational attainment|Fields of study|labor markets|unemployment|vocational education,2019-03-06T04:09:21.895553,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-06T04:08:55.041067,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/citation/,df6as,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y2ta9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/relationships/node/,y2ta9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7e6d1aff4a89001c24bf0a/,5c7e6d1aff4a89001c24bf0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/df6as/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/df6as

Research documents the struggles of individuals trying to find their way back into society. Less attention has been given to the organizational aspects of reentry. This is unfortunate given the rapid growth of nonprofit reentry organizations in the U.S., which introduces a new set of questions about the context and challenges to prisoner reentry. Drawing on an ethnography of Safe, a nonprofit reentry organization in the Northeast, I describe the organization's pivotal role in institutionalizing the pathway to prisoner reentry: a road to reentry, which takes former prisoners through a process that reconfigures their morality, identity, and social relationships. The road to reentry concept helps bring together scholars of the welfare state and criminology by highlighting how the challenges of prisoner reentry rely on how this process is organized. The way in which prison reentry is organized, in turn, affects former prisoners' agency and shapes the relationship between these men and women and their respective families and communities.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|criminology|ethnography|organizations|prisoner re-entry|structure|welfare state,2019-03-05T12:22:47.650582,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-05T12:22:07.830178,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/citation/,5kr3x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xcsqa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/relationships/node/,xcsqa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7d0d2cff4a89001925e248/,5c7d0d2cff4a89001925e248,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kr3x/,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12254,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kr3x

Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1823), generally considered the beginning of SF as a genre (Freedman, 2000), tells the tale of a scientist who harnesses technology and electricity to reanimate an entity stitched together from the remains of the recent dead. However, it is telling that Victor Frankenstein is now generally considered a metaphor for the arrogance of scientists who fail to consider the harmful potential of their work. While rarely as dramatic as stories of resurrection, Tony Walter (Walter, 2015) has convincingly argued that for thousands of years every communication technology, from etching in stone and cave paintings onward, has been used to communicate with the dead in some fashion. It comes as no surprise, then, that technology start-ups and entrepreneurs are attempting to harness digital technologies, social media, and networked communication not just to speak to the dead but also to use their digital residues to seemingly offer both resurrection and immortality.
This chapter examines the promotional discourse deployed by three of these futuristic start-up companies – LivesOn (LivesOn, 2013), Eterni.me (“Eterni.me - Virtual Immortality,” 2016) and Humai (Humai, 2016) – and compares these with several notable SF texts which explore the underlying presumptions and broader cultural and social ramifications of these companies succeeding in achieving digital resurrection. The episode ‘Be Right Back’ of the dystopian television series Black Mirror (Harris, 2013) imagines a world where someone could be reconstituted from the detailed record of their lives left behind across various social media accounts, but with clear echoes of Frankenstein. The series returns to these themes in a more endearing fashion in the upbeat ‘San Junipero’ (Harris, 2016) which features a digital afterlife fashioned after the nineteen eighties.  Australian hard SF author and computer scientist Greg Egan also explores this terrain in great detail; his short story ‘Learning to be Me’ (Egan, 1995) and novel Permutation City (Egan, 1994) reveal many of the philosophical presumptions and potential outcomes of a digitised afterlife (Leaver, 2004). In comparing these technology companies and SF texts, this chapter operates on two levels: the first, being to ask what presumptions are being made about contemporary personhood, culture and death; and secondly, mapping what future issues might the success of these start-ups actually provoke.",TRUE,FALSE,data|digital death|frankenstein|greg egan|science fiction|startups,2019-03-05T12:22:01.530445,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-05T12:21:31.189808,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/citation/,2gkw9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/atczd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/relationships/node/,atczd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7cd402773b2d001706244e/,5c7cd402773b2d001706244e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2gkw9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2gkw9

The Gahagan bifaces (n = 102) were scanned, then analysed using a novel landmarking protocol and the tools of geometric morphometrics. Results provide a preview of the significant differences in Gahagan biface morphology expressed between the southern Caddo area and central Texas regions. The size discrepancy represents an inversion of current theoretical constructs that posit a decrease in tool size thought to articulate with an increase in distance from the raw material source. It is posited that the contrasting morphologies represent two discrete communities of practise; one (emergent Caddo horticulturalists) where Gahagan bifaces were enlisted primarily for burial and ritualistic activities, and the other  (central Texas hunter-gatherers) where Gahagan bifaces were utilised over a longer time span in more practical and utilitarian contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,3D geometric morphometrics|archaeological science|computational archaeology|digital humanities|museum studies|NAGPRA|repository studies|STEM|virtual archaeology,2019-03-03T15:14:24.507578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-03T15:14:07.291988,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/citation/,fyw2d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2g95w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/relationships/node/,2g95w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7b9d58773b2d001803326d/,5c7b9d58773b2d001803326d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fyw2d/,https://doi.org/10.1080/0734578X.2020.1744416,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fyw2d
