Neighborhood Boundaries and the Spatial Dynamics of Violent Crime,"Neighborhood boundaries are a defining aspect of highly segregated urban areas. Yet, few studies examine the particular challenges and spatial processes that occur at the bordering region between two neighborhoods. Extending the growing literature on spatial interdependence, this article argues that neighborhood boundaries—defined as sharp changes in the racial or socioeconomic composition of neighborhoods—are a salient feature of the spatial structure with implications for violent crime and other outcomes. Boundaries lack the social control and cohesion of adjacent homogeneous areas, are contested between groups provoking intergroup conflict, and create opportunities for criminal behavior. This article presents evidence linking racial neighborhood boundaries to increased violent crime. The findings illustrate the importance of neighborhood boundaries for our understanding of spatial dimensions of population dynamics above and beyond the characteristics of neighborhoods.",TRUE,FALSE,Crime|Neighborhood boundaries|Neighborhoods|Segregation|Spatial inequality,2018-09-16T19:40:41.247005,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-16T19:40:16.671850,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/citation/,7qmeh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4tr6c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/relationships/node/,4tr6c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9e9d86365fc50019bcebcc/,5b9e9d86365fc50019bcebcc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qmeh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7qmeh/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-018-0708-1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7qmeh

In both state religious and state secular schools, study about Jewish religion, Jewish tradition, Jewish history, and Jewish culture falls under the category of religious and heritage education and, as such, addresses the normative societal values common to both sectors in Israeli Jewish society. In state religious schools religious and heritage education is both faith and knowledge based and is characterized by an emphasis on religious themes underlying societal values, whereas in state secular schools religious and heritage education is entirely knowledge based with emphasis on the secular character of societal values.  
In the present study a questionnaire designed to examine the values of Jewish identity, Jewish tradition, Jewish peoplehood, humanism and universalism was administered to 84 eleventh grade students in Israeli state religious and state secular high schools. Results of the study indicate that while students in the state religious high school hold significantly more intense attitudes toward Jewish identity, Jewish peoplehood and Jewish tradition, students in the state secular high school exhibited significantly more intense attitudes toward humanism and universalism.

Drawing on the Social Balance Theory, we theorized that the formation of “mutual ignoring” triads (three actors in a group with only a pair of interacts) in a network is a key procedure for cyberbalkanization. A cyberbalkanized network was constructed using data shared on Facebook Pages during the 2014 Hong Kong protests. Our findings indicate “mutual ignoring” was a prominent triad network configuration, whereas no such configuration was found in randomly generated networks. Our empirical-based observation was retested with simulation by agent-based model, confirming that “mutual ignoring” is essential for the emergence of cyberbalkanization.

Modeling women’s odds of divorce from 2008 to 2017 using marital events data from the American Community Survey, I find falling divorce rates with or without adjustment for demographic covariates. Age-specific divorce rates show that the trend is driven by younger women, which is consistent with longer term trends showing uniquely high divorce rates among people born in the Baby Boom period. Finally, I analyze the characteristics of newly married women and estimate the trend in their likelihood of divorcing based on the divorce models. The results show falling divorce risks for more recent marriages. The accumulated evidence thus points toward continued decline in divorce rates.

This paper studies the effects of several dissemination channels in an open access environment by analysing the download data of the OAPEN Library. 
Method. Download data were obtained containing the number of downloads and the name of the Internet provider. Based on public information, each Internet provider was categorised. The subject and language of each book were determined using metadata from the OAPEN Library. 
Analysis. Quantitative analysis was done using Excel, while the qualitative analysis was carried out using the statistical package SPSS. 
Results. Almost three quarters of all downloads come from users who do not use the Website www.oapen.org, but find the books by other means. Qualitative analysis found no evidence that channel use was influenced by user groups or the state of users' Internet infrastructure; nor was any effect on channel use found for either the language or the subjects of the monographs. 
Conclusions. The results show that most readers are using the ""direct download"" channel, which occur if the readers use systems other than the OAPEN Library Website. This implies that making the metadata available in the user's systems, the infrastructure used on a daily basis, ensures the best results.",TRUE,FALSE,dissemination channels|Monographs|Open access,2018-09-14T10:48:21.330658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T10:46:28.901031,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/citation/,54c7w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n8hj3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/relationships/node/,n8hj3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9b7e92f769de0018ff83fc/,5b9b7e92f769de0018ff83fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/54c7w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/54c7w

In this paper I use high-resolution data based on unemployment insurance records to show that employment in US metropolitan areas is not centralized but is spatially concentrated. Unlike residents, who form a continuous surface covering most parts of each MSA, jobs have a bimodal spatial distribution, with most blocks containing no jobs whatsoever and a small number having extremely high employment densities. Across the 100 largest MSAs about 75% of jobs are located on the 10% of built land in Census blocks with at least twice as many jobs as people. Further, most of these jobs are in clustered business districts of more than 5 contiguous employment blocks. These relative proportions are extremely consistent across MSAs, even though cities vary greatly in the physical density at which they are constructed. Motivated by these empirical regularities, I introduce an algorithm to identify contiguous business districts and classify them into four major types. Based solely on the relative densities of employment and population, this algorithm is both simpler to implement and more flexible than current approaches, requiring no metro-specific tuning parameters and no assumptions about urban form. As one output, it provides an inductive, data-driven method of identifying city centers for the purposes of urban economic analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Central Business Districts|Employment Subcenters|GIS|Land use|Urb|Urban form|Urban Science,2018-09-14T09:50:40.866805,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T09:44:48.027336,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/citation/,6sxv5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q6g8e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/relationships/node/,q6g8e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9a8cd5bab52700160cc3cd/,5b9a8cd5bab52700160cc3cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6sxv5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6sxv5

Theorists and practitioners have long extolled how polls inextricably link citizens to their elected officials. Indeed, public opinion polls not only offer citizens a mechanism with which to express their sentiment on key issues of the day but also provide policy makers with information about what their constituents might or might not desire. Citizens may be able to express their views on a particular issue through individual acts such as donating money to a cause or writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper, but along with voting polls are one of the few opportunities that offer the mass public equal voice. Moreover, the role that polls play in the citizen–policy maker relationship hinges upon their dissemination by the mass media.",TRUE,FALSE,elections|media|political behavior|political communication|political psychology|polls|public choice|public opinion|strategic voting|voter turnout|voting,2018-09-14T09:41:21.027050,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T09:39:09.418136,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,Patricia Moy and Eike Mark Rinke,2012,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/citation/,32z5j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2une4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/relationships/node/,2une4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b999e23296328001ac7acba/,5b999e23296328001ac7acba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32z5j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/32z5j/,https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230374959_11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/32z5j

Research on social self-organization focuses on explicit and direct communication via network ties, yet it is plausible that extra-network stimuli carry valuable information. Here, I assess the informational value of such stimuli for the self-organization of conventions, a common large-group coordination problem. Participant exposure to a small number of additional stimuli can tip groups to coordinated outcomes through a rapid decrease in the diversity of the potential solutions. The information gained through these exposures is greater on average than that of a variety of alternatives, including additional weak ties. These results suggest actors ought to be attentive to extra-network stimuli and that research assessing the role of social network topology in determining the outcome of social influence and information- driven dynamic processes might often have misspecified causal mechanisms.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral experiment|information theory|network science|social cognition|social conventions,2018-09-12T21:07:40.956133,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-12T21:07:27.004261,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/citation/,zka28,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5wyzt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/relationships/node/,5wyzt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b993aa9715bea0018506850/,5b993aa9715bea0018506850,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zka28/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zka28/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zka28
