decision at both the district court and Federal Circuit levels between 1989

validity questions. Using the dataset from that study, and matching it with
the panels serving on each case, we describe in this paper how individual
Federal Circuit judges voted in patent validity cases during that period.

The results may surprise many patent litigators. While there are some
interesting differences in voting patterns, our overall conclusion is that
the votes of Federal Circuit judges during this period defied easy
description. Judges do not fit easily into ""pro-patent"" or ""anti-patent""
categories, or into ""affirmers"" and ""reversers."" We think this is a good

Constitution requires that juries decide whether patents are valid. But
that assumption rests on an uncertain foundation. Juries did not decide
patent validity during most of American history, and as recently as 30
years ago jury trials in patent cases were quite rare. There is,
surprisingly, no precedential decision resolving the Seventh Amendment
question. And English practice before 1791 -- the basis for Seventh
Amendment jurisprudence -- is ambiguous at best on whether juries must
decide patent validity. I argue that if and when the issue is presented to
the Supreme Court, the Court is unlikely to find a constitutional right to
jury trial on issues of patent validity, and certainly not the broad right
of the sort that is now common practice. Removing the jury from most patent
validity determinations would change patent litigation in important ways.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:24.573813,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:42:21.638000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/citation/,bew4c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qx9v2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/relationships/node/,qx9v2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be14be9ad5a1020668d957/,57be14be9ad5a1020668d957,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bew4c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bew4c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bew4c

the first person to invent something, rather than the first to file a
patent application. In order to determine who is first to invent, the
United States has created an elaborate set of ""interference"" proceedings
and legal standards to define invention and decide how it may be proven.
Supporters of this system claim that it is necessary to protect small
inventors, who may not have the resources to file patent applications
quickly, and may therefore lose a patent race to large companies who
invented after they did. Advocates of global patent harmonization have
suggested, however, that the first inventor is usually also the first to
file, and that the first-to-invent standard is unnecessary and wasteful.

In this Article, we study U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (""PTO"")
interference proceedings and court cases in which the parties dispute who
is first to invent. We find that the first person to file is usually, but
by no means always, also the first to invent. In over 40% of the cases, the
first to invent is last to file. We also find that the long-standing rule
that discriminated against foreign inventors by requiring proof of
inventive activity in the U.S. had surprisingly little effect on outcomes;
that a large number of priority disputes involve near-simultaneous
invention; and that the vast majority of such disputes could be resolved
without reliance on much of the evidence the law permits. Finally, we study
the role of small inventors to see whether they are disproportionately the
beneficiaries of the first to invent system. While the evidence is mixed,
it does not appear that small inventors particularly benefit from the first
to invent system.

Part I describes the legal background for the international debate over how
to determine patent priority. Part II describes our studies and discusses
our results in detail. Finally, Part III draws conclusions for
policy-makers from the data. There is some truth to the arguments of both
sides in this debate. The first to invent system does produce significantly
different results in individual cases than a first to file system would.
But it is not clear that those different results are particularly fairer,
or that they are worth the cost. We suggest some possible ways to modify
the U.S. system to take account of these facts without changing entirely to
a first-to-file system.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:45.138927,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:38:41.552000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/citation/,vgq78,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/794ej/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/relationships/node/,794ej,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be13e39ad5a101fb68d994/,57be13e39ad5a101fb68d994,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vgq78/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vgq78

unless they practice the complete invention. Nonetheless, patent courts
have long recognized that focusing only on the party who actually practices
the invention will sometimes let off the hook the party who most deserves
to be held liable. Thus, for over a century patent courts have extended
liability to one who does not himself infringe, but who actively induces
infringement by another. Since 1952, this principle has been enshrined in
section 271(b) of the patent statute. As an idea, it has proven
uncontroversial.

Surprisingly, however, despite the venerable nature of inducement in patent
law, the actual content of the inducement requirement has remained
something of a mystery. In particular, courts have proven unable to decide
two fundamental issues - what it means actually to induce infringement, and
what the inducer must know and intend in order to be liable for acting.
Though the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
was created in 1982, now handles all patent appeals, it has not brought
uniformity to either issue. Indeed, there are Federal Circuit opinions
taking diametrically opposed positions on the law of inducement. This
confusion is doubly unfortunate given that the Supreme Court has recently
imported the law of inducement from patent into copyright law. Before we
adopt the concept of inducement in copyright cases, it would seem helpful
to know what exactly it means in patent cases.

In this article, I set out the fundamental disagreements among the courts
as to the conduct and intent prongs of inducement. I explore the policies
behind inducement law, and suggest that these disagreements can best be
resolved not by picking one side or the other, but by thinking of
inducement as a sliding scale inquiry in which a more specific intent to
infringe is required to find liability if the defendant's conduct is
otherwise less egregious. This resolution not only makes policy sense, and
integrates section 271(b) with the rest of the statute, but it may even
have the virtue of explaining most of the apparently conflicting caselaw.
Application of this sliding scale approach also has implications for
secondary liability in copyright law.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:31.686574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:28:40.252000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/citation/,7guw6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/634qf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/relationships/node/,634qf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be11896c613b01ead93923/,57be11896c613b01ead93923,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7guw6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7guw6

significant exceptions, the basic rule of trademark law is that a
defendant’s use of a mark is illegal if it confuses a substantial number of
consumers and not otherwise.

As a general matter, this is the right rule. Trademark law is designed to
facilitate the workings of modern markets by permitting producers to
accurately communicate information about the quality of their products to
buyers, and therefore to encourage them to invest in making quality
products in circumstances in which that quality wouldn’t otherwise be
apparent. If competitors can falsely mimic that information, they will
confuse consumers, who won’t know whether they are in fact getting a high
quality product and therefore won’t be willing to pay as much for that
quality. I won’t pay as much for an iPod if I think there is a chance it is
a cheap knock-off masquerading as an iPod.

The law of false advertising operates as an adjunct to trademark law. While
trademark law prevents competitors from misrepresenting the source of their
products by mimicking another’s brand name, the law of false advertising
prevents false or misleading statements about the quality of one’s own or a
competitor’s products. Like trademark law, false advertising law is
designed to protect the integrity of markets by allowing consumers to rely
on statements made by sellers.

Unfortunately, trademark law has taken the concept of confusion too far.
Between 1930 and 1980, courts expanded the concept of confusion beyond
confusion as to the source of a product to include the possibility that
consumers are confused as to whether the trademark owner sponsors or is
affiliated with the defendant’s goods. This expansion began for plausible
reasons: consumers might be confused to their detriment in a variety of
circumstances in which the plaintiff and the defendant do not actually
compete directly. But sponsorship and affiliation confusion has taken on a
life of its own, resulting in a large number of cases in which companies or
individuals are prevented from doing things that might conceivably confuse
consumers, but do not confuse consumers in any way that harms their
decision-making process or that the law should care about. In Part I, we
offer a number of examples of “confusion” that courts have found actionable
even in circumstances in which that confusion was unlikely to matter to the
operation of the market. Part II explains how we arrived at this
unfortunate pass.

We suggest in Part III that trademark law should focus its attention on
confusion that is actually relevant to purchasing decisions. We would make
the source of the goods the central element of confusion analysis. It is
confusion as to source that is most obviously relevant to the purposes
behind trademark law. That does not mean, however, that confusion as to the
relationship between plaintiff and defendant can never be actionable.
Confusion as to affiliation should be actionable when consumers are likely
to believe that the trademark owner stands behind or guarantees the quality
of the goods the defendant sells. Even if consumers understand that
individual franchisees, rather than the McDonald’s Corporation, actually
make their hamburgers, they are likely to expect that McDonald’s stands
behind whatever quality that brand represents.

Finally, the fact that confusion as to sponsorship or affiliation should
not generally be trademark infringement does not mean that it will never be
actionable. Some statements that create confusion as to sponsorship or
affiliation will be actionable as a form of false advertising. We address
the scope of false advertising in Part IV. Notably, proof of a false
advertising claim requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the
misrepresentation is material – that it is likely to affect a product
purchasing decision. Indeed, the statute specifies the sorts of
misrepresentations that are forbidden. We continue the discussion in Part
V, which explores some of the implications of shunting some cases into the
false advertising framework, and discusses how to handle some close cases.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:18.102146,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:27:31.615000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/citation/,4ea9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8wg4s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/relationships/node/,8wg4s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be11459ad5a1020968da1e/,57be11459ad5a1020968da1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ea9v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ea9v

the global market for licensing and marketing sports-related merchandise at
$17 billion in 2001. With this much money at stake, it's no surprise that
trademark holders demand royalties for use of their marks on shirts, key
chains, jewelry, and related consumer products. After all, the value of
these products comes largely from the allure of the trademarks, and it
seems only fair to reward the party that created that value . . . doesn't
it?

It turns out that the answer is more complicated than this intuitive
account would predict. Trademark law historically has existed primarily to
protect against the consumer deception that occurs when one party attempts
to pass off its products as those of another. From an economic and policy
perspective, it is by no means obvious that trademark holders should have
exclusive rights over the sale of products that use marks for their
ornamental or intrinsic value, rather than as indicators of source or
official sponsorship. Trademark law seeks to promote, rather than hinder,
truthful competition in markets for products sought by consumers; if a
trademark is the product, then giving one party exclusive rights over it
runs in tension with the law's pro-competitive goals, frequently without
any deception-related justification. On the other hand, there may be
circumstances in which consumers expect that trademark holders sponsored or
produced products bearing their mark, in which case use of the mark by
others - even as a part of a product - might result in genuine confusion.

Given these complexities, together with the economic interests at stake,
one might expect that the law and practice of merchandising rights would be
well-settled and reflect a considered balancing of the interests of
trademark holders and their competitors. In reality, however, much of the
multi-billion dollar industry of merchandise licensing has grown around a
handful of cases from the 1970s and 1980s that established merchandising
rights with little regard for the competing legal or policy concerns at
stake. Those cases are far from settled law - indeed, at least as many
decisions decline to give trademark owners the right to control sales of
their trademarks as products. We think it is high time to revisit that case
law and to reconsider the theoretical justifications for a merchandising
right.

That review provides little support for trademark owners' assumptions about
merchandising. Doctrinally, the most broad-reaching merchandising cases -
which presumed infringement based on the public recognition of the mark as
a trademark - were simply wrong in their analysis of trademark infringement
and have been specifically rejected by subsequent decisions.
Philosophically, even a merchandising right that hinges on likelihood of
confusion raises competition-related concerns that should affect courts'
analysis of both the merits and appropriate remedies in merchandising
cases. Perhaps most importantly, recent Supreme Court case law suggests
that, if it had the opportunity to evaluate the merchandising theory

right. Further, the Court would be right to do so. When a trademark is

competition suffers - and consumers pay - if other sellers are shut out of

omnipresent intellectual property rights. In this paper, we attempt to
explore the relationship between the two, focusing on two examples: the
government's antitrust proceeding against Microsoft for browser tying, and
Sun's suit against Microsoft for altering Java. We conclude that the social
value of the Internet lies in its ability to facilitate interoperation, and
this in turn argues in favor of open access to network standards. Such open
standards may be achieved in the open market. Where they are not, the law
may intervene, but it must be cautious not to overreach and to avoid
disturbing the incentives provided by intellectual property protection.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:08.177423,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:23:21.442000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/citation/,sf5ry,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3zugu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/relationships/node/,3zugu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be104ab83f6901f86563e7/,57be104ab83f6901f86563e7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf5ry/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sf5ry/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sf5ry

norms on the Internet, either by abdicating its role entirely to cyberspace
self-governance, or by carving out particular roles for nonlegal
rulemaking. I challenge these assertions. I argue that Internet norms are
elusive and rapidly changing, and that in most cases there is nothing like
the consensus required for norm creation. I contend that Internet norms are
likely to be inefficient, particularly when they are enforced by the
underlying threat of exclusion from the network itself. Finally, I suggest
that neither Net ""vigilantes,"" judges, nor code itself can be relied upon
to identify and enforce Internet norms with an appropriate sensitivity to
efficiency and policy concerns.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:43.828138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:21:15.559000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/citation/,n3auz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bbvwx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/relationships/node/,bbvwx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be0fcd9ad5a101fa68db3d/,57be0fcd9ad5a101fa68db3d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3auz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n3auz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n3auz
