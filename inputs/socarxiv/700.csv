However, TAPGs are also embedded in networks of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and foundations, and may thus be subject to NGOization. This paper examines two bodies of data relevant to this issue: (1) network data that highlight TAPGs’ links to major sources of funds as well as key IGOs; (2) reflections of TAPG protagonists gleaned from in-depth interviews conducted at these groups. While our network analysis is consistent with the NGOization narrative, and while our participants offered many narratives of their own in line with it, they also provided more nuanced accounts that begin to specify the contingencies mediating between, on the one hand, resort to formal organization and to working with IGOs and foundations, and on the other hand, descent into hegemonic incorporation. In a neoliberal political-economic environment, the future of counter-hegemonic politics hinges partly on our identifying how ‘preventative measures’ can be brought to bear on processes of NGOization.",TRUE,FALSE,Counter-hegemony|Global civil society|NGOization|Social movements|Transnational networks,2018-07-02T10:59:32.027738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-10T23:33:51.265863,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Authors,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/citation/,9avhy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7fjd3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/relationships/node/,7fjd3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593c80c19ad5a1022d774c15/,593c80c19ad5a1022d774c15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9avhy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9avhy/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0896920515589004,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9avhy

Third, it summarizes the main findings on the cohesiveness of the corporate community, the hegemonic position of banks, and historical changes and longitudinal dynamics of the network.

Climate capitalism seeks to redirect investments from fossil energy to renewable energy generation, so as to foster an ecological modernization of production and reduce GHG emissions. 
I use social network analysis to assess the potential for climate capitalism, as a project of a section of the corporate elite, to replace the current ‘carboniferous capitalist’ regime. Corporate-funded climate and environmental policy groups (CEPGs) constitute major venues for the corporate elite to assemble and plan their response to the climate crisis. By mapping out the network of board-level interlocks between CEPGs and the largest transnational corporations, I first find that certain CEPGs are centrally located among the global intercorporate network, and thus well positioned to promote climate capitalism among the corporate elite. Second, I delineate a climate capitalist inner circle that includes the individual members of the corporate community who arguably are able to exert the greatest power to shape climate capitalism. However, many of them, close to the oil and nuclear sectors, may support a long-term transition away from fossil fuels, incompatible with avoiding dangerous climatic warming.",TRUE,FALSE,Climate capitalism|Climate change|Climate politics|Environmental sociology|Inner circle|Interlocking directorates|Social network analysis|Transnational corporations,2018-07-02T10:59:31.881648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-10T23:13:50.134314,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Author,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/citation/,7xdfh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8bt56/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/relationships/node/,8bt56,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578d50f1594d9001f28164d7/,578d50f1594d9001f28164d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7xdfh/,https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2015.1111490,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7xdfh

In this case, the study addressed: 1) polyrhythmia at different scales produced by algorithms, technology, management and urban life, and; 2) the process of organizing multiple timelines to tune the ‘heartbeat’ of the city. Time is a resource for coordination and regulation, as well as for making sense of actions and experience. Being increasingly dispersed, and black-boxed in a multiplicity of processes affecting and configuring the way the past, present and future are perfomed and lived, time also represents a new object of concern for the ethnographic investigation of algorithmic management. I argue that ethnography allows us to understand the material organizing of dispersed and heterogeneous temporalities while also intersecting with such temporalities. Drawing on Guattari and Deleuze’s concept of ‘refrain’ and from Lefebvre’s ‘rhythmanalysis’, I introduce the concepts of rhythm-making and halfway ethnography with the purpose of accounting for the manufacturing of multiple temporalities and for the time-boundedness that links ethnographic practice and the technological, organizational, and cultural ‘heartbeats’ of fieldwork. This approach intends to temporally and spatially reposition organizational ethnography, offering analytical tools to study new contemporary entanglements of ethnographic practice and data.",TRUE,FALSE,automated management|city heartbeat|halfway ethnography|rhythm-making|time,2018-07-02T10:59:31.517277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-09T12:02:31.521350,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/citation/,ydut4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k3y5h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/relationships/node/,k3y5h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593a8ce2594d90023e42c7b5/,593a8ce2594d90023e42c7b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydut4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydut4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydut4

But while this anti-imperialist spirit was no doubt present at Bandung, so were many other spirits, including those of Cold War realpolitik. We consider the different meanings of Bandung by examining the critical role Yugoslavia played in the rise of the Non-Aligned Movement in years that followed the summit. Drawing on primary historical documents, we show that Yugoslav leaders consistently failed to appreciate the racism of the international society and their own racialised privilege in it. They did appreciate, however, that performing solidarity with the decolonised and decolonising nations would bring major status rewards to Yugoslavia in the context of the East-West showdown. That self-consciously anti-imperialist and anti-colonial positions can be thickly enveloped in white ignorance suggests the need for more critical International Relations analyses of race, racism and racialised international hierarchies.",TRUE,FALSE,non-alignment|performance|race|status|whiteness|Yugoslavia,2018-07-02T10:59:31.353967,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-08T21:22:02.318294,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Jelena Subotic &amp; Srdjan Vucetic,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/citation/,x8fje,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k5xmc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/relationships/node/,k5xmc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5939bf95b83f690233303166/,5939bf95b83f690233303166,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8fje/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x8fje/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x8fje

Wisconsin imprisonment rates declined slightly after the mid-2000s, but have risen since 2014. A detailed investigation of patterns of movement into and out of prison by offense and admission type (new sentence vs. revocation) shows that the decline after 2007 was small and the seeds of the rebound after 2012 in incarceration were present in the earlier trends. A steep decline in prison admissions for drug sentences and a decline in prison admissions for revocations after 2007 masked continuing slow rises in imprisonment from new commitments for other offenses, especially rape and murder. After 2012, a rise in revocations across offense groups and a rise in new commitments for drug offenses and several other categories of offenses led to a rise in the total imprisonment rate. The patterns by offense and admission type suggest that changes in violent crime rates and in sentence lengths within offense category play relatively little role in these trends. Total imprisonment trends are products of complex processes affecting different groups differently. Policy recommendations emphasize the drug war, sex offenders, and revocations for technical violations as the areas having the largest numerical impact on trends in imprisonment in Wisconsin. An appendix gives additional details about offenses and admission types. The report itself includes seven color graphs which show trends in imprisonment by offense and category of admission and the appendix includes another 22 color graphs that show the trends for each offense and the offense trends by admission type. The graphs attached to the report are printed two to a page. Alternate files include a separate copy of just the graphs printed one to a page for improved legibility,  a copy of the text with no graphs and a  shorter version without the appendix.

However, the degree to which political communication researchers can live up to this task depends on how systematically they relate their empirical investigations to concerns formulated in normative conceptions of democracy. In this paper, I present a framework for the empirical normative analysis of political communication. Based on the two core research procedures of normative assessment and empirical validation, it provides a model of the relations between normative and empirical research and a template for the empirical study of normatively relevant aspects of political communication. The paper systematizes the relations between normative theory and empirical reality, and discusses the two core procedures for empirical researchers to productively bridge the two. The framework is supposed to foster systematic exchanges between empirical studies of political communication and normative democratic theory and clarify the contribution of empirical studies to democratic theory, practice, and reform. It also implicates additional justification for greater use of controlled experimental research and cross-context comparative studies.",TRUE,FALSE,communication|democracy|democratic theory|empirical validation|normative analysis|normative assessment|normative theory|political communication|public sphere|research design,2018-07-02T10:59:31.224763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-08T12:42:39.051441,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,Eike Mark Rinke,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/citation/,xawyf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8u5vb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/relationships/node/,8u5vb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593945d1594d90023458e4b5/,593945d1594d90023458e4b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xawyf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xawyf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xawyf
