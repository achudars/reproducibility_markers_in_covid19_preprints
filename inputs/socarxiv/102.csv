Eastern European Children in Western Europe,"Since the end of the Cold War, millions of migrants from Eastern Europe have sought better opportunities in Western European countries, yet few studies have assessed the impact of such moves on these migrants' children. This study employs a causal dissimilation approach to examine the effect of migration on children’s educational outcomes. It analyzes Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores from 2012, 2015, and 2018 for children born in twelve Eastern European countries and living in eight Western European countries. Compared to their counterparts who remained in their countries of origin, migrant children attain lower reading, math, and science scores. Once immigrant children are matched to non-immigrants with similar propensities to migrate, the disparity for math scores disappears, while those for reading and science remain. Children who migrate from within the EU, at older ages, who speak a foreign language at home, and who are female face greater disparities. This paper shows how a dissimilation perspective yields different insights than a classic assimilation approach and shows the need for policymakers and educational administrators to better handle the negative academic effects that migration can have on children from within Europe.",TRUE,FALSE,causal inference|education|Europe|immigration,2020-10-07T15:15:27.573524,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-07T15:14:52.285800,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/citation/,y9xc4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vb9rm/,vb9rm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7cf287cc246f00bc74e9ab/,5f7cf287cc246f00bc74e9ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9xc4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y9xc4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y9xc4

Compared to income boosts, income losses due to policy change have been seldom examined via an intergenerational lens. Besides, research on income boosts has centred around parental investments of time and money, and has largely focused on maternal inputs during early and middle childhood. To complement that, we show how income losses may spill over via financial hardship, psychological distress, and parenting. We consider both maternal and paternal inputs and highlight how shocks timed around children’s adolescence can affect socio-emotional skills that are key to long-run outcomes.
We analyse income losses following tax-benefit reform in Great Britain in the period 2009-2019 (UK Household Longitudinal Study). Based on an instrumental variable approach, our findings show that benefit income losses stiffened financial hardship, particularly in the form of housing arrears and subjective worries. These are accompanied by worsening maternal mental health, less effective parenting by both mothers and fathers, and increased problem behaviour among their adolescent children. Benefit income loss also seems to push parents into employment, but effects suggest neither a substantial re-direction of time from the household to the market nor do labour earnings offset benefit income losses money-wise. Findings thus speak to debates on the consequences and timing of income for children and family environments, bringing to the fore the intergenerational consequences of welfare cutbacks.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescence|austerity|child development|family income|family stress|instrumental variable|intergenerational|mental health|parenting|social policy|timing of income|UK|welfare reform,2020-10-07T15:17:01.640221,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-07T15:16:30.767454,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be accessed at the UK Data Archive.,,no,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/citation/,vdej8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3c9vs/,3c9vs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7cadc01f65a5007aed0f35/,5f7cadc01f65a5007aed0f35,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdej8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vdej8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vdej8

Investigating the role of economic inequality and risk perceptions in the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,"Economic inequality is understood as a country-level risk factor that increases the spread of infectious diseases. The Novel Coronavirus presents somewhat contradictory evidence of this because the most equal countries in the world experienced deaths per capita as high as the most unequal. We label this the ‘Swedish paradox’. We theorize that inequality has a non-linear association with disease spread because of risk perceptions among the public. Risk perceptions that are extreme in either direction – toward nonchalance or outright panic – lead to behaviors that increase infection1. Highly equal countries like Sweden had very low risk perceptions at the beginning of the pandemic and this may have led to individual and public actions that increase infection risk. To test this, we modeled the role of economic inequality on infection through the mediating role of risk perceptions in April, in 74 countries. We measured the intensity of the outbreak and government interventions in March as key predictors of risk perceptions. This lets us identify ‘over’ or ‘under’ concern and whether these extremes in the distribution of risk perceptions predicts infection increase in May, measured as death rates with an 18-day lead. We find that inequality has a large linear association with risk perceptions in April (0.50 as a standardized [beta] coefficient). We find that risk perceptions in April have a moderate association with infection increase in May (0.24 beta) and these effects are non-linear. Societies below a disposable income inequality Gini of around 31 were prone to slightly more infection in May as a function of less inequality, whereas societies above 31 were prone to much more infection as a function of more inequality, all else equal. This offers some clarification of the Swedish paradox; however, the biggest effects of inequality on infection occur at the upper end of the distribution meaning inequality is only a small piece of this puzzle.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|COVIDiSTRESS|Economic Inequality|Government Intervention|Income Inequality|Novel Coronavirus Pandemic|Outbreak Severity|Risk Perceptions|Social Inequality,2020-10-08T01:26:20.627512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-08T01:26:02.397476,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/nbreznau/Ineq_Risk_Covid,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/citation/,re7sn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7c8e94a5e94700631bdc04/,5f7c8e94a5e94700631bdc04,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/re7sn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/re7sn

Second, we used SAS-theory to formalize Scarcity, Abundance and Sufficiency (SAS) in an agnostic manner, tying them to different behavioral strategies that individuals use when engaging with a specific resource state. Third, we formalize the relation between individual and systemic level SAS. This relation is influenced by entitlement functions, allowing the distinction between an individual’s experience of absolute and quasi-SAS. This difference is essential, as quasi-SAS implies different exchange motivations and strategies than absolute SAS. Lastly, we demonstrate the formalized relations through two examples of abundance-based motivations, and how quasi-scarcity requires different explanations than absolute scarcity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-07T15:20:29.792675,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-07T15:20:08.378275,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/citation/,3une2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7c5d39cc246f0071750171/,5f7c5d39cc246f0071750171,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3une2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3une2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3une2

Among the standard models for COVID-19 global pandemic prediction, simple epidemiological and statistical models have received more attention by authorities, and they are popular in the media. Due to a high level of uncertainty and lack of essential data, standard models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. Although the literature includes several attempts to address this issue, the essential generalization and robustness abilities of existing models needs to be improved. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and soft computing models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak as an alternative to SIR and SEIR models. Among a wide range of machine learning models investigated, two models showed promising results (i.e., multi-layered perceptron, MLP, and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, ANFIS). Based on the results reported here, and due to the highly complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research. Paper further suggests that real novelty in outbreak prediction can be realized through integrating machine learning and SEIR models.",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|Deep Learning|Huge Data|Machine Learning|Model|Prediction|Time-Series|Time series Data,2020-10-06T10:00:24.444123,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-06T09:59:57.854241,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/citation/,37b8f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7c19fea5e94700431ba0a7/,5f7c19fea5e94700431ba0a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/37b8f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/37b8f/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/37b8f

Despite expectations that alliances should lead to decreased military spending, the empirical record offers mixed findings. We argue that not all alliances are reliable, thus only allies that receive signals of reassurance will rely on allies and subsequently reduce their military spending. Compared to states that do not receive additional signals, these reassured allies will have greater confidence that an ally will come to their aid. As a result, third party aggressors are deterred and the demand for military spending will decrease. We test this argument with an analysis of U.S. signals of support, alliance commitments, and military spending. We find that alliances without additional signals of support have a negligible effect on military spending. Yet, we observe that signals of support are negatively associated with military spending among U.S. allies. Additional tests indicate that strong U.S. signals, coupled with alliance commitments, are also associated with lower military spending in the rivals of U.S. allies. Our results potentially help explain the mixed evidence in the arms-versus-allies and burden-sharing literatures and further demonstrate that signals play an important role in the practice of international relations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-06T10:00:00.914910,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-06T09:59:30.426656,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/citation/,acrpb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7c02851f65a50040ed5df5/,5f7c02851f65a50040ed5df5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acrpb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acrpb/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/acrpb
