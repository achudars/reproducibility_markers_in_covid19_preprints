By focusing on variations in authoritarianism and democratic rule during the 1990s, this paper tests the hypothesis that an increase in democratic rule produces changes to environmental protection along two levels, legal framework and institutional accountability. The dependent variables are democratization and authoritarianism. The independent variable is the level of environmental protection in the public policy outcome. The qualitative analysis is focused on the factors and causal mechanism that allows to evaluate the hypothesis. The findings are that the periods of authoritarian rule and democratic rule are highly influenced by two factors. The first is domestic (postcolonial institutions, regime’s organizational strength, elites’ cleavages, revolutionary and counterrevolutionary movements, and the strength of environmental movement) and second international (western linkage and international organizations’ influence).

Much of what is known about the relationship between tornadoes and casualties—injuries and fatalities—is driven by quantitative methods that often omit individual community factors. In response, here we present a place-based analysis of tornado activity and casualties in Shreveport, Louisiana. Results show that tornado casualties are more likely in smooth and lower topography and in formally redlined neighborhoods. Results also indicate that areas around the local Barksdale Air Force Base have experienced fewer casualties than other parts of the city since the installation of a Doppler Radar in 1995 and that Shreveport has a greatly reduced casualty rate since the Super Outbreak of 2011.

What constraints do workers face when attempting to exercise this flexibility? We use 30 worker interviews and other data to compare three online piecework platforms with differing histories and worker demographics: Mechanical Turk, MobileWorks, and CloudFactory. We find that structural constraints (availability of work and degree of worker dependence on the work), as well as cultural-cognitive constraints (procrastination and presenteeism), limit worker control over scheduling in practice. The severity of these constraints varies significantly between platforms, the formally freest platform presenting the greatest structural and cultural-cognitive constraints. We also find that workers have developed informal practices, tools, and communities to address these constraints.

Scholars have devoted significant attention to understanding how domestic political concerns influence military strategy, but we do not yet know how these concerns are shaped by military labor policies. We argue that conscription systems determine how the human costs of war are distributed throughout society, and in turn, the government’s tolerance for battlefield casualties in pursuit of victory. Using new data on every country’s conscription policy from 1800 to the present, we demonstrate that countries with selective conscription experience more casualties than those with universal conscription or volunteer militaries. To examine the mechanism we theorize, we then conduct an in-depth case study of the United States’ experience during the Vietnam War. Using a

In this study, I examine inequality divergence, or the inequality of inequalities. While divergence trends of central tendencies such as per capita income have been well documented, less is known about the descriptive trends or contributing mechanisms for inequality. In this study, I construct wage inequality measures in 722 local labor markets covering the entire contiguous United States across 22 waves of Census and American Community Survey data from 1940-2019 to assess the historical trends of inequality divergence. I apply variance decomposition and counterfactual techniques to develop main conclusions. Inequality divergence follows a u-shaped pattern, declining through 1990 but with contemporary divergence at as high a level as any time in the past 80 years. Early era convergence occurred broadly and primarily worked to reduce interregional differences, whereas modern inequality divergence operates through a combination of novel mechanisms, most notably through highly unequal urban areas separating from other labor markets. Overall, results show geographical fragmentation of inequality underneath overall inequality growth in recent years, highlighting the fundamental importance of spatial trends for broader stratification outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative Historical|Divergence|Inequlity|Local Labor Markets|Spatial Inequality,2021-07-09T20:40:23.062907,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-09T20:40:05.806137,FALSE,NA,no,Replication materials available upon request.

In this paper, we analyse the strategy of the UK Government during the Covid-19 pandemic to argue it entails a form of productive enrolment of ‘unknowns’ we label ‘surfing ignorance’. This strategy exploits inevitable limits to knowledge of any particular group of actors, and attempts to steer them to maintain political control. We argue this approach departs from the uses of knowledge and ignorance in both classical liberalism and neoliberalism, and theorize a new, hybrid form of governance which can be dubbed fatalistic liberalism.

The European circular economy targets limit the share of municipal waste in landfills to a maximum of 10% by 2035. Consequently, waste-to-energy plants may temporarily become the primary option for residual unsorted waste. The municipal waste management chain comprises two consequential stages: collection and transport, and the treatment and disposal stage, which characterizes as an oligopolistic market structure. After defining the relevant market and calculating market concentration measures, we analyze market power in the treatment and disposal of non-recyclable mixed waste, also known as residual waste. Our analyses are based on empirical data using well-known market concentration indices such as the Herfindahl–Hirschman index and concentration ratios. We report the results of three different market concentration scenarios based on alternative geographic and product market definitions. Considering only waste-to-energy as a product market, we present a situation of moderate concentration, typically involving the attention of competition authorities. On the contrary, considering both options as a single product market, no relevant evidence emerges due to the significant share of waste sent to landfills in 2019, i.e., 20.1% of the total municipal solid waste generated in Italy. Implications for future studies consist of new detailed information on the municipal waste treatment market structure in one of the leading European countries that may prompt comparative studies. Policy implications are derived from the possibility of taking cues from this paper to envisage appropriate regulatory models for an evolving sector in which market spaces are increasing.",TRUE,FALSE,circular economy|hhi|landfill|market power|market structure|municipal solid waste|waste management|waste regulation|waste to energy,2021-07-09T20:32:41.919898,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-09T20:32:14.122867,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/citation/,fwk6d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e83aa3600da5013e0a4b2a/,60e83aa3600da5013e0a4b2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwk6d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fwk6d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fwk6d,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137412

The following study examines the gender ratio concerning authorship within two popular journals in the field of mechanics: Computer Methods in Ap-plied Mechanics and Engineering (CMAME) and Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids (JMPS). The examined periods include the years 2002 and 2017. Beyond that, we paid attention to the individual citations of the articles and the first author’s h-indices as well.
In these journals, the percentage of female authors in the field of mechanics is significantly lower than the number of female graduates and doctoral candidates in the field would suggest. Even if there was a slight increase in publications of women in the investigated period, male scientists’ contributions were still dominating the research field of mechanics in 2017.",TRUE,FALSE,authorship|engineering|first author|gender gap|h-index|STEM Disciplines,2021-07-11T15:35:24.350211,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-11T15:35:08.676649,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.elsevier.com/de-de,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/citation/,e43q9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e837f8924b40013a4ed6bb/,60e837f8924b40013a4ed6bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e43q9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e43q9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e43q9,NA
