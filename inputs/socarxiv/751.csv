from policing to trials to sentencing. The United States incarcerates a higher percentage of its population than any of its peer countries, with 2.2 million people behind bars. The criminal justice system disproportionately harms communities of color: while they make up 30 percent of the U.S. population, they represent 60 percent of the incarcerated population. There has been some discussion of how “big data” can be used to remedy inequalities in the criminal justice system; civil rights advocates recognize potential benefits but remained fundamentally concerned that data-oriented approaches are being designed and applied in ways that also disproportionately harms those who are already marginalized by criminal justice processes.

Like any other powerful tool of governance, data mining can empower or disempower groups. The values that go into an algorithm, and the metrics it optimizes for, are baked into its design. Data could be used to identify discrimination in current practices, or to predict where certain combinations of data points are likely to lead to an erroneous conviction. When algorithms are designed to improve how law enforcement regimes are deployed, the question that data analytics raises is, which efficiencies are we optimizing for? Who are the stakeholders, and where do they stand to gain or lose? How do these applications intersect with core civil rights concerns? Where can we use big data techniques to improve the structural conditions criminal justice system that lead to disparate impacts on marginalized communities?

This article offers a framework for explaining these processes of regulatory marketization. First, I argue that institutions of this sort are examples of what I call command-and-commodify regulation, a mode of regulation that distinctively hybridizes economic and authoritative dimensions of power. Second, I explain how and why one example of command-and-commodify regulation, species conservation banking, emerged and remained concentrated in California, but did not so easily develop in other American states. Finally, abstracting from the case, I argue that the concept of market reconstruction is useful for developing a more general theory of the ways that social conflicts and mobilization reconfigure regulatory power, and thus give rise to new modes of regulation. Together, a theory of command-and-commodify regulation and market reconstruction may be useful for explaining the development of a wide variety of environmentally focused and other regulatory institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,commodification|endanged species|environment|institutional change|institutional emergence|markets|regulation,2018-07-02T10:49:06.318591,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-29T20:53:42.571000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/citation/,f6ux4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e5hz6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/relationships/node/,e5hz6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/586576ad9ad5a10209ba6c1d/,586576ad9ad5a10209ba6c1d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6ux4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6ux4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6ux4,NA

Once a thriving city drawing blacks as blue-collar workers during the Great Migration, Benton Harbor, Michigan has suffered from waves of out-migration, debt, and alleged poor management. Benton Harbor’s emphasis on high-end economic development to attract white-collar workers and tourism, amidst the poverty, unemployment, and disenfranchisement of black residents, highlights an extreme case of American urban inequality. At the same time, many bystanders and representative observers argue that this urban redevelopment scheme and the city’s takeover by the state represent Benton Harbor residents’ only hope for a better life. I interviewed 44 key players and observers in local politics and development, attended 20 public meetings, conducted three months of observations, and collected extensive archival data. Examining Benton Harbor’s time under emergency management and its luxury golf course development as two exemplars of a larger relationship, I find that the top-down processes allegedly intended to alleviate Benton Harbor’s inequality actually reproduce and deepen the city’s problems. I propose that the beneficiaries of both plans constitute a white urban regime active in Benton Harbor. I show how the white urban regime serves its interests by operating an extraction machine in the city, which serves to reproduce local poverty and wealth by directing resources toward the white urban regime and away from the city.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:46:29.099266,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-09T14:30:39.089000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/citation/,6qx9j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q5zzg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/relationships/node/,q5zzg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/585d447e6c613b01f4e9a63a/,585d447e6c613b01f4e9a63a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qx9j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qx9j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qx9j,NA

monetary compensation for disadvantaged groups. In such proceedings, aggrieved claimants are
likely to make a variety of claims about the use of money to represent their experience, ranging
from demands for increased compensation to rejections of the entire process altogether. This article
draws attention to the communicative functions of money in the reparation process. It claims that
actors may grudgingly agree to attach a monetary value to what they hold sacred, but
simultaneously strive to preserve their sense of self-worth and to elicit identification by raising
moral critiques about the use of fiscal logic. To exemplify, the article focuses on the 2005 removal
of Jewish-Israeli settlers from Israeli-occupied territories. It shows that settlers indeed demanded
to be compensated fiscally for their lost property. At the same time, it shows that they proffered
moral denunciations of the use of fiscal logic in representing their experience and offered alternate

Recent trends for the United States show that occupational segregation remains high, and did not substantially decline in the decade of the 2000s for the first time since 1960. Men and women work in different occupations because of a combination of forces, including culturally-defined choices by workers themselves, discrimination by employers, and differences in skill levels and qualities. Research has shown that occupational segregation is an important aspect of gender inequality in earnings, and contributes to other forms of inequality as well. The prospects for reducing gender segregation in the short term appear slim, based on the weak effects of educational attainment, cultural attitudes, and state intervention in the current period.",TRUE,FALSE,gender inequality|gender segregation|occupational segregation|work and occupations,2018-07-02T10:45:13.510697,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-18T15:06:25.390000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/citation/,3rhyz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jggpz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/relationships/node/,jggpz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5856a51c6c613b0045b197ca/,5856a51c6c613b0045b197ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rhyz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3rhyz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3rhyz,https://doi.org/10.1111/soc4.12083

To remain viable in the rapidly changing technological and social context, architecture needs to extend its engagement with research, reappraise its fundamental goals and develop creative strategies adequate to new challenges. However, utilisation of research in design disciplines is still immature and the methodologies of this utilisation remain a matter of controversy and active debate. In particular, the potential of cross-pollination between designing and research requires further clarification. This thesis addresses this need by developing a methodological approach that combines participant observation and investigative designing. Utilising these methodologies, this thesis considers several case-studies, including interactive installations and virtual environments. Engagement with case-studies through participant observation and investigative designing in this thesis motivates a discussion that reinstates place as the focus of architectural practice. Existing discourse and practice in architecture often assume retrograde, romantic, essentialist and exclusionary understandings of places, for example as singular, bounded and static. By contrast, this thesis highlights an open and flexible vision of places as performances. Considering the possible roles of architectural designing in place-making, it suggests that architects cannot produce ready places but can engender placemaking performances and influence their growth with provocative, open and collaborative creative-design strategies. Having established the case for distributed, polyphonic, campaigning creativity in place-making, this thesis considers whether design computing can support its performative needs. Commonly, researchers and practitioners in architecture express concerns that design computing can hinder human creativity. By contrast, this thesis demonstrates that design computing can support distributed creativity by staging multiplicious, open, flexible, idea- and insight-generating participatory exchanges. In the process, this thesis considers interactive cinematography and procedural designing as place-making actions. This re-conceptualization demonstrates that design computing can usefully support creative place-making and sometimes be indispensable for its success. This thesis contributes to knowing by 1) utilising and presenting an unorthodox methodological approach to architectural research; 2) presenting an approach to understanding and making of places novel to the field of architecture; and 3) re-conceptualizing innovative design-computing as an important creative resource for placemaking.",TRUE,FALSE,architecture|experience|performance|place|Preprint|socarxiv|technology,2018-07-02T10:47:33.004051,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-17T13:05:53.656000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/citation/,9evkj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7mtn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/relationships/node/,c7mtn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5855326c9ad5a1004aa2702f/,5855326c9ad5a1004aa2702f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9evkj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9evkj,NA
