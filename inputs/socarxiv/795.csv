This study uses new national data (Baylor Religion Survey 2007) to estimate models of religious activity (church activities and devotional activities) and of religious belief (supernatural beliefs, biblical literalism, and religious exclusivity). Among U.S. Christians, congregational social embeddedness is a robust predictor of all religiosity outcomes and is among the largest effects in models. These effects are not substantially moderated by religious tradition, although Catholic affiliation attenuates the positive relationship between social embeddedness and church activities. These findings strongly suggest that social sanctions and solidarity rewards within congregational social networks play an important role in heightening religiosity.

number and areas of rural dumpsites for local administrative units (LAU in
Romanian’s rural territory = communes) from 6 counties of North-East region
using thematic cartography.Database created at the local scale is
correlated with demographic factors (eg population density) taking into
account the various geographical conditions between these 6 counties

identified by the county environmental authorities in 2008 and 2009, the
The large numberdeadline for closure and rehabilitation beingA large number
of these sites reflect the lack of organized waste management system in
rural territory.Sanitation services are still poorly developed in rural
areas and the waste generated and uncollected are often disposed in open
dumps or river banks (mainly in mountain areas).The geographic location of
human settlements influences the disposal of waste, most of these dumpsites
were located in their proximity.These bad practices are still present being
revealed by field observations.Thus,demographic background (rural
population share of total county population, population density at LAU
level) and local geographical conditions
(mountain,hill/plateau,plains/valley corridor) reflect the territorial
disparities between counties (regional scale) and communes (local scale)

In so doing, he compares rabbinic reprinting bans with secular and papal book privileges and relays the stories of dramatic disputes among publishers of books of Jewish learning and liturgy, beginning with the early sixteenth century and continuing until today. He describes each dispute in its historical context and examines the rabbinic rulings that sought to resolve it. Remarkably, the rabbinic reprinting bans and copyright rulings address some of the same issues that animate copyright jurisprudence today: Is copyright a property right or just a right to receive fair compensation? How long should copyrights last? What purposes does copyright serve? While Jewish copyright law has borrowed from its secular counterpart at key junctures, it fashions strikingly different answers to those key questions.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:12.061241,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T05:16:57.003000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/citation/,u5ntb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5evhu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/relationships/node/,5evhu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578c664b594d9001f58163c4/,578c664b594d9001f58163c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5ntb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u5ntb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u5ntb
