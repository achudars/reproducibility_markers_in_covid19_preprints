Coupled with a growing tendency to rely on new information systems and processes in change projects, 90% of megaprojects globally fail to achieve their planned objectives. Renewed interest in the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) against a backdrop of disruptive technological innovations, seeks to enhance project managers’ cognitive capacity through the project lifecycle and enhance project excellence. However, despite growing interest there remains limited empirical insights on project managers’ ability to leverage AI for cognitive load enhancement in complex settings. As such this research adopts an exploratory sequential linear mixed methods approach to address unresolved empirical issues on transient adaptations of AI in complex projects, and the impact on cognitive load enhancement. Initial thematic findings from semi-structured interviews with domain experts, suggest that in order to leverage AI technologies and processes for sustainable cognitive load enhancement with complex data over time, project managers require improved knowledge and access to relevant technologies that mediate data processes in complex projects, but equally reflect application across different project phases. These initial findings support further hypothesis testing through a larger quantitative study incorporating structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between artificial intelligence and project managers’ cognitive load with project data in complex contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|AI|Artificial Intelligence|Cockpit Design|Cognitive Load|Complex Projects|Data Processes|Intelligent Systems|Megaproject|Mega Project|Project Failure|Project Management|Project Success|Sustainable|Transient Information,2021-03-26T22:07:42.243756,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-26T22:07:21.149834,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Theory and Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dad|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Applied Behavior Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/citation/,pagbm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605e4c2d763cf500fd1b2db5/,605e4c2d763cf500fd1b2db5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pagbm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pagbm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pagbm,NA

As such, a prominent part of the literature has occupied itself with examining if responsible management modules are inherently considered a non-crucial element of the curriculum and determining the extent to which business schools have introduced such learning content into their curriculum. However, there has been scant research into how to apply novel teaching approaches to engage students and promote responsible management education endeavours. As such, this paper seeks to address this gap through the development of a teaching framework to support educators in designing effective learning environments focused on responsible management education. We will draw on constructivist learning theories and Lego Serious Play (LSP) as a learning enhancement approach to develop a pedagogical framework. LSP is selected due to its increasing application in learning environments to help promote critical discourse, and engage with highly complex problems, whether these are social, economic, environmental, or organisational.",TRUE,FALSE,Exploratory Learning Environments|Higher Education|Lego Serious Play|LSP|Playful Learning|Responsible Management Education|Teaching|Working Paper,2021-03-26T17:05:05.393980,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-26T17:04:48.354330,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/citation/,ek7th,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605e04ee763cf500d81b3190/,605e04ee763cf500d81b3190,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek7th/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ek7th/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ek7th,NA

In accordance with UNCLOS 1982, as an archipelagic country, Indonesia has an obligation to provide a shipping route called ALKI (Indonesian Archipelago Sea Channel). ALKI 1 stretches from the Malacca Strait to the Sunda Strait. The Sunda Strait as one of the busy shipping lanes is vulnerable to various forms of threats. To ensure the safety of shipping in the Sunda Strait, the TSS of the Sunda Strait is designated as a shipping lane separating channel. With the determination of the TSS of the Sunda Strait, shipping using the Sunda Strait will be increasingly crowded, this will pose an even greater threat. The purpose of this study was to analyze the strengthening of the marine defense strategy in the Sunda Strait carried out by Lanal Banten by utilizing the TSS of the Sunda Strait. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative research using the theory of policy implementation from Van Meter Van Horn and strategy theory from Lykke. The results of the study indicate that the lack of facilities and infrastructure and the absence of a special operation carried out by the Indonesian Navy to secure the Sunda Strait, so that the implementation of strengthening the marine defense strategy in the Sunda Strait has not been optimal.

The complication of the subject is originated from the objective reasons such as natural conditions, social and economic conditions and some other subjective reasons which belong to subjective of languages-the ethnic minorities. Hence, when considering the language scenarios of the ethnic minorities in general and the status of using language of ethnic people in particular, the selection of research subject and survey area are very important. Discussing on this subject, author Van Khang Nguyen in his work “Social linguistics” has speculated that: “first of all, one can see that the key point of the perception when investigating language from the perspective of sociolinguistics is the sociability and the variability of language.” The birth of language is the development need of human society and the development of the human society leads to the development of language which aims to meet the need of communication. Therefore, when studying language, the sociolinguistics always set the relationship between social transformations with the language usage. In our case study, the Hmong people in Bắc Yên district is an ethnic group with many typical characteristics for Hmong in Sơn La province as well as in the Northwest region of Vietnam. Currently, the language of Hmong people in Bắc Yên raises quite topical questions. For example, it is important to understand how Hmong people use their native language, national language and foreign language at the same time in their daily activities. How do Hmong people use Hmong writing system in their communication situation? What is their attitude with their language? The above-mentioned questions urged us to carry out a case study on the language usage status of Hmong people in the Northwest Vietnam.",TRUE,FALSE,Ethnic Minority|Hmong People|Language|Northwest Vietnam,2021-03-26T22:10:42.695951,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-26T22:10:17.747837,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/citation/,4tzsb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605df996763cf500d41b380e/,605df996763cf500d41b380e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4tzsb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4tzsb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4tzsb,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.01.267

Within the scope of the research, firstly strategic plans of many universities operating at home and abroad were examined and a performance indicator pool consisting of 300 criteria was created in the light of the strategic plans of 11 different universities selected by purposeful sampling. Also Reports of the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) and Ministry of Development on strategic planning were examined. In the second stage, expert opinion was received from 2 faculty members working in the field of education management, and the 300 item list was reduced to 45 performance indicators under 6 main strategic dimensions. In the third and final stage of the research, performance indicators were classified according to their importance by using AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method, which is a multi-criteria decision-making technique. The AHP study was carried out with 10 academics who had scientific studies in the field of strategic planning and worked in university administration.

To create this theoretical structural model, a study of the suitability of the indicators was carried out so that it could be further used in the selection within the model, as well as in the model’s coherence test with the empirical data and in the investigation of the factor loading. The results of the research were as follows: Firstly, all indicators, which had been applied in the research were selected and were then placed into the theoretical structural model because the average and distribution coefficient values were as set in the criteria. Secondly, the theoretical model is coherent with the empirical data as the values of relative Chi-square, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, Goodness-of-Fit Index, Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index, Comparative Fit Index, and Normed Fit Index were as set in the criteria. Finally, the factor loadings of the key elements, sub-elements, and the indicators were as set in the criteria.
