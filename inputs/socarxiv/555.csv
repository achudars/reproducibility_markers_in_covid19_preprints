It is a fundamental cognitive ability that drives the capacity to reason about state and actions in the world. Metaphor—which involves under- standing of abstract concepts in terms of more basic ones—permeates political discourse. Its ubiquity is evident in the frequent use of statements such as “It’s time to drain the swamp”, “Obama sprinted toward victory on Election Day”, and “Trump attacks Jeff Sessions over Russian probe methods”. No one is releasing water, running, or causing physical harm. How is metaphor- ical violence expressed, for instance, expressions with words such as “attack”, “slaughter”, and “hit”, and how does it influence political thought and communication? Here, we describe novel time-resolved observations and explanatory dynamical models of the use of metaphorical violence language in political discourse on U.S. cable television news in the period leading up to the two most recent presidential elections. Our results quantify the details and dynamics of the use of these metaphors, revealing how cable news shows act as reporters, promoters, expectation-setters, and ideological agents in different degrees in response to differing cultural situations.

GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%-38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99).

Yet, estimating the consequences of prenatal stress on children’s outcomes is complicated by the issue of confounding (i.e., unobserved factors correlated with stress exposure and with children’s outcomes). I combine a natural experiment—a strong earthquake in Chile—with a panel survey to capture the effect of prenatal exposure on acute stress and children’s cognitive ability. I find that
stress exposure in early pregnancy has no effect on children’s cognition among middle-class families, but it has a strong negative influence among poor families. I then examine possible pathways accounting for the socioeconomic stratification in the
effect of stress, including differential exposure across socioeconomic status, differential sensitivity, and parental responses.

The law, ostensibly race-neutral, wound up targeting almost all of Michigan’s cities with significant black population. The law ultimately disenfranchised half the state’s black population but only two percent of whites, as well as the majority of local black officials. This law invalidates a basic civil right and prerequisite for urban political theory: electoral democracy. Who holds power in the urban regime when the state takes over?
Drawing on 44 interviews, observations and archival research, I argue that a white urban regime governs without elected representation in this majority-black city. Emergency management, which shut out black officials, allowed this white urban regime to consolidate its influence, showing the deeper disenfranchisement inherent to this law. While posited as restoring “order” to troubled management, the process of emergency management in fact prolongs political crisis. But the ideological framing of emergency management as “neutral,” and black politics as “corrupt” or “self-interested,” provides the logic to blame black governance for structural disinvestment and white-led extraction.

Former American Political Science Association president, David Easton, has bequeathed to the profession a complete statement of Interpretive Political Science, which gives empathy a central role in research and acknowledges intersubjective agreement as the means for validating claims to knowledge. As John Gunnell, historian of the profession, has observed, Easton’s true approach has never been accurately portrayed. It has generally been lumped in with positivistic “behavioralism.” This essay sets Easton free.",TRUE,FALSE,interpretation|methods|philosophy of social science|political science|research methods,2018-08-14T01:36:24.960892,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-14T01:36:02.065418,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,my prepublication paper,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/citation/,cmnvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4uvqh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/relationships/node/,4uvqh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b71ff14b081040016e5778e/,5b71ff14b081040016e5778e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmnvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cmnvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cmnvx,NA

In full and partial democracies, citizens’ attitudes can influence national policy on accepting refugees. A growing literature suggests international institutions can influence citizens’ attitudes on foreign policy issues, but those studies are almost entirely confined to domestic human rights and U.S.-based respondents; none consider refugee policy. Using data from a survey experiment administered in September 2017 via face-to-face interviews with 1335 Turkish citizens, we investigate how international norms affect citizens’ willingness to accept refugees. Our findings are surprising: reminding people about the government’s responsibility under the Refugee Convention to accept refugees triggers a backfire effect, decreasing support for accepting them. This effect appears driven by respondents who support the nationalist-populist incumbent party and by lower-educated respondents. We therefore provide evidence that international refugee law – and perhaps international institutions generally – can trigger a political backlash, undermining the very policies that they promote.",TRUE,FALSE,experiment|immigration|migration|refugees,2018-08-14T01:50:25.665689,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-14T01:50:06.088443,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Kevin L Cope and Charles Crabtree,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/citation/,r5tnq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ma9zu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/relationships/node/,ma9zu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b71e3503e03fb0016d5770a/,5b71e3503e03fb0016d5770a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r5tnq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r5tnq,NA
