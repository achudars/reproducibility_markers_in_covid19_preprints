Unlike the wildly profitable Airbnb and Lyft, the Freecycle Network prohibits profit-making, or even barter, providing an altruism-based alternative to capitalist markets while keeping tons of garbage out of landfills. Why do millions of people give through Freecycle instead of selling, donating, or throwing away items? Utilizing participant observation of two overlapping Freecycle groups and a survey of their members, I investigate motivations for giving and the social norms that guide it. I find that while members of other internet-based groups have been found to exhibit altruism and solidarity, altruism and solidarity in Freecycle appear to be secondary. Instead, green-washed convenience takes precedence as members are motivated to give in order to de-clutter their homes in an environmentally friendly fashion and in a way that can expiate guilt from overconsumption.

Based on open-ended responses from a representative survey conducted during the election campaign, we train a human-interpretable Bayesian language model to identify political topics. Applying the model to social media messages of candidates and their direct audiences, we find that both prioritize different topics than the mass audience.

The US has experienced a 'sibsize revolution' in the last century, in which sibship sizes declined and which led to a convergence in family circumstances for children. Did this happen in other countries as well? This study examines the development of sibship size and social disparities in sibship size in low-fertility countries across the twentieth century. We analyze sibship size data collected from 111 nationally representative surveys conducted in 26 low-fertility countries across the twentieth century. Average sibship sizes have declined in virtually all countries.  Average sibship sizes are socially stratified, with smaller sibship sizes among higher-educated parents.  This social disparity in sibship size has declined over time, indicating convergence in most countries.  This convergence takes place for large families, but not for only-child families. Siblings are an understudied phenomenon in family demography, despite their growing importance in a time of increasingly complex family structures.  Given the significance of sibship size for children's educational outcomes and overall life chances, decreasing social disparities in sibship size suggest greater equality in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.",TRUE,FALSE,Demographic transition|Education|Fertility|Fertility rates|Siblings|Sibship size|Social demography,2018-07-02T11:36:48.269033,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-26T12:49:23.095574,NA,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WY3EG,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/citation/,zvb9c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wy3eg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/relationships/node/,wy3eg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a6b1ba43623a3000e639997/,5a6b1ba43623a3000e639997,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zvb9c/,https://doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2020.43.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zvb9c

First, I constructed a simple mathematical model which can explain the middle concentration tendency of class identification where the majority of people tend to regard themselves as middle, assuming that the succession of the same Bernoulli $m$-trials with success probability $p$ determines one's subjective class identification. Second, I estimated parameters of the model from SSM survey data by applying a Bayesian statistical model. The distribution of latent success probability $p$ and number of trials $m$ was estimated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. I also analyzed differences in distributions of $p$ and $m$ among age cohorts and educational levels by hierarchical models.

From the analysis, I found the following point: (1) approximately five trials of fifty-fifty games with around 0.5 success probability describes well the observed class identification distribution in 2015 data; (2) the Japanese postwar period can be divided in two based on people's subjective evaluations---the period of expanding opportunity (1955 to 1975) and the period of high and constant success probability, but less chance of trials (from 1985); and (3) the different games model on educational levels is always better in terms of goodness of predictions than the common game model in each survey period. However, these models were closest in terms of goodness of prediction in 1975 and 1985, possibly indicating that during the ``all middle-class society'' period, people evaluated their society almost the same as the common game where all players have the same opportunities, but diﬀerent luck.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian statistical modeling|class identification|random walk,2018-07-02T11:36:46.971530,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-25T20:07:22.468978,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/citation/,mv8pk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mf85q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/relationships/node/,mf85q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a69edb0630114000eb1371f/,5a69edb0630114000eb1371f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mv8pk/,https://doi.org/10.11218/ojjams.33.261,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mv8pk

Evidence from a UK-based GOTV field experiment on the effect of leaflets and canvass visits on voter turnout,"What impact do party leaflets and canvass visits have on voter turnout? Get Out The Vote (GOTV) experiments consistently find that campaigning needs to be personal in order to be effective. However, the imbalance between United States and European-based studies has led to recent calls for further European GOTV experiments. There are also comparatively few partisan experiments.

There has been increasing interest in studying what influences purchase intentions on online social networks in hopes to more accurately target consumers. This seminar paper will study the correlation between different types of homophily and attitudes towards purchase intentions. Homophily means how similar two or more people are and refers to the idea that people are more likely to associate themselves with people that are similar to them than vice versa. More specifically, this paper will attempt to determine which are the types of homophily (i.e. gender, income etc.) that better estimate what products, two or more people would commonly be interested in.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:36:46.350851,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-25T19:56:26.911338,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/citation/,w37xz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/52qyf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/relationships/node/,52qyf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a699381630114000db09fbd/,5a699381630114000db09fbd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w37xz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w37xz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w37xz

Some find a job quickly - others do not. Delays in the transition from education to work have been associated with scarring effects and detrimental effects on later employment and career progression. Increasing numbers of graduates from universities and colleges are descendants of immigrants. The labor market performance of children of immigrants arguably constitutes an important test of the long-term structural integration of ethnic minorities. Using comprehensive Norwegian administrative data on complete birth cohorts, we apply discrete time hazard regression to examine ethnic inequalities in relative transition rates from education to work, comparing majority graduates to ten groups of immigrant descendants from the 1973 to 1997 birth cohorts (N = 964,450 persons with 1,901,171 person-years). We find clear evidence of ethnic inequalities in transition rates, where children of immigrants or African origin fare the worst. Second, supply side factors do not seem very relevant for ethnic inequalities in the transition from education to work; as the overall patterns mostly remains unaffected when adjusted for factors like educational field, family obligations and parental background. Third, we find that the minority disadvantages are less marked at lower levels of education for some groups.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|hazard regression|Immigration|Integration|Labour market,2018-07-02T11:36:44.933823,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-24T20:13:53.140709,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/citation/,4ew53,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kfh6j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/relationships/node/,kfh6j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a68e5a13623a3000e627b4f/,5a68e5a13623a3000e627b4f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ew53/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ew53/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ew53

The Consolidation of Cultural Values among EU Member States and Candidates,"The European Union (EU) is considered a unique economic and political union that integrates most European countries. This article focuses on the cultural aspect of European integration, which has been increasingly debated over the course of deepening and widening integration and in the context of the legitimation crisis of the EU. Among the main goals of the EU is to promote certain values, which raises the question of whether it has been efficient in (or enabled) reducing cultural value gaps among the participating countries. World polity and institutional isomorphism theories suggest that cultural values may trickle down in a vertical manner from the institutions of the EU to its member states and candidates. Furthermore, hybridization theory postulates that values diffuse horizontally through intensified interactions enabled by the EU. These two perspectives imply the possibility of cultural convergence among countries associated with the EU. By contrast, the culture clash thesis assumes that differences in cultural identity prevent value convergence across countries; growing awareness of such differences may even increase the pre-existing cultural value distances. To test these different scenarios, I compare distances in emancipative and secular values across pairs of countries (Welzel 2013) using combined repeated cross-sectional data from the EVS and WVS gathered between 1992 and 2011. I find that the longer a country has been part of the EU, the more closely its values approximate those of the EU founding countries, which in turn are the most homogenous. Initial cultural distance to the founders’ average values appears irrelevant to acquiring membership or candidacy status. However, new member states experienced substantial cultural convergence with old member states after 1992, as did current candidates between 2001 and 2008. Since 1992, nations not participating in the integration process have diverged substantially from EU members, essentially leading to cultural polarization in Europe. The findings are independent of (changes in) economic disparities and suggest the importance of cultural diffusion as one of the fundamental mechanisms of cultural change. This empirical study contributes to the literature on European integration, political and sociological theories of globalization, and cross-cultural theories of societal value change.",TRUE,FALSE,Culture|Diffusion|European integration,2018-07-02T11:36:44.549701,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-24T16:53:38.528465,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/citation/,b4p79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4x8fc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/relationships/node/,4x8fc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a68a9ee630114000db02be6/,5a68a9ee630114000db02be6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b4p79/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b4p79
