This paper addresses this interest in what I refer to as the LL’s interpretant (a` la Peirce 1955) or conceptual aspect by analyzing representations of physical space posted on Instagram, a popular photo sharing platform. Using a corpus of Instagram posts geotagged within the Mission District in San Francisco, California, I employ methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis to investigate the ways individuals are seen to engage with the semiotic land- scape of the neighborhood and explore how the Mission itself is discursively constructed through these subjective recontextualizations. In doing so I aim to highlight aspects of the relationship between social media and physical place and the ways language is seen to mediate this dynamic. I argue geo- graphically tagged social media is not representative of an LL but productive, viewing the selective and subjective displays found online to be as much a part of the LL context as a potential key to understanding it.",TRUE,FALSE,Gentrification|Linguistic Landscapes|Social Media|Text Mining|Topic Modeling,2018-07-02T10:52:05.975882,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-19T23:54:38.959000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/citation/,rqktw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pmknm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/relationships/node/,pmknm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588116b7ad3c4800474d824b/,588116b7ad3c4800474d824b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqktw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rqktw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rqktw,NA

I first document trends in these transgender-consistent changes and compare them to trends in other types of changes to personal information. I find that transgender-consistent changes are present as early as 1936 and have grown with non-transgender consistent changes. Of the likely transgender individuals alive during 2010, the majority change their names but not their sex-coding. Of those who changed both their names and their sex-coding, most change both pieces of information concurrently, although over a quarter change their name first and their sex-coding 5-6 years later. Linking individuals to their 2010 Census responses shows my approach identifies more transgender members of racial and ethnic minority groups than other studies using, for example, anonymous online surveys. Finally, states with the highest proportion of likely transgender residents have state-wide laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression.

I find that both, women and men, experience substantial marriage wealth premiums not only in household but also in personal wealth. I do not find consistent evidence for gender disparities in these general marriage premiums.

Just the simplest distinction contains consciousness. It is not static, but a constant alternation of perspectives. From its entirety and movement, however, there arises a freedom of choice being more than reinterpreted necessity and unpredictability. Although decisions ultimately involve the whole universe, they are free in varying degrees also here and now. The unity and openness of the infinite enables the individual to be creative while this creativity directly and indirectly enters into all other individuals without impeding them.

Recent statistics from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) indicate that 93 percent of individuals aged 65 and older were covered by Medicare in 2013. Those without Medicare include those who are not eligible for the public health program, though the CPS ASEC estimate may also be impacted by misreporting. Using linked data from the CPS ASEC and Medicare Enrollment Database (i.e., the Medicare administrative data), we estimate the extent to which individuals misreport their Medicare coverage. We focus on those who report having Medicare but are not enrolled (false positives) and those who do not report having Medicare but are enrolled (false negatives). We use regression analyses to evaluate factors associated with both types of misreporting including socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. We then provide estimates of the implied Medicare-covered, insured, and uninsured older population, taking into account misreporting in the CPS ASEC. We find an undercount in the CPS ASEC estimates of the Medicare covered population of 4.5 percent. This misreporting is not random - characteristics associated with misreporting include citizenship status, year of entry, labor force participation, Medicare coverage of others in the household, disability status, and imputation of Medicare responses.

Past research has found a strong relationship between the local concentrations of a racial minority group and increased representation among police, as well as evidence of the disparate treatment of Blacks and Hispanics by White police officers. Using confidential, establishment-level public employment data on police departments from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, linked to Census local labor market data, we examine how department size and local demographic dynamics are associated with Black/Hispanic underrepresentation in policing. We find that police departments in labor markets with larger Black and Hispanic populations, and those with a greater number of officers on their force, are more likely to report underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic officers relative to the labor market. However, the effect of local population composition is reduced for bigger departments, suggesting a positive effect of organization visibility on minority police integration.

Empirical evidence is drawn from the Academy conversion scheme for secondary schools in England that was recently pursued by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government. The opt-in nature of the reform makes it possible to discern the impact that nominally apolitical school governors have on the implementation of the policy. Academy conversion is disproportionately found in more Conservative-voting constituencies due to varying school-level propensities to apply to convert, rather than varying propensities for the Department for Education to authorize conversions. Further, applications to convert are significantly more likely from schools in Conservative parliamentary seats that are under the control of Labour local authorities. Thus, nominally apolitical policy participants appear to act in rather political ways, which has implications for our understanding of the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:47:29.590015,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-13T23:04:01.550000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/citation/,8fhvq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tgu4e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/relationships/node/,tgu4e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58795c02b83f6901fe173877/,58795c02b83f6901fe173877,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8fhvq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8fhvq,https://doi.org/10.1111/padm.12100

Privatization, Encompassing Interests, and the Left","I present a theoretical account of the politics of privatization that predicts left-wing support for the policy is conditional on the proportionality of the electoral system. In contrast to accounts that see privatization as an inherently right-wing policy, I argue that, like trade policy, it has the feature of creating distributed benefits and concen- trated costs. Less proportional electoral systems create incentives for the Left to be responsive to those who face the concentrated costs, and thus for them to oppose privatization more strongly. More proportional systems reduce these incentives and increase the extent to which distributed benefits are internalized by elected representatives. Hypotheses are derived from this theory at both the individual and macro-policy level, and then tested separately. Quantitative evidence on public opinion from the 1990s and privatization revenues from Western European countries over the period 19802005 supports the argument.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:53:43.682798,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-13T22:40:20.469000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/citation/,uuqxg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uqd27/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/relationships/node/,uqd27,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/587955a39ad5a101ffa1acd1/,587955a39ad5a101ffa1acd1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uuqxg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uuqxg,https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.11

the 2010 ACS Match Study measures administrative records coverage of 2010 ACS addresses,
persons, and persons at addresses at different levels of geography as well as by demographic
characteristics and response mode. The 2010 ACS Match Study represents a continuation of the
research undertaken in the 2010 Census Match Study, the first national‐level evaluation of
administrative records data coverage.
Preliminary results indicate that administrative records provide substantial coverage for
addresses and persons in the 2010 ACS (92.7 and 92.1 percent respectively), and less extensive
though substantial coverage, for person‐address pairs (74.3 percent). In addition, some
variation in address, person and/or person‐address coverage is found across demographic and
response mode groups. This research informs future uses of administrative records in survey
and decennial census operations to address the increasing costs of data collection and declining
response rates.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:51:47.509668,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-14T21:04:34.624000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/citation/,pfvhu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7gc44/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/relationships/node/,7gc44,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58779932b83f6901fd172e77/,58779932b83f6901fd172e77,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfvhu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfvhu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfvhu,NA
