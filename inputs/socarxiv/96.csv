Yet, a general theoretical framework of concealment is missing from the sociological cannon. This paper specifies a model that builds upon, and moves beyond, existing accounts of concealment by emphasizing the desire for autonomy. I propose that desire for autonomy, and the subjective assessment of concealment as the best route to achieve autonomy, are necessary for individuals to attempt concealment. After specifying a dyadic model based on the concealer (ego) and the target of concealment (alter), I incorporate ego-alter power differentials as well as norms about privacy and concealment into a multilevel model of how concealment is initiated and maintained.

Earlier studies based on seasonal comparisons suggested schooling to equalize social gaps in achievement, but recent replication studies gave rise to skepticism about the validity of older findings. We propose an alternative causal design that identifies schooling exposure effects by exploiting (conditionally) random variation in test dates and birth dates for children participating in assessment studies. We test effects of school exposure in first grade for a series of learning domains (vocabulary, grammar, math, and science) by drawing on recent data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). Findings clearly indicate that schooling increases learning in all domains and particularly in math and science. However, we did not find any evidence that schooling effects differed by children’s socio-economic background. We conclude that, while all children benefitted by first-grade exposure, first-grade schooling had no consequences for social inequality in learning.

of schooling in the process of social stratification.",TRUE,FALSE,achievement inequality|covid-19|schooling|seasonal comparisons|social inequality|summer setback,2020-10-12T08:59:22.059230,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-12T08:58:58.861199,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/citation/,6hvd8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f82bbf6cc246f02e174c40f/,5f82bbf6cc246f02e174c40f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hvd8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6hvd8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6hvd8,NA

Neighbourhood Dynamics and Individual-Level Sympathy for the Dutch Populist Radical Right,"Over the past two decades populist radical right parties have become established political actors in many European countries. We examine to what extent the share of immigrants in a neighbourhood is associated with popular support for the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV). We examine individual-level changes in sympathy for the PVV using panel data, complemented with geo-spatial data to capture the share of immigrants at the level of the neighbourhoods. We use fixed-effect multilevel models for the period 2007–2014. In line with contact theory, an increased share in the proportion immigrants is associated with a decrease in sympathy for the PVV. This is particularly the case for an increase in the proportion of non-Western immigrants in the neighbourhood. At the same time, respondents who have moved to a neighbourhood with more immigrants within the period under analysis, have significantly more sympathy for the PVV. In addition, we find a statistical interaction effect for Western immigrants: Residents of traditionally ‘native’ neighbourhoods express more sympathy for the PVV when Western immigrants move in, than do residents of neighbourhoods that have been of mixed composition for a longer time.",TRUE,FALSE,contact|immigration|neighbourhoods|panel data|radical right|voting,2020-10-10T19:43:20.641124,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-10T19:43:00.634440,FALSE,NA,no,Raw data are available from https://www.lissdata.nl/ (statement required: https://www.lissdata.nl/access-data),,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/citation/,23xtd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f80c26d1f65a50235ed34f9/,5f80c26d1f65a50235ed34f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23xtd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/23xtd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/23xtd,NA

The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design,"This morphological study identifies and measures recent nationwide trends in American street network design. Historically, orthogonal street grids provided the interconnectivity and density that researchers identify as important factors for reducing vehicular travel and emissions and increasing road safety and physical activity. During the 20th century, griddedness declined in planning practice alongside declines in urban form compactness, density, and connectivity as urbanization sprawled around automobile dependence. But less is known about comprehensive empirical trends across US neighborhoods, especially in recent years. This study uses public and open data to examine tract-level street networks across the entire US. It develops theoretical and measurement frameworks for a quality of street networks defined here as griddedness. It measures how griddedness, orientation order, straightness, 4-way intersections, and intersection density declined from 1940 through the 1990s while dead-ends and block lengths increased. However, since 2000, these trends have rebounded, shifting back toward historical design patterns. Yet, despite this rebound, when controlling for topography and built environment factors all decades post-1939 are associated with lower griddedness than pre-1940. Higher griddedness is associated with less car ownership—which itself has a well-established relationship with vehicle kilometers traveled and greenhouse gas emissions—while controlling for density, home and household size, income, jobs proximity, street network grain, and local topography.

Although prior work has linked receptiveness to willingness to engage information from opposing ideological perspectives, its consequences for network formation have yet to be explored. Study 1 (N = 1,793) demonstrates in a lab setting that receptiveness is associated with forming relationships with ideologically opposed others. Yet preferences and relationship overtures are not always reciprocated. Study 2 (N = 599), a longitudinal field study conducted at three universities where students span the ideological spectrum, shows that individual receptiveness does not always translate into politically heterogeneous relationships. Instead, such relationships tend to form when two individuals are mutually receptive. Additionally, we find mutual receptiveness increases the likelihood that majority group members will initiate relationships with those in the minority.

This is particularly problematic in the case of policies that are announced prior to their implementation.

Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. 

Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have.

Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19.

Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.",TRUE,FALSE,conflict|COVID-19|decision-making|family|health|parenthood|relationships|work-family,2020-10-09T18:52:21.886272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:52:13.888849,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Jessica McCrory Calarco|Emily Meanwell|Elizabeth Anderson|and Amelia Knopf,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/citation/,cpkj6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8081a3cc246f02537545f6/,5f8081a3cc246f02537545f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cpkj6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cpkj6,NA
