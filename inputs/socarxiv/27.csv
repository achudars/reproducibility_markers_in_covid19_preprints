Boosters are used to convince and emphasize statements made. This study analyzes the regularity of boosters used in the Introduction section of Ten Research Articles (RAs). The influence of gender differences in the use of specific boosters will also be looked at. A document analysis method was chosen as the 10 RAs were analyzed as the corpus in this study. The findings showed that male writers used more boosters than female writers. Even though the number of words for the female writers was more than the male writers, it did not affect the number of boosters used in the Introduction section of those articles. In conclusion, it can be deduced from the analysis that both the female and male writers used boosters to highlight their claims or their beliefs regardless of their gender, while the use of boosters was more evident among the male RAs as the male writers seemed to be more direct in illustrating and mentioning their claims.",TRUE,FALSE,belief|boosters|gender|solidarity,2021-04-20T11:12:10.263972,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:38:58.109766,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/citation/,xh8by,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e656ec29ca802fceb61b2/,607e656ec29ca802fceb61b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh8by/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xh8by/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.33,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xh8by

Yemeni learners started to study English in class seven at the age of about 14, and this is a problem for Yemeni EFL learners. Besides, Yemeni EFL learners’ problems were inadequate syllabus and inappropriate teaching materials of English-speaking skills course. The researchers identified a problem existing in the classroom. The learners in this college faced difficulties in their study of English-speaking skills at Aden University. This was because of their limited background in English. They felt anxiety and fear of making mistakes. The study’s main objective was to examine the difficulties faced by the Yemeni EFL learners in English-speaking skills course at Aden University. The study contributed to finding remedies to the Yemeni EFL learners’ problems in English -speaking skills. It would also help syllabus designers, teaching materials writers, learners, and teachers at Aden University.

It also examines whether any gender variances in situational or perceived interest in those passages cause gender differences in EFL reading comprehension. Throughout this research, clear insights about individual differences and the unexplained variance in foreign language reading are provided. Two main research questions were formulated: (a) Do gender differences in EFL students’ situational interest explain gender differences in EFL students’ reading comprehension? (b) Do gender differences in EFL students’ PI explain gender differences in EFL students’ reading comprehension? In this concern, EFL freshmen students at the University of Algiers 2, including 35 females and 24 males, were conveniently selected. The selected materials were two tests of reading comprehension with male and female texts. Each of these tests was followed by the questionnaires of sources of interest and perceived interest, adapted from Brantmeier (2006). Findings revealed significant gender differences in tests with male and female passages. Besides, significant gender differences found in cohesion, prior knowledge, ease of recollection, and perceived interest for both male and female passages in addition to engagement for the female text did not account for gender differences in reading comprehension of their respective tests. In this way, other factors than situational and perceived interest would explain gender differences in reading comprehension.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-20T11:05:21.100509,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:38:08.685303,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/citation/,ckzeq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e63f60c818202e0512374/,607e63f60c818202e0512374,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckzeq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ckzeq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.31,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ckzeq

The research question is “How do pre-service teachers (PSTs) employ adaptation strategies to develop their professional identity (PI) during their simulated teaching class and practicum?”. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews and classroom observation from PSTs in a Malaysian university and public secondary schools in Kuala Lumpur. Findings showed that the positive notions of belonging to a Community of Practice (CoP) proved to be applicable in the simulated teaching class context, so PSTs used their adaptation process of observation-experimentation and evaluation to attempt different teaching practices. Nonetheless, the positive notions of the CoP were inapplicable in the teaching practicum context. Hence, PSTs struggled to construct their Professional Identity (PI) and had to alter their adaptation strategies to negotiate PI construction. The study concludes with some recommendations for further use. Program designers need to consider social interaction and integration within the professional context.

The aim of the research is to first prove and then explain the possible co-occurrence of nominalization and hedging in scientific papers, with the intention of deepening Chinese EFL learners’ understanding of the reasons for their possible co-occurrence. After a corpus-assisted statistical analysis of sixty abstracts selected from leading scientific journals written by native English speakers, it’s been found that there is indeed a tendency for nominalization and hedge to co-occur both at the textual-level and clause-level. Besides, a tentative analysis is conducted to explain the pattern of their co-occurrence. It has been observed that the number of nominalized expressions in clauses is inversely correlated with the probability degree of hedging, and the position of nominalization in the clause (theme or rheme) influences the generalization level of hedging. The research results could shed light on the pedagogic approach in improving Chinese EFL learners’ academic writing by making evident that the elusive Grammatical Metaphor competence could be enhanced by deepening the understanding of the inter-relationship between seemingly different in-congruent expressions like nominalization and hedges.",TRUE,FALSE,Chinese EFL learners|co-occurrence|hedge|nominalization|Systemic Functional Linguistics,2021-04-20T10:48:42.573006,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:35:20.943867,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/citation/,y4vdj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e5fd00c818202e3513b91/,607e5fd00c818202e3513b91,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4vdj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4vdj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.27,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4vdj

It also examines the course instructor’s pedagogical perspective on the use of LL. The study aims to explore the potential benefits of utilizing bilingual public signage representing translational content to develop translation students’ critical literacy, language awareness, and translation skills through reflecting on the use of LL as a teaching and learning material. The study is significant as it addresses the gap in the literature on the use of LL to promote students’ critical literacy, language awareness, and translation skills in the EFL context of Oman. The samples of the study are 58 participants enrolled in undergraduate translation courses at Dhofar University. The data collection methods used in the study consist of focus group discussions, online surveys, and teacher’s retrospective reflection. The quantitative data were analyzed by IBM SPSS V26, while the qualitative data were analyzed by common themes that emerged from students’ feedback and teacher’s reflection. The findings of the study showed positive outcomes on the use of LL as a teaching and learning resource such as improved language awareness, language proficiency, translation skills, creativity, and critical thinking skills. The implication of the study is to draw attention to the existing quality of the learners’ LL and invite them to actively and responsibly participate in improving the linguistic landscapes of their local communities.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL|linguistic landscape|public signage|Sultanate of Oman|translation,2021-04-20T10:46:06.799867,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:34:34.609446,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/citation/,zqunm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e5dc10c818202e0511795/,607e5dc10c818202e0511795,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zqunm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zqunm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.24,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zqunm

Teachers are expected to maximize the learning opportunities by meeting the diverse needs of their learners. English teachers in Omani schools are trained and instructed to modify the content to meet students’ different levels; however, teachers in higher education institutions are given more freedom in planning and conducting their classes. This research investigated teachers’ perceptions of differentiated instruction which is customised to meet the diversity of learning needs and interests of English as foreign language students in the University of Technology and Applied Sciences-Rustaq (UTAS-Rustaq). The study also sought to identify practices teachers follow to implement differentiated instruction. An exploratory, descriptive analysis and a survey were employed to obtain the necessary data, which indicated that teachers are aware of differentiating instruction and the related practices. Teachers also showed a good understanding of the type of knowledge needed to obtain before implementing differentiation and the assessment tools to attain them.  However, the results also indicate an essential need for structural support, professional development, to meet the challenges identified by teachers to maintain the continuity of these practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Content|differentiated instruction|process|product|teachers’ perception,2021-04-20T10:39:22.930947,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:34:10.579818,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/citation/,4kbjq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e5cbcc29ca802ffeb5972/,607e5cbcc29ca802ffeb5972,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kbjq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4kbjq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4kbjq
