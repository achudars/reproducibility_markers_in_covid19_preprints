In this review I propose that cultural evolution theory, including both a sophisticated view of human behaviour and a methodological attitude to modelling and quantitative analysis, provides a useful framework to study the effects and the developments of media in the digital age. 

I will first give a general presentation of the cultural evolution framework, and I will then introduce this more specific research program with two illustrative topics.

The first topic concerns how cultural transmission biases, that is, simple heuristics such as ""copy prestigious individuals"" or ""copy the majority"", operate in the novel context of digital media. The existence of transmission biases is generally justified with their adaptivity in small-scale societies. How do they operate in an environment where, for example, prestigious individuals possess not-relevant skills, or popularity is explicitly quantified and advertised?

The second aspect relates to fidelity of cultural transmission. Digitally-mediated interactions support cheap and immediate high-fidelity transmission, in opposition, for example, to oral traditions. How does this change the content that is more likely to spread?  

Overall, I suggest the usefulness of a ""long view"" to our contemporary digital environment, contextualised in cognitive science and cultural evolution theory, and I discuss how this perspective could help us to understand what is genuinely new and what is not.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural attraction|cultural evolution|cultural transmission|digital media|Preprint|socarxiv|social media|transmission biases,2018-07-02T10:48:27.618677,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-20T12:24:59.448000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/citation/,cbwkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j6mpz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/relationships/node/,j6mpz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e12a9cb83f6901d00bda25/,57e12a9cb83f6901d00bda25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cbwkt/,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00636,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cbwkt

This paper discusses and presents findings drawn from a quantitative
attitudinal survey of practising social workers conducted in the republic
of Ireland. Sampling was conducted across Ireland within a population of
3900 practising social workers approximately and resulted in 128 responses,
111 of which were complete. The purpose of the study was to explore the
role of advocacy approaches in social work practice and to examine the
relationship of professional social work to independent advocacy groups.
The study found that social workers frequently engage in advocacy tasks.
However, despite this, it also found that a majority of social workers feel
that the tasks associated with advocacy are best placed with other groups
in Irish society.  The study found that a majority of social workers
acknowledge sharing a similar value-base to independent advocacy groups.
However, it also suggests that the relationship between social workers and
advocacy groups is complex and conflictual. In this respect, it was
suggested that while social workers recognise the importance of advocacy
groups, they also acknowledge that advocacy groups do not always complement
the social work role. Ultimately this study shows that many
practitioners acknowledge
that the necessity for advocacy groups in Ireland can be ascribed to the
causal effects of contemporary social work practice.

unions in recent decades to extend organizational theory about how
categorization systems are reproduced and break down. Recent categorization
research emphasizes cognitive mechanisms for the reproduction of category
schemes: actors explicitly evaluate organizations against an ideal set of
categories. This article argues that category schemes can also be
reproduced as the epiphenomena of stable social interactions. Such
“relational” mechanisms are particularly useful for understanding why
specialized organizations sometimes manage to diversify, despite having
similar audiences. When stable patterns of social interaction are
disrupted, category schemes that were reproduced by such interactions
quickly fall apart. Predictions based on this theory are tested on the
attempts by American labor unions to diversify their memberships between
1961 and 1999. Consistent with the theory, workers after the early 1980s
came to vote for unions that diversified their organizing across
industries, but only if those unions had adopted organizational reforms
consistent with those described in recent literature on labor-union
revitalization. The interaction between such revitalization attempts by
individual unions and the strength of union jurisdiction is explored using
a combination of interviews with current and former union staff and
organizers, and quantitative analysis of four decades’ organizing drives.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:44.450328,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-17T22:30:29.820000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/citation/,v56ft,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6qkka/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/relationships/node/,6qkka,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57ddc407594d9001ec1ee0cd/,57ddc407594d9001ec1ee0cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v56ft/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v56ft

remarkably rich longitudinal data on the careers of Indian Administrative
Service officers, members of the Republic of India’s elite bureaucratic

benefits officers throughout their career. However, multiple theoretical
accounts are consistent with this effect. One account suggests that
specialization benefits workers because it gives them skills that make them
more productive, while another suggests that specialization is a signal of
ability and promise. Our analysis indicates that both accounts are valid,

discrimination? Social-psychological research argues that it limits
opportunities to exercise cognitive biases. Organizational research has
found that formal personnel practices that establish accountability for
workplace diversity have increased women and minority representation in
management. However, drawing causal inferences from such studies is
complicated because adopting such policies may be endogenous to the firm’s
wish to hire and promote women and minorities. This study uses unionization
elections to conduct a regression-discontinuity test from which stronger
causal inferences can be made. I find that while unionization is associated
with more representative workplaces and more women and minorities in
management, these effects disappear close to the discontinuity threshold.
Most of the effects of unionization on workforce diversity may be
attributable to the unobserved drivers of selection into unionization. This
has similar implications for the causal effects of diversity policies
adopted by managers.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:06.257218,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-17T20:48:14.548000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/citation/,zf9j8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w2sg4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/relationships/node/,w2sg4,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57ddac16594d9001ea1ee0b1/,57ddac16594d9001ea1ee0b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zf9j8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zf9j8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zf9j8
