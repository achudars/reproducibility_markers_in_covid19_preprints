Most of it was achieved in monodisciplinary works. However, privacy has a deeply interdisciplinary nature. Most importantly, societies as well as individuals experience privacy as being influenced by legal, technical, and social norms and structures. In this paper, we hence attempt to connect insights of different academic disciplines into a joint model, an Interdisciplinary Privacy and Communication Model. The model differentiates four different elements: Communication context, protection needs, threat and risk analysis, as well as protection enforcement. On the one hand, with this model we aim to describe how privacy unfolds. On the other hand, the model also prescribes how privacy can be furnished and regulated. As such, the model contributes to a general understanding of privacy as a theoretical guide and offers a practical basis to address new challenges of the digital age.",TRUE,FALSE,Communication|Interdisciplinary|Legal|Model|Privacy|Social|Technical,2020-01-22T14:36:42.101966,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-22T14:36:21.736145,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c78|Law|Communications Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/citation/,jvhc5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e270a58edceab01e082e616/,5e270a58edceab01e082e616,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvhc5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jvhc5/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820905045,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jvhc5

According to procedural justice theory, legitimacy operates as part of a virtuous circle, whereby normatively appropriate police behavior encourages people to self-regulate, which then reduces the need for coercive forms of social control. But can consensual and coercive police-citizen policies be so easily disentangled in a city in which many people fear crime, where some people fear police but tolerate extreme police violence, and where the image of the police as “just another (violent) gang” has significant cultural currency? Legitimacy has two components—the right to power and the authority to govern—and consistent with prior work from the US, UK and Australia, we find that procedural justice is the stronger predictor of the perceived right to power. Yet, the empirical link between legitimacy and legal compliance is complicated by fear of police and different motives to obey and disobey the police. Our modelling of the predictors of self-reported legal compliance finds that criminal behavior is highest among people who fear police, believe that officers act in inappropriate ways, and feel either no obligation to obey their commands or an instrumental obligation to obey the police.

We ask if women are especially discriminated against when they have children, whether discrimination applies similarly in different occupations, and whether statistical discrimination or status-characteristic theories best account for discriminatory practices (if any).
Employers rate fictitious candidates for either a female-typical job (primary-school teacher) or a male-typical job (software engineer). Employers are found to display a slight preference for female candidates when filling a teacher post, although such bias is less strong for female applicants with children. No such ranking is found for a software engineer vacancy, nor do we find different salary offers across candidates and across vacancies. Employers do not appear to favour men over women for positions likely to be on the career track, as predicted by statistical discrimination theories, nor do they expect women to be less capable than men, as posited by status-characteristic theory. Female candidates with children, however, are expected to be less committed to their job and work fewer hours, especially in the teacher experiment.

We define “good jobs” using a cluster of job quality measures, including wage thresholds of at least $15, $20, or $25 per hour, employer-based health insurance, full-time work hours, and protection from layoff. We find that the Great Recession and aftermath (2008-2015) resulted in a 1-10% reduced probability of being in a “good job” across most industries, with especially large losses in manufacturing, retail, transportation, and food service (compared to 2004-2007). In the 2014 panel, there is only a slight post-recession recovery in the predicted probability of being in a “good job,” and the probability of being in a “good job” remains well below 2004 levels. Although the probability of being on layoff from a “good jobs” does decrease substantially in the 2014 cohort as compared to the rate of layoff during the Great Recession, our clustered measure of job quality shows that access to “good jobs” remains limited for most working-class men and that the recovery from the Recession has largely not reached the working-class.",TRUE,FALSE,blue-collar work|job quality|Labor market|low-wage jobs|middle-skill work|recession,2020-01-22T12:30:22.754985,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-22T12:29:55.971275,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/citation/,tn64k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e266404edceab01b5831cc2/,5e266404edceab01b5831cc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tn64k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tn64k/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tn64k

Social trends in economic inequality suggest that the life circumstances of individuals with low socioeconomic status have not improved with the same rate as those with high socioeconomic status. We examined whether the prevalence of class discrimination in the United States has changed in the last two decades. Data were from the original Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study with data collections in 1995-1996 (n=2,931) and 2004-2005 (n=1,708), and the new MIDUS Refresher sample from 2011-2014 (n=2,543). Socioeconomic status was assessed with education, occupational status, income, and self-reported financial situation. Daily discrimination experiences were assessed with the Everyday Discrimination Scale. Socioeconomic status became more strongly associated with discrimination experiences over time: at the 1995-1996 baseline assessment, the difference in daily discrimination between the highest and lowest SES groups was 15.3% vs. 10.8% (4.7 percentage point difference). This difference increased to 20.0% vs. 7.4% difference in 2011-2014 (12.6 percentage point difference).

To date, the effectiveness of RSPO certification for achieving its socioeconomic objectives remains uncertain. We evaluate the impact of certification on village-level well-being across Indonesia by applying counterfactual analysis to multi-dimensional government poverty data. We compare poverty across 36,311 villages between 2000 and 2018, tracking changes from before oil palm plantations were first established to several years after plantations were certified. Certification was associated with reduced poverty in villages with primarily market-based livelihoods, but not with those in which subsistence livelihoods were dominant before switching to oil palm. We highlight the importance of baseline village livelihood systems in shaping local impacts of agricultural certification, and assert that oil palm certification in certain village contexts may require additional resources to ensure certification’s socioeconomic objectives are realised.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|certification|human wellbeing|impact evaluation|multidimensional poverty|oil palm|Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil|RSPO|social welfare|Southeast Asia|spatial matching|sustainability standards,2020-01-20T17:36:44.006376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-20T17:36:23.637597,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/citation/,5qk67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e25b2dfedceab017382d458/,5e25b2dfedceab017382d458,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5qk67/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5qk67

In addition to fundamental methodological criticism, questions are frequently raised about the sample size and data density required to detect large-scale changes in past populations. This article uses a simulation approach to determine the detection probabilities for events of varying intensity and with varying data density.  At the same time, the effectiveness of Monte Carlo-based confidence envelopes as a countermeasure against false-positive results is tested. The results show that the detection of such events is not unlikely and that the Monte Carlo method is well suited to separate signal and noise. However, the nature of the events already observed in this way demands further assessment.",TRUE,FALSE,Calibration|Population proxies|Prehistoric demography|Simulation|Summed radiocarbon date distributions,2020-01-20T17:34:01.444981,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-20T17:33:53.532079,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/citation/,bgvk6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5zbfv/,5zbfv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e25ab90edceab016b82de73/,5e25ab90edceab016b82de73,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bgvk6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bgvk6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bgvk6

However, changes in the strength of this association over historic time are largely unexamined in the United States.  Utilizing data from two independent national samples of adults collected 17 years apart (1995 and 2012), the current study examined changes in the strength of the association between childhood SED and adult health.  Childhood SED was scored as an aggregate index from measures of parent occupational prestige, childhood poverty exposure, and parent education.  Five measures of adult health were considered: BMI, waist circumference, chronic conditions, functional limitations, and self-rated health.  Results indicated that the association between childhood SED and all five health outcomes was significantly stronger in the 2012 sample than the 1995 sample, with the magnitude of the association being more than twice as large in the more recent sample for four out of five outcomes.  Findings persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, marital status, and number of children.  Results suggest that the socioeconomic circumstances of childhood have become a stronger predictor of adult health in recent decades.  Replication and examination of mechanisms for these effects vis-à-vis changing pathways from childhood SED to adult health through adult status attainments, work environment characteristics, or unfair treatment, is warranted.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-22T14:57:41.000306,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-22T14:57:14.380150,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/citation/,bhuaw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5m3s4/,5m3s4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2552de675e0e011b6bb07e/,5e2552de675e0e011b6bb07e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhuaw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bhuaw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bhuaw
