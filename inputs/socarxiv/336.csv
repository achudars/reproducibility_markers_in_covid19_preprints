It starts from the premise that online translation courses have peculiar epistemological and pedagogical characteristics which differ from those available in conventional teaching settings. The traditional styles of teaching translation courses have generally focused on linguistic competence and translation and interpreting skills with a little focus on the increasing demands and changing conditions of the translation industry. In spite of the effectiveness of online translation courses in addressing the needs of both translation students and labor market in terms of offering diverse programs and courses including computer-assisted translation tools, subtitling, document management, and localization software, different challenges remain unresolved. These challenges can be attributed to different factors including the lack of a reliable philosophy of teaching that addresses the peculiar epistemological and pedagogical characteristics of online learning. In order to explore the role of philosophy of teaching in the effectiveness and quality of online translation courses, twenty seven online instructors were interviewed about their philosophy of teaching and strategies of addressing the online learning problems and challenges. It is suggested that instructors’ unawareness about the peculiar nature of online learning and learners’ needs has negative implications on students’ achievement and online learning process in general. Online translation instructors are thus recommended to integrate different teaching philosophies in order to improve interaction with students, better understand their needs, and prepare them for the translation industry and labor market.",TRUE,FALSE,e-learning|online translation courses|pedagogy|teaching philosophy,2019-08-04T20:56:03.846878,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:55:43.737211,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/citation/,dn46x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4737913ce9350018f13941/,5d4737913ce9350018f13941,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn46x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dn46x/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dn46x

Computer-based in Genre Writing,"With new technology, writing became a skill that is being developed year after year. The present study questions whether there is a difference between paper-based and computer-based writing in terms of errors and lexico-grammar. It aims at exploring sentence-level errors and lexico-grammatical competence in two writing genres in a collaborative writing environment within paper-based and computer-based writing. A sample of 73 female intermediate level learners participated in the study at the University of Business and Technology (UBT), in Saudi Arabia. This mixed-methods research is significant in the literature of second language writing since it highlights genre awareness, lexico-grammatical competence, analyzing errors, and collaboration in two styles of writing. The reading-based writing tasks acted as a reflection of the learners' lexico-grammatical competence on paper and via Web 2.0 tool (Padlet). Statistically, the Mann-Whitney U-tests showed that there was no significant difference between paper-based and computer-based groups in the sentence-level errors in narrative genre, whereas there was a significant difference between the two different tools of writing groups in the sentence-level errors in opinion genre. However, there was no significant difference between paper-based and computer-based groups in the clauses (lexico-grammar) of the two groups. Immediate semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed through NVIVO to get more insights from the learners to explain the comparison between the paper-based and the computer-based writing. In light of the significant findings, implications are sought to create an equillibrium between paper-based and computer-based writing, along with enhancing collaboration in second language writing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-04T20:56:20.906017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:56:11.176214,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/citation/,ucbvk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4735fd90489f001b4c88b5/,5d4735fd90489f001b4c88b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucbvk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ucbvk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ucbvk

With the introduction of Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), (Council of Europe, 2001) the emphasize for low proficient students to acquire vocabulary knowledge is crucial for them to move progressively into the next band as stated in the CEFR global scales. Yet, concerns arises as how the implementation of (CEFR) will impact the low proficient students with almost none to limited vocabulary acquisition. This poses an extremely high risk of these students being left far behind as English is a second language to most students. Thus, the aim of this study is to use blended learning to expand the vocabulary acquisition among low proficient students and enable them to move progressively in the CEFR band. The mixed method study employed questionnaires, face to face interviews, pre and post test and observations to collect data from 20 low proficient students aged 14 from a semi urban secondary school. Data collected were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The study found that using blended learning not only enhances low proficient students vocabulary count in CEFR English but it also promotes autonomous learning and understanding of sentence structures. Hence, the use of blended learning proves to be a crucial alternative for low proficient students to enhance their vocabulary knowledge and understanding of sentence structures through digital literacy that is capable of motivating and challenging them to achieve their highest potential.",TRUE,FALSE,|blended learning|CEFR|global scales|low proficiency|Malaysian context|vocabulary enhancement,2019-08-04T20:56:42.267803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:56:26.368606,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/citation/,ujqma,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4734ec3ce9350017ee425e/,5d4734ec3ce9350017ee425e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujqma/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ujqma/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ujqma

It is cutting across various population boundaries and has almost assumed an endemic proportion. Its consequential impact on the standard language has acquired greater importance. This paper aims to determine the perceptions and attitudes of English Second Language (ESL) learners at Aligarh Muslim University towards the consequences of texting on Standard English. The data were collected through a five-point scale questionnaire from ninety students who were enrolled at Aligarh Muslim University during the academic year 2010-2011. The respondents completed a 16-item questionnaire. The students from which the data were collected were grouped according to their levels. The results indicate the negative impact of this new usage of the language in breaking the rules of English language and influencing their literacy. Moreover, the questionnaire results from respondents' point of view show that regardless of their heavy use of texting, most respondents have a negative attitude towards texting and they viewed it as a threat to Standard English.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|consequences|negative impact|Standard English|texting,2019-08-04T20:58:21.699553,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:57:59.177170,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/citation/,w2tcn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d472fa226ebf5001b8a53c4/,5d472fa226ebf5001b8a53c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2tcn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w2tcn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w2tcn

The study was based on the semi-experimental design of one group (pre-post application). The study sample comprised (27) master’s students of Education Department in College of Arts and Applied Science of Dhofar University. Data were collected via the test of action research skills for the sample in the courses of educational research and seminar in curriculum &amp; instruction. The study was carried out during 13 weeks. Data were analyzed using means, standard divisions, and T test. The study concluded that there was a significant difference at (0.01) between the mean grades of students in the pre- test of action research and that of the post-test in favor of the post-test. In light of the results, the study recommended preparing the content of all courses to master's students in accordance with the Project-web learning Approach, and improving the instructors’ performance to develop action research skills for their students.",TRUE,FALSE,action Research|electronic learning|masters students|Oman.|project learning|project-web learning,2019-08-04T20:58:21.651670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:58:10.648002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/citation/,efb3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d472ee226ebf50018880391/,5d472ee226ebf50018880391,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efb3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/efb3g/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/efb3g

Despite being under the 21st-century umbrella, the English language proficiency of Asian learners is still a few steps behind. Undeniably, most of the English as a Second Language (ESL) learners in Asian countries face challenges in learning ESL grammar. Grammar has been an intricate component to master due to its nature of complexity. This study aimed at exploring the effectiveness of using online language games in improving ESL learners' grammar. A total of 30 students in a secondary school were involved in this research. The research design of the quasi-experimental method was used, employing the pre and post-test. Data were analyzed using percentages to compare the results after three interventions of gamified-learning known as Socrative, PowerPoint Challenge Game, and Kahoot! The main findings indicated that learners’ scores on the grammar post-test showed a significant increase from the pre-test. The improvements can be seen in the grading system, whereby, no participant obtained a grade D and E in the post-test as compared to the pre-test. Hence, the results depicted that gamified-learning is effective in teaching grammar to ESL learners.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a second language (ESL)|gamified-learning|grammar|online games|technology-enhanced language learning,2019-08-04T20:58:41.580486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:58:25.076004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/citation/,xar32,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d472d56bcd6d90016929e00/,5d472d56bcd6d90016929e00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xar32/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xar32/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xar32
