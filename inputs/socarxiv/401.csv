A reflection of a qualitative research project-based seminar.,"Openness in science and education is increasing in importance within the digital knowledge society. So far, less attention has been paid to teaching Open Science in bachelor’s degrees or in qualitative methods. Therefore, the aim of this article is to use a seminar example to explore what Open Science practices can be taught in qualitative research and how digital tools can be involved. The seminar focused on the following practices: Open data practices, the practice of using the free and open source tool “Collaborative online Interpretation, the practice of participating, cooperating, collaborating and contributing through participatory technologies and in social (based) networks. To learn Open Science practices, the students were involved in a qualitative research project about “Use of digital technologies for the study and habitus of students”. The study shows the practices of Open Data are easy to teach, whereas the use of free and open source tools and participatory technologies for collaboration, participation, cooperation and contribution is more difficult. In addition, a cultural shift would have to take place within German universities to promote Open Science practices in general.",TRUE,FALSE,Open Education|Open Science|practices|Qualitative Methods|research-based learning|Teaching,2019-08-20T08:53:01.969804,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-20T08:52:45.829553,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/citation/,b3zf7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5aa342ffde5b0018044f7d/,5d5aa342ffde5b0018044f7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b3zf7/,https://doi.org/10.3233/EFI-190308,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b3zf7

Most of a population may know how to take interactional advantage of an institution but few know how to keep institutions going and are therefore usually powerless to change them.

Sociologists, on the other hand, have extensively studied nationalism, but have only sporadically engaged in debates about institutional politics. In this study, we bring these literatures together by considering how nationalist beliefs shaped respondents' voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how the election outcome built on long-term changes in the distribution of nationalism in the U.S. population. The results suggest that competing understandings of American nationhood were effectively mobilized by candidates from the two parties, both in the 2016 primaries and the general election. Furthermore, over the past twenty years, nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have come to define America in more exclusionary and critical terms and Democrats have increasingly endorsed inclusive and positive conceptions of nationhood. These trends point to the rising demand for radical candidates among Republicans and suggests a potentially bleak future for U.S. politics, as nationalism becomes yet another among multiple overlapping social and cultural cleavages that serve to reinforce partisan divisions and undermine the stability of liberal democratic institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 election|Clinton|cultural sociology|electoral politics|latent class analysis|national identity|nationalism|political communication|political sociology|populism|radical right|Sanders|Trump|word2vec|word embeddings,2019-08-16T14:51:01.914587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-16T14:50:45.074509,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available after publication.,,no,It is not customary to preregister non-experimental research in sociology.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/citation/,pmg95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d56bafeffde5b001affc26e/,5d56bafeffde5b001affc26e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pmg95/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pmg95

Another benefit of CCTV though is its utility in investigations and in clearing cases, which has been much less studied. Using a sample of public crimes and case clearances in Dallas, Texas, we examine the efficacy that public CCTV cameras increase case clearance rates using a pre-post research design. We find that cases closer to cameras did have an increased clearance rate after the cameras were installed in Dallas. But the effects faded quite quickly in space, and were mostly limited to thefts. While our estimates here suggest the cameras are likely not cost-effective in this sample in terms of increasing clearances, it suggests there is potential to be more targeted in camera placement that might provide better justification for their (limited) use.",TRUE,FALSE,arrests|CCTV|crime-clearance|police-technology,2019-08-16T13:37:04.058975,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-16T13:36:42.815674,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/citation/,eh5bg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5596bf6e9c70001bfe5a3a/,5d5596bf6e9c70001bfe5a3a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eh5bg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eh5bg

A Quasi-Experimental Approach.,"On February 2, 2017, French police officers brutally abused a young black man, leading to the first wave of 2017 French riots. The present study exploits the coincidence that the focal event occurred during the survey period of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2016 (Nov. 11, 2016 – March 11, 2017) in France, thus providing the basis for a Natural Experiment on the effect of media reporting on police misconduct on trust in the police. Data is analyzed by means of a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) as well as more conventional regression analyses with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. In line with procedural justice theory as well as institutional theory, the present study finds support for the notion that this special case of police misconduct did decrease trust in the police. In addition, people reporting a migrant background show even less trust in the police after the event. Frequency of different media consumption does not appear to explain deterioration of trust in the police after the event. The results of this study increase the internal and external validity of the assumption that trust in the police can be explained not only by personal experiences, but also by the perceived unfair treatment of others. Results are robust to various placebo tests. There is some evidence that the effect seems to be short-lived, although the data basis is limited in this regard. Several fruitful approaches for future studies are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-15T15:10:24.051995,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-15T15:09:51.874588,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology",Christof Nägel|Mark Lutter,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/citation/,9ad37,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tvbh4/,tvbh4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d555afcb71697001611c957/,5d555afcb71697001611c957,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ad37/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1477370821998974,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ad37
