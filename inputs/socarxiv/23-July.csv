Many books have studied the history of Islam that we can get to fill our information, but no one book is so complete, one literature with another can complement each other to form knowledge of Islamic history. From the thought that no single work is perfect and on the contrary will complement each other, the author of this book aims to present the book Sejarah Peradaban Islam to be a reference and teaching material for the history of Islamic civilization course. The author hopes that this work will not only serve as a reference for students majoring in history at various universities, but has also become a public reading as an important contribution to reinventing Islamic civilization in the past, present, and future.
Previously, this book entitled Sejarah Islam was only published in a limited edition (30 copies) by Rayhan Intermedia six years ago for student reading. After undergoing revisions in several parts as well as adjusting the curriculum and lecture materials, a book with the title Sejarah Peradaban Islam was presented. This book is intended for everyone, from all walks of life. Although it focuses on Islam, it can be read by anyone who wants to gain additional knowledge about Islamic history.
The flow of study in the book does not follow the periodization of Islamic history as written by Harun Nasution, which is divided into the classical period (650-1250 AD), the middle period (1250-1800 AD), and the modern period (1800 AD). His presentation in the book is more based on the growth and development of Islamic civilization in various regions and the reign of a certain caliph or king, however, it does not ignore the characteristics of the times and the character of the period in which Islam grew and developed. In certain parts of the book, it also reviews the roots and implications of the social revolution, the glorious achievements of the rulers, and the peaks of the development of Islamic civilization in various parts of the world.

Making the case for developing digital capacity: an exploratory analysis of Eurostat survey data,"Digital divides are globally recognised as a wicked problem that threatens to become the new face of inequality. They are formed by discrepancies in Internet access, digital skills, and tangible outcomes (e.g. health, economic) between populations. Previous studies indicated that Europe has an average Internet access rate of 90%, yet rarely specify for different demographics and does not report on the presence of digital skills. This exploratory analysis used the 2019 community survey on ICT usage in households and by individuals from Eurostat, which is a sample of the population aged 16-74 on Internet access and digital skills. The cross-country comparative analysis includes EEA and Switzerland. Data was collected between January and August 2019 and analysed between April and May 2021. Large differences in Internet access were observed (75-98%), especially between North-Western (94-98%) and South-Eastern Europe (75-87%). Low age, high education levels, employment, and living in an urban environment appear to positively influence the development of higher digital skills. The cross-country analysis exhibits a positive correlation between high capital stock and income/earnings and the digital skills development, while showing that the internet-access price bears marginal influence over digital literacy levels. The findings suggest Europe is current unable to host a sustainable digital society without exacerbating cross-country inequalities.

Nusantara philosophy is the glue of pluralism and diversity as in the formulation of Pancasila and the slogan ""Bhinneka Tunggal Ika"" means although different, but still one. Therefore, the book ""Filsafat Nusantara: Sebuah Pemikiran Tentang Indonesia"" was written to present a review of thoughts about Indonesia and Pancasila. As an Indonesian society must certainly have a part in defending the archipelago earth. The author argues that it is important to avoid disintegration due to the variety and complexity of culture and wealth contained naturally in the Indonesian region. In particular, the study of Nusantara Philosophy should be intended for prospective Church leaders (Church leaders) who are expected to act wisely and carefully in carrying out their entrusted tasks, especially to prepare to face the people and pluralist Indonesian society. Church leaders must have an insight into Indonesian nationality sourced from Nusantara assets. With the study of Nusantara Philosophy, the author believes that Indonesian people can be moved to become a figure who really loves the country (100%) and 100% native members of the Catholic Church (I.J. Kasimo). In addition, the study of Nusantara Philosophy indirectly encourages Indonesians to apply what president Joko Widodo calls ""I am Indonesia, I am Pancasila"". This book explained how the perspective of ""Filosofi Nusantara"" providing a depiction of thought about Indonesia and Pancasila. It is quite interesting because of the clear concept and urgent need for a sense of unity and unity of the nation. Where can this be a new reading source for readers before continuing on western philosophical thinking. According to Frans Magnis Suseno quoted by L.A.S Gunawan, Nusantara Philosophy is part of Cultural Philosophy by using two approaches, namely phenomenological approach that discusses phenomena in every element of Nusantara culture and metaphysical approach that reflects various phenomena in the archipelago. Nusantara philosophy reflects all things related to Nusantara  (1). Overall, this book needs to be reviewed further because it has a different perspective in looking at a country (nation). With the development of the concept of Nusantara insight based on Nusantara philosophy based on Pancasila as the basis of the Indonesian state. Thus, it will bring a new outlook for every citizen and government of the country. Nusantara philosophy is coveted to be able to find the ""metaphysical principle"" in the framework of the unification of the Archipelago consisting of many islands where this shows the characteristics of the Archipelago, namely as an island nation.

Pancasila has values in each of its precepts and is the nation's ideology that has officially become the life guide for the Indonesian people.
The book, entitled Educating Millennial Generation, has been addressed to Prof. Rama. Dr. Paulus Suparno, SJ, M.S.T. which will be retired in 2020. Not only that, at the moment when the book had launched, it also stated that this book could be a part of educating media for the millennial generation to become a smart generation and has a noble character. 
 	This book aimed to influences the millennial generation in an effort to advancing Indonesia. But in reality, it has shown a contrary habit among millennial generations. There were so many disrespectful events which becomes evidence that younger generations are no longer practicing the noble values of Pancasila. This is in accordance with the development of science and technology. This book is not only intended for millennials, but also for educators because educators are also required to improve their teaching preferences so that the current generation is not only intelligent but also has character.

Writing a book entitled Future Format (Notes on Indonesian Law and Democracy) by Dr. H. Muammar Arafat Yusmad, SH, MH was encouraged by the desire and hope of making real contributions as academics and researchers to advance the development of national Law. The book's title is inspired by the song by Dewa-19. The song teaches that all memories must be sincerely released from several excerpts and not burden the present. However, memories are not to be forgotten but will become material for self-evaluation in the present.
A book entitled Future Format (Notes on Indonesian Law and Democracy) is generally intended for all Indonesian people and the millennial generation. Because the role of millennials today in determining the journey of the Indonesian nation is very significant, it is hoped that the millennial power which acts as a pioneer can generate positive energy for the creation of a dignified democratic process (for example, elections). What millennials can do as a contribution to democracy in Indonesia, especially elections, is not to be apathetic and not abstain.
This book is the latest year (2020), containing material on various recent legal and democratic phenomena. For example, the elections that took place in 2019. Besides that, it also presents challenges to the Pancasila ideology, corruption, terrorism, human rights, etc. In addition to discussing legal phenomena, there are also legal foundations and solutions.

Character education is structured based on the values contained in Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. In the beginning, character education was considered not very important, but as the world developed, character education was finally highlighted. Character education is deemed vital because it shapes and develops potential, strengthens and improves, and filters out other things that do not follow the character values in everyday life and Pancasila.
Character education can be a stronghold in various circumstances, even in emergencies such as the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in preventing the spread of Covid-19, many violations of health protocols resulted in unsuccessful character education, so strengthening character education was needed. Strengthening character education aims to improve the harmonization of taste, emotion, mind, and body so that character values are emphasized again.
This book aims to provide solutions regarding strengthening character education, namely by gradually supporting character education to increase awareness of the importance of implementing health protocols and reducing the number of cases infected with Covid-19. The author provides a new perspective on how to strengthen character during the pandemic effectively. 
This review aims to inform the contents of the book ""Important Character Education in the Covid-19 Era: Strengthening Character Education Prepares Peer Tutor Students in the Family and Ska Youth Organization"" to readers so that lessons can be taken so that they can implement in life.
