Greetings such as-‘Assalamualeikum’ (‘peace be with you’), ‘God bless’, ‘Shalom’ (‘peace’) are used by people to identify oneself with a particular faith (Muslim, Christian and Jewish respectively). Thus, language use serves here as a means of constructing religious identity. Region and tribe specific dialects, accents and sociolects are also used to construct regional, social class, ethnic or tribal identities. This process of identity construction occurs both in the real world as well as in a virtual reality on-line, where people can either take their real identity with them or construct an on-line identity that can be as divergent as they wish. As on-line communication gains significance in everyone’s life, research on the nature of this communication is required to uncover various underlying issues governing this type of communication. In this respect, the present study aimed to explore the strategies and ways in which language and other means were used by Saudi Arabian youths to construct and enact their various identities such as gender, social class, tribal, regional, religious etc. To this end, a social networking website was designed and Saudi youths (aged between 18 to 30 years) were invited to participate by posting and chatting online on the website. Of such posts, around 300 comments were selected for the content analysis. The analysis of these comments posted by 71 Saudi females and 85 males over two months revealed that Saudi youths used their language on-line to construct and enact their gender, tribal, regional, religious identities. Participants were seen to be using their tribe, region, gender, religion and Arab culture related words and phrases to construct and reveal their tribal, regional, gender, religious and cultural identities consciously and unconsciously.",TRUE,FALSE,Identity construction|linguistic strategies|on-line communication|regional identity|Saudi youths|tribal identity,2018-08-04T02:15:20.864097,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T02:14:58.712853,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/citation/,jq2bg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k2vw3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/relationships/node/,k2vw3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6505e97e433e001803abc4/,5b6505e97e433e001803abc4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jq2bg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jq2bg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jq2bg

From a new perspective, the paper looks at the role of repetition as a separate entity that influences vocabulary learning despite subtitle types. To maximise vocabulary acquisition, the paper recommends that learners should be exposed to repeated input. The repetition should be comprehensible and to reach a comprehensible input, subtitles could be then considered. Overall, L1 subtitles are preferred for low proficiency learners whilst L2 subtitles could be geared towards high proficiency learners since the aim behind watching movies in the target language is to have a comprehensible input. Nonetheless, different subtitles should be used to facilitate the meaning and not as a final tool of acquiring new vocabulary as this acquisition will take place with repetition. Thus, the current paper could form a starting point in an approach that lays emphasis on repetition in movies watching rather than using a particular type of subtitle",TRUE,FALSE,comprehensible input|netflix|subtitles to learn the second language|visual materials|word repetition,2018-08-04T01:29:21.130658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:28:58.144403,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/citation/,jmzur,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7jdch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/relationships/node/,7jdch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b65007f2ce076001c2d75da/,5b65007f2ce076001c2d75da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmzur/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jmzur/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jmzur

In light of CALL, MALL, and CMC research, the purpose of this corpus driven study was to investigate the potential of the Instagram platform in learning English as a foreign language (EFL): particularly whether the type of Instagram post (vocabulary or grammar) had an effect on the amount of learners’ EFL output, the output accuracy, and the amount of feedback the learners received. The data was collected from authentic EFL use from the comments section of 15 Instagram accounts that were targeting the Saudi learners as their population. A total of 140 comments were analyzed (70 for vocabulary and 70 for grammar). A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was carried out and indicated a statistical significance Z (140)= -2.38, p. = 017 for output, with a relatively small effect size (d = .438), showing that vocabulary posts elicited more output from the commenters. However, post types did not have any influence on learners’ output accuracy and the amount of feedback they received.

The ethnographic-case study was undertaken in writing skills. Descriptive- Qualitative is used to analyze the findings. The data gathered from in-depth interview, field notes, questionnaires and students’ documents. The finding reveals that the lecturer considered the four key dimensions of time, fidelity, space, and humanness in its implementation. The data also reveals that HCMCL can promote students potentials of critical thinking in communication, reasoning, and self reflection. However, some points needed to be improved by the learners in the first aspect especially related with linguistics conventions. HCMCL provides the chances for the learners to communicate with their peers and other members of group to complete the tasks. This process demand the students to work in a group which requires another set of complex skills; students needed to manage interdependence with others and to reconcile differences for mutual benefit.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-04T01:30:21.250662,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:30:06.980519,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/citation/,bm9pv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qmj79/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/relationships/node/,qmj79,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64fe302ce076001a2d7a76/,5b64fe302ce076001a2d7a76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bm9pv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bm9pv/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bm9pv

Teaching with computer technology using different methodologies is one of the widely investigated areas in education sector nowadays. This research aims at exploring the efficacy of Computer Assisted Language Teaching (CALT) using Desire2Learn (D2L) Educational software, for teaching subject-verb agreement deductively at Al-Majma’ah University in Saudi Arabia. This study also investigates the attitude of Saudi EFL learners towards CALT-D2L’s effect on their learning achievement. Sixty nine undergraduate students of level three from Department of English, College of Education, Al-Majmaah University, were involved in this study.  The sample was divided into two groups: (CALT-D2L “Experimental Group” while the other traditional chalk and talk method based as “Control Group”.  Analysis of the data of both groups indicates that experimental group outperformed control group in term of the percentage of result compared.   Moreover students exhibit positive attitude towards using D2L software in grammar learning.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-04T01:30:40.726217,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:30:22.859723,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/citation/,d38fn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/djybt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/relationships/node/,djybt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64fd0b7e433e001503b3ea/,5b64fd0b7e433e001503b3ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d38fn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d38fn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call4.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d38fn
