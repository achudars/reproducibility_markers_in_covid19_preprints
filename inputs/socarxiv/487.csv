Smugglers have developed their kind of artifacts, the narcosubs. The Colombian Navy has adopted several strategies and adapted several technologies in their attempt to control the flows of illicit drugs. In the so-called War on Drugs (WoD), law enforcement, military, and drug smugglers have engaged in the production, modification, and maintenance of technological artifacts. Based on documentary material, observations and interviews I present the process of innovation by antagonism in the War on Drugs in Colombia. I present an overview of the co-evolution of drug trafficking technologies and the techniques and technologies used by the Colombian Navy to counter the activities of drug smugglers. I emphasize on the process of self-building artifacts by smugglers, explained as a bricolage of local knowledge of traditional boat building with off-the-shelf technologies and in the localized character of the responses by the Navy personnel.

A critique of using fixed-effects regression to estimate the effects of personal contacts on wages,"There is an ongoing controversy about whether the correlation between job finding via personal contacts and wages reflects a causal effect. Critics such as Mouw (2003) argue that controlling for unobserved confounders, preferably by fixed-effects regressions, removes spurious correlations and reveals the actual null effect of personal contacts. More recently, however, McDonald (2015) applied fixed effects regressions and found a significantly positive effect. In this paper, we argue that both the Mouw (2003) and McDonald (2015) results are subject to sample selection. Results are potentially biased because their fixed effects estimators exclude those persons who use only one job search method. We propose difference-in-differences matching as an alternative estimator that does not induce the same sample selection bias. Re-analyzing the data used in Mouw (2003) and McDonald (2015), we find that in both cases, this alternative estimator is unbiased by unobserved confounders as well as by sample selection and gives us a causal null effect, which supports Mouw`s (2003) original argument.",TRUE,FALSE,causal effect|fixed effects regression|panel data|personal contacts|propensity score matching|replication analysis|social networks|wages,2019-02-08T04:09:27.382851,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T04:08:24.592880,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/citation/,8ynbc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5c0cad832ca60019a9dcea/,5c5c0cad832ca60019a9dcea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8ynbc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8ynbc,NA

A common and influential way to understand symbolic boundaries is as widely shared understandings of what types of behaviors, tastes, and opinions are appropriate for different kinds of people. Scholars following this understanding have mostly focused on how people judge others and how symbolic boundaries align with and thus reproduce social differences. Although this work has been impressive, I argue that it might miss important ways in which symbolic boundaries become effective in everyday social life. I therefore develop an understanding of how symbolic boundaries affect people’s ideas and decisions about themselves and their own behavior. Based on this, I argue that focusing on boundary violations—that is, what happens if people express opinions or enact behavior that contravenes what is considered (in)appropriate for people like them—might offer an important way to understand how symbolic boundaries initiate and shape cultural and social change. Using data from Add Health, I demonstrate the utility of this line of argument and show that boundary violations play an important role in channeling social influence. Conservative/Evangelical Protestants and to a lesser degree Catholics, but not Mainline Protestants are highly influenced by the drinking of co-religionists.

This is the main puzzle raised in this paper. The argument is that the decision to stage elections and democratize is highly strategic and depends on the ethnic size of the post-conflict government leader. Especially post-conflict leaders with large ethnic support are able to utilize quick post-conflict elections to stabilize and legitimize their political position. However, in the long run the government leaders prefer institutions that maximize their time in office and therefore will hinder full scale democratization. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the timing of elections and democratization depend on the ethnic support of the new government and the civil war outcome.",TRUE,FALSE,Authoritarian Regimes|Civil war|Democratization|Elections,2019-02-08T04:07:41.756917,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T04:07:06.206140,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/citation/,va795,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ngc6a/,ngc6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5c042ae16f5500178e0d4c/,5c5c042ae16f5500178e0d4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/va795/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/va795,NA

Design: We employed a qualitative narrative approach. We then used thematic narrative analysis to identify emergent identities across stories gathered from hearing aid users. These themes allowed us to assign emergent identities to the hearing-aid users.
Study Sample: Thirty adults with hearing loss who reported using their hearing aids during all waking hours.
Results: Five identities emerged from the hearing-aid users’ narratives: 1) the satisfied user, 2) the overcomer, 3) the dispassionate user, 4) the frustrated and resigned user, and 5) the griever.
Conclusions: These findings are a first step to improving theoretical and clinical insights into the perspectives and experiences of satisfied hearing-aid users following diagnosis of their hearing loss and their hearing aid fittings.

Since these two strands of literature have evolved independently, little is know about the relative importance of societal and family features moderating this impact on children’s material living conditions. In this article, we synthesize insights from these two strands by examining the effect of economic austerity following International Monetary Fund programs—a type of economic shock—on child poverty across a sample representative of about half the world’s population of mainly the Global South. This article addresses the following fundamental sociological questions: to what extent do the pathways of economic austerity propagate through families’ living conditions and societies’ structural and political characteristics. To capture these multiple non-linear heterogeneous relationships between macro and micro traits, we deploy machine learning in the service of policy evaluation. First, our analysis identifies an adverse average treatment effect (ATE) following the implementation of IMF programs on children’s probability of falling into poverty: 0.14, 95% CI 0.03- 0.24. Second, our algorithms identify substantial impact heterogeneity distributed about this ATE. Macro constellation moderate about half of the impact variation on children, and families’ capabilities moderate the other half of this variation. We named this finding the 50-50 impact-moderation rule of thumb. Our algorithm identified family wealth closely followed by governments’ education spending as the critical moderating factors.

Participants who viewed scientist selfies, especially posts containing the face of a female scientist, perceived scientists as significantly warmer than did participants who saw science-only images or control images. Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or control images. Subjects who viewed female scientist selfies also perceived science as less exclusively male.

This resulted in many national mandates and international guidelines on OA publishing of scientific results. One of the reasons OA has been pushed so strongly by science policy is found in the argument that what is financed publicly, should be publicly available. This argument, also known as the ‘tax payers argument’ is used to support and legitimize the push for open accessibility, not only of scientific publications, but also of the underlying research data, in order to guarantee the nonacademic sector, with lower degrees of accessibility to otherwise ‘behind-the-paywall’ information, access to outcomes of scientific research in the public sector. In this study we will focus on the developments in the OA publishing in one particular institutional sector, the private sector. Business enterprises represent the main sector in terms of R&amp;D investments. According to Eurostat, in the year 2016 this sector represented 65% of the total R&amp;D expenditures within the EU28. While objectives and incentives in the private sector might not always been aligned with the disclosure of research results in the open scientific literature, there is no doubt that this is the main actor when it comes to R&amp;D performance. Within the business sector, we will focus our study in the pharmaceutical sector, by selecting a number of large pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies represent an interesting case of study, given that is it one of the most R&amp;D intensive industries, while it si also known for its shift in R&amp;D orientation, from an in-house focus in the development of R&amp;D towards a model much more open and collaborative, with more interactions with academic partners and other companies. Despite the importance of industrial R&amp;D, until now it remains relatively understudied how private sector institutions which are active in R&amp;D have embraced the OA movement, hence it remains relatively unknown how the private sector adapts to and can benefit from the new paradigm of open scholarship. Our objective is to shed more light on the extent to which big pharma both has been publishing in OA and also has been benefiting from OA publications to build their own research.",TRUE,FALSE,Big Pharma|OA data usage|OA publishing|Public-private cooperation,2019-02-07T20:17:27.915125,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-07T20:15:11.444828,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/citation/,zt6kc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5b053376653c001a26750e/,5c5b053376653c001a26750e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zt6kc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zt6kc,NA
