There has been little demographic work done on the issue of bisexuality, and this paper strives to explore some aspects of the sexual orientation. Using a social constructionist definition of sexuality, we both enumerate those who identify, desire, and behave as bisexual as well as compare some basic demographic characteristics of bisexuality with heterosexuality, homosexuality, and asexuality. Overall, we find that conclusions about the prevalence of bisexuality and the characteristics of bisexual individuals versus other sexualities do differ depending on the dimension employed. Most generally, however, we find that in bisexual respondents are more likely to be in poorer health condition than heterosexual respondents (but in better health compared to gay and lesbian respondents), engaged in full time employment, and less likely to have ever been married.",TRUE,FALSE,Behavior|Bisexuality|Demography|Desire|Identity|National Survey of Family Growth,2018-07-02T11:33:29.439703,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-03T01:04:25.082960,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/citation/,pw5eb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u46ex/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/relationships/node/,u46ex,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4bd033346836000e937ecb/,5a4bd033346836000e937ecb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw5eb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pw5eb/,https://doi.org/10.1080/15299716.2015.1048919,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pw5eb

Contentious debates on family values and same-sex marriage, increasing rates of social tolerance for homosexuality, and a greater general academic attention on issues of sexual orientation have partially spurred this attention in demographic analysis of lesbian and gay families. It is becoming increasingly clear that sexual orientation and gender identity have an effect on demographic processes and life outcomes. Although not perfect, practically speaking, drawing on nationally representative survey data has allowed us to illuminate the presence of same-sex families and their children.These findings have an iterative relationship with social change, public policy, and increasing tolerance for diversity. This article reviews the recent demographic contributions related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) families.

Access to legal marriage has been a game changer for LGBT families. Despite these important shifts, treating marriage equality as the catch-all solution for legal obstacles faced by LGBT families is problematic. Interactions with the law are determined by more than simply the law on the books. Prior experiences with the law and legal and sociopolitical environment shape the degree of trust people place in the law and legal institutions, including the willingness to engage with the legal system.

Sources of influence can be divided as external, which are independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the extent of contagion based on large-scale observational data with an unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human dynamics and the detailed approach of social sciences, we present a parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in political science--elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical expression of the county vote-share distribution, which is in excellent agreement with almost a century of observed U.S. presidential election data. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an abrupt phase transition from low to high levels of social contagion, and robust differences among regions. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more instrumental in shaping large-scale collective political behavior, with implications on democratic electoral processes and policies.",TRUE,FALSE,Collective Human Behavior|Complex Systems|Elections|Mathematical Modelling in Political Science|Social Dynamics|Social Influence|Social Physics|United States|Voting Behavior,2018-07-02T11:33:29.051260,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-02T16:50:50.946808,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Dan Braha and Marcus A.

rapid growth of new startups offering smartphone-enabled dispatch service for taxicabs, limousines,
and ridesharing vehicles. This change in communicative technology has been accompanied by the
creation of new categories of car service, particularly as drivers of limousines and private vehicles use
the apps to provide on-demand service of a kind previously reserved for taxicabs. One of the most
controversial new models of car service is for-profit ridesharing, which combines the for-profit model
of taxi service with the overall traffic reduction goals of ridesharing. A preliminary attempt is here
made at understanding how for-profit ridesharing compares to traditional taxicab and ridesharing
models. Ethnographic interviews are drawn on to illustrate the range of motivations and strategies used
by for-profit ridesharing drivers in San Francisco, California as they make use of the service. A range
of driver strategies is identified, ranging from incidental, to part-time, to full-time driving. This makes
possible a provisional account of the potential ecological impacts of the spread of this model of car

A Wikipédia é citada em revistas científicas de alto impacto, apesar de sua má reputação como fonte de informação. O que sustenta essa aceitação? Em busca de respostas, este artigo apresenta uma avaliação da Wikipédia anglófona segundo o roteiro de Silberger para obras de referência quanto ao propósito, alcance, arranjo, informação dada, acesso e características especiais, com um aspecto adicional: o controle da qualidade do conteúdo. Complementa essa avaliação um relato da experiência do autor na criação de um verbete em português. Em conclusão, a Wikipédia tem conteúdo de alta qualidade, com vantagens como o grande volume de conteúdo em muitas línguas, bem como desvantagens, como a ênfase em tópicos “populares”. Há também conteúdo inadequado, cuja contenção e reparo dependem da capacidade e engajamento da comunidade linguística que a edita, bem como do respeito a seus princípios editoriais. Há oportunidade para engajar estudantes do ensino superior na criação de conteúdos, bem como na avaliação, que é uma forma de “revisão por pares”. O bom uso da Wikipédia depende essencialmente da capacidade crítica do leitor.

Abstract
Wikipedia is cited in high-profile scientific journals, despite its poor reputation as information source. What warrants this acceptance by scientists? In search for answers, this article presents an assessment of the English Wikipedia according to Silberger's guide for reference works, analyzing its purpose, scope, arrangement, information given, access, and special characteristics, with an additional aspect: quality control of new content. An account of the author's experience in creating an entry in the Portuguese Wikipedia complements the assessment. In conclusion, Wikipedia has high quality content, with advantages such as the large volume of content in many languages, as well as disadvantages such as the emphasis on “popular” topics. There is also inadequate content, whose containment and repair depend on the literacy and engagement of the linguistic community that publishes it, as well as on following Wikipedia's editorial principles. Content creation is an opportunity to engage higher education students, as well as content evaluation, which is a form of peer review.

Diglossia involves the use of two varieties of the same language by the same society for different functions. The principle objective of this independent inquiry is to study the impact of Arabic diglossia on L2 learners of Arabic studying this language in the native Arab environment i.e. Saudi Arabia, which is the centre of MSA variety of Arabic. This study also aimed at understanding the effect of awareness about Arabic diglossia on the motivation of L2 learners. Qualitative methodology has been used to gain an in-depth view of the perceptions and the motivation level of L2 learners in two language institutes in Saudi Arabia. The primary data has been collected through self-administered questionnaires from 15 participants studying Arabic at various stages of language learning in the selected language institutes. The secondary data has been taken from various past researchers and literary works related to the topic of this dissertation. It has been found that the L2 learners of Arabic are generally aware of the Arabic diglossia and understand the functional differences between CA and MSA, but this situation doesn’t significantly affect their learning progress as assessed by their academic learning progress before and after attending the language centre and their willingness to continue learning the Arabic language. Indeed, learners studying at advanced stages of Arabic find the diglossic situation motivating and challenging, unlike the starters who were negatively affected (demotivated) by the presence of multiple varieties of Arabic as they find it an intimidating task to learn multiple varieties of Arabic under the umbrella of learning one language.Additionally, social circle and the number native Arabic speaking people around the L2 learners of Arabic have a huge impact on the motivation level of the learners who not only get a higher exposure to CA but also learn the spoken variety from their peers which in return positively motivate them to learn Arabic in the native Arab setting",TRUE,FALSE,colloquial Arabic|Diglossia|modern standard Arabic|motivation|perception,2018-07-02T11:33:25.976463,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:22:37.322626,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/citation/,f3shd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rdbv3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/relationships/node/,rdbv3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45cfe5b794960010b06d59/,5a45cfe5b794960010b06d59,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f3shd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.190,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f3shd

Critics often overlook the piece in their reading of Coleridge although it has an interesting story between the lines. Besides enriching the unfinished surface one, the submerged tale carries significant revelations about Coleridge’s literary relationship with foreign cultures and elements, the Dark Lady in this particular case. The present study intends to divulge the hidden tale in the text and to use its revealed construct to throw light on Coleridge’s engagement with the Other in his literary experience. It employs a formalist reading of the text and pays attention to point of view. It also invokes culture and allegory in the process of eliciting the significance of the embedded tale. My reading intimates that Coleridge’s imaginative aspiration towards the exotic Other is more congenial to his poetic creativity than other modes of the imagination. It also suggests that this Other might as well be the Orient. However, despite such harmony, Coleridge has his own personal concerns about his romantic quest of the Orient.",TRUE,FALSE,Coleridge|Dark Lady|Orient|Romantic,2018-07-02T11:33:25.930030,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:15:55.588807,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/citation/,rejby,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f82ms/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/relationships/node/,f82ms,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45ce9067d19e000f6a4a8b/,5a45ce9067d19e000f6a4a8b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rejby/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rejby/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rejby

This study aims to survey the attitudes of a group of Iranian university teachers at a state university in central Iran towards the possible use of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) in Iranian higher education, where Persian is currently the medium of instruction except in English language departments. It also explores whether teachers’ attitude towards EMI is affected by their university rank. To this end, 60 teachers were randomly selected from faculties of Humanities, Science, and Engineering, and their perceptions about EMI were explored through questionnaires and interviews. The findings indicated that, in spite of the current emphasis on Persian by authorities, teachers valued English over Persian as the medium of instruction, expressing concerns mainly about inadequacies in resources and English proficiency requirements. Interview results showed that their opinions were divided as they enumerated a variety of economic, academic, cultural, social, and technological reasons both for and against the possible use of EMI at Iranian tertiary levels. The results imply that concerns over the launch of new curricula using EMI are multidimensional.

It also considered whether a definite conclusion was possible. A qualitative research methodology using the published evidence was adopted. The published evidence supporting or rejecting the advantages of bilingualism was collected using search terms in the Google Scholar search engine. A total number of 64 papers were collected, among which only five challenged the claimed advantages enjoyed by bilingual individuals. The papers were classified by their orientation and discussed. Based on the points derived from the evaluation of evidence, some conclusions were drawn.  The overwhelming research support in favour of the existence of supposed bilingual advantage tends to suggest a conclusion in favour of that hypothesis. However, the points raised by critics, such as small sample sizes, inadequate matching of other variables, as well as defective measurements and analysis cannot be ignored as they question the very validity of the studies which support bilingual advantage.
