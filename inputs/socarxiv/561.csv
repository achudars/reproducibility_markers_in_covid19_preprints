First year students with a pre-intermediate level of English language proficiency, who were enrolled in the General English Language course, were assigned to work on a SPV project that required them to make a short video related to content learnt in class. There were four main objectives of the SPV project which were: (1) to provide an environment that allows students to grasp a deeper understanding of the topic learnt in class; (2) to enhance English language proficiency as well as creativity and problem-solving skills; (3) to promote the use of Information and communication technology (ICT) in language teaching and learning and (4) to provide a collaborative working environment among students. There were 450 students who participated in this project. A questionnaire on the perceptions of the SPV project was administered to 107 students. It covered three aspects (1) the improvement of students’ English language proficiency and life skills, (2) the use of technological tools and (3) collaboration among peers. Questionnaires results were statistically analyzed and reported in descriptive statistics. Findings indicated that students had positive perceptions toward the SPV projects in all three aspects. The aspect that received the highest mean value was that of collaboration among peers.

It contributes to the understanding of online learner as an agent in highly heterogeneous language learning contexts and the link between online learning and learner autonomy. The mixed-method design is employed to present data from a Learner Autonomy Questionnaire by Joshi (2011) conducted with 57 participants from three English MOOLCs with a variety of focus as well as a content analysis method was used on the interaction data in the form of open discussion forum posts, which were added by the participants, to create a frame of autonomous learning activities in these MOOLCs and learners’ attitudes towards them. The findings show that the English MOOLC participants are highly autonomous and willing to be more responsible for their own learning. Similarly, the learners’ perception of their own roles indicates a positive inclination towards autonomy. Furthermore, the participants favor the MOOLCs that encourage learner-centered and autonomous language learning practices.

In some language classes, this is done in the literature component of the curriculum.  However, in many circumstances teachers are not trained on how to integrate critical thinking skills in literature integrated language learning classes. Training teachers nationwide can be costly to a country if the traditional way of in-service training is adopted.  One of the ways to address this problem is by providing online training programmes. A viable alternative platform for online engagement is the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) which has the potential to reach the mass. A training module would have to take into consideration the fact that different schools could be using different literary texts.  Hence, the training module for teachers would need to focus on activities or pedagogical approaches rather than the text itself.  This paper will focus on the aspects to consider when developing a MOOC for this purpose.  This study will focus on Malaysian teachers who are expected to integrate HOTS into their literature lessons. When developing the materials, two important aspects that need to be considered are the components of HOTS and also the approaches that can be adopted.

In Morphology of the Folktale, Vladimir Propp argues against the separation of ""who acts"" from ""the question of the actions themselves,"" instead advocating an approach that studies characters according to their functions. Similarly, the notion of the literary archetype, as influenced by both Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, highlights the way in which what characters do influences the way we perceive who characters are. The notion of literary stereotypes is also tied to this discussion. As Bamman, O'Connor, and Smith observe in their study of personas in film, stereotypical characters are ""defined by a fixed set of actions widely known to be representative of a class."" While actions are only one part of a complex network of descriptive tools that authors may use to create characters, they may offer us a useful insight into the way that certain behaviors can align with various character identity traits in literature.  A study of character action may serve as a proxy to not only demarcate character types, but also to investigate what behaviors, and types of behaviors, were conventionally aligned with different groups of characters. Bamman, Underwood, and Smith (2014) attempt something similar in ""A Bayesian Mixed Effects Model of Literary Character."" In that work, the authors focus on modeling specific character ""personas"" by studying semantically related words that occur in proximity to character mentions.  The authors note that ""articulating what a true 'persona' might be for characters is inherently problematic"" and they acknowledge that the ""personas learned so far [by their model] do not align neatly with character types known to literary historians."" Nevertheless, their study revealed compelling associations between certain personas and certain genres and, more importantly for our current research, that certain personas were ""clearly gendered."" In noting the later, the authors write that ""analysis of latent character types might cast new light on the history of gender in fiction."" Our work attempts a more direct and specific study of character agency in the context of character gender.  To do this, we explore trends in behavior associated with male and female characters in 3,329 19th century novels.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-04T01:26:41.078467,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:26:23.580227,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/citation/,sw85m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/av7g4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/relationships/node/,av7g4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64d3897e433e0016038685/,5b64d3897e433e0016038685,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sw85m/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.010,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sw85m

China, and analyzes the structural conditions that are associated with couples' proximity to the husband's and the wife's parents.
Background: Patrilocality is a core aspect of the traditional Chinese kinship system,
and is deeply rooted in Confucian beliefs. In recent decades, however, this custom has been challenged by internal migration as well changes in family values and preferences.
Method: We model the effect of each spouse's household registration (hukou) origin, education level, and sibling structure on intergenerational proximity, using a nationally representative sample of 4,256 couples derived from the 2010 China Family Panel Studies.
Results: Almost 75% of married Chinese couples live with or in close proximity to
the husband's parents. There is, however, a strong social gradient in intergenerational proximity, and patrilocality is particularly pronounced among rural-origin and less educated couples. Matrilocal residence remains unusual, although it is more likely when the wife has no brothers.
Conclusion: The custom of patrilocal residence demonstrates a remarkable resilience, even as other patriarchal traditions have crumbled in the face of China's 'Great Transformation'.
Implications: We provide explanations for the persistence of patrilocality and discuss implications for intergenerational support, gender inequality and son preference.",TRUE,FALSE,China|China Family Panel Studies|Coresidence|Gender|Intergenerational Relations|Matrilocality|Patrilocality|Proximity,2018-08-03T10:47:25.126345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-03T10:46:43.712705,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/citation/,xzqbe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d2gms/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/relationships/node/,d2gms,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6422f3aeba2d001014e23f/,5b6422f3aeba2d001014e23f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xzqbe/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xzqbe

So far electric vehicles can be distorted by pure and hybrid, which are usually called Plug-in Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles. (James Larminie, 2012) The electric vehicles have contribution to protect environment through reducing carbon emission and pollution by improving the using efficiency of fuel and electricity, and indirect use of pollution-free energy, like wind energy, waterpower and nuclear. 

Electric vehicles need electricity as fuel, so the charging facilities are becoming an important infrastructure. Up to now, the US has about 120,000 gas stations while charging stations are only 10,000. Unfortunately, most of them are slow charging piles, like Level 1 or 2. (James Larminie, 2012) So sufficient charging facilities, especially Level 3 piles, should be deployed in order to meet the increasing of electric vehicles quantity.

Across three studies examining women’s first offers in competitive negotiations we found evidence supporting this proposition. Furthermore, a factor previously identified associated with gender differences in negotiation performance- reduced social backlash concerns- was identified as the mediating factor for enhancing the performance of high state identity integration women. We discuss the implications of these findings for ongoing research and theory on gender, identity, and negotiations.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|identity|negotiations,2018-08-03T10:46:02.209846,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-03T10:45:30.792985,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology,shira Mor,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/citation/,6zqsd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3czhk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/relationships/node/,3czhk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b63c902aeba2d00121488ce/,5b63c902aeba2d00121488ce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6zqsd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6zqsd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6zqsd

Ever since we have been thinking about the act of narration, we have addressed the related meanings of truth and imagination. This is what Aristotle designated as the difference between the communicative use of language (legein) and its creative use (poiein). For millennia, we have been debating whether there are inherent features of being fictional or whether it is simply a matter of intention, that perhaps there is nothing unique to the language of fictional discourse after all. How do we know when a text is signalling that it is ""true"" or, by extension, not true?
