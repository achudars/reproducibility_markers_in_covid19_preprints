Combining parental leave and family allowances for social investment against single-parent poverty,"Social investment is an emerging paradigm for European welfare states, often described as an abandonment of tax-benefit systems with generous income ‘transfers’ in favour of ‘in-kind’ policies and services.

The position of single-parent families directly relates to one of the major critiques of the social investment strategy. Despite efforts to improve employment and make work pay to prevent poverty, European welfare states have witnessed disappointing trends in poverty (Vandenbroucke and Vleminckx, 2011). Cantillon (2011) argued that social investment policies are better suited for work-rich households than work- poor households at the bottom of the income distribution. is critique begs the empirical question whether a transition to ‘in kind’ social investment policies can be sufficiently effective in improving employment to protect households against poverty, or that reducing transfers has rendered tax-benefit systems inadequate (cf. Nelson, 2011). We examine this in this article, focusing on family policies. Specifically, we assess whether social investment (reconciliation policies) is a more effective strategy than social protection (family allowances) for single-parent families.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,EU|european social policy|family benefits|paid leave|Preprint|single parents|socarxiv|social investment,2018-07-02T10:51:50.205831,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-25T11:05:54.856000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/citation/,qgykj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fxs74/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/relationships/node/,fxs74,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5795fbf29ad5a101f7efb4ea/,5795fbf29ad5a101f7efb4ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgykj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgykj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgykj

We provide an overview of how trustworthiness develops across the lifespan. Previous studies point to an increase in trustworthiness during childhood; relatively stable levels throughout adolescence and adulthood; and some evidence suggests a further increase in old age. Young children's lower levels of trustworthiness are mirrored by differences in fundamental motives that drive social behavior, such as concerns for reciprocity and fairness. While reciprocal tendencies emerge early, young children show less fairness concerns. This pattern can be linked to the development of certain cognitive abilities that are necessary to engage in social behaviors beyond indiscriminate selfishness. Children need to exert self-control to resist the temptation of keeping all resources to themselves and they need to engage in perspective-taking to appreciate the negative consequences of their selfishness. Thus, both social and cognitive development should be considered when studying age differences in trustworthiness.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,altruism|cognitive development|Preprint|psyarxiv|reciprocity|socarxiv|trust|trustworthiness,2018-07-02T10:46:28.345782,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-25T09:37:58.500000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/citation/,6j7nf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5b4dv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/relationships/node/,5b4dv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5795ddf7b83f6901f328b34d/,5795ddf7b83f6901f328b34d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j7nf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6j7nf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6j7nf

authenticity work may play in the practice and warrants of cultural
production. Drawing on fieldwork and interviews from an independent rap
scene in the Midwest, I demonstrate how artists draw on collective memory,

temporally-rooted logics of authenticity by which to advance their
positions.

According to the predictions of the second-order electoral framework, subnational elections should be dependent on national trends, manifest substantially lower participation levels, exhibit anti-government swing and higher support for small and regional parties. However, as subnational governments gain increasing powers and jurisdictional competencies, the potential for greater electoral participation and/or divergent and complex electoral behaviors between the state and substate levels becomes more likely. This dissertation explores what political factors and attitudes affect the likelihood of second-order behavior in a specific set of subnational elections, namely second-tier subnational elections.

The first part of the dissertation employs a large cross-national aggregate analysis of second-tier elections in twelve countries from 1980-2002. The principal hypothesis is that a variety of institutional, economic, election-specific, and contextual features affect differential participation and vote choice in second-tier contests. Initial descriptive statistics provide evidence that there are significant variations between and among second-tier units regarding levels of differential turnout, electoral incongruence or deviation, and anti-government swing. Multivariate models indicate that factors such as the level of subnational revenue-raising capacity, subnational electoral timing, and bicameralism (among others) exert significant power over differences in electoral participation and electoral choice in multilevel electoral environments.

Individual case studies of subnational elections in Spain, Germany, and Finland further help to elucidate inter-country differences in second-order expectations. The case studies further provide evidence of individual-level factors that impact the incidence of national political dominance, interlevel vote switching and participation in these contests. In particular, the surveys indicate that individual political attitudes and preferences predispose individuals in different manners to participate in second-tier elections, to focus more on national or subnational issues in their subnational electoral decisions, and to vote differently based on the arena in question. The individual and aggregate findings both point to the fact that the stakes of the election (both perceived and actual) directly affect the nature of electoral behavior. The dissertation's findings have distinct implications and consequences for broader political issues of decentralization, democracy, accountability, and representation.

In particular, they have sought new ways to reach and shutter ""pirate sites"" beyond the reach of United States law. Their demands have been answered through an expanding regime of nominally voluntary ""DMCA-plus"" enforcement.

This chapter surveys the current landscape of DMCA-plus enforcement by dividing such enforcement into two categories: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 DMCA-plus enforcement is cooperation by DMCA-covered intermediaries over and above what is required for safe harbor. Type 2 DMCA-plus enforcement is cooperation by intermediaries whose activities fall outside the scope of the DMCA's safe harbors and who are not liable for their customers' copyright infringements under secondary liability rules.

As the gap widens between what the law requires and what intermediaries are agreeing to do on a voluntary basis, there is reason to be concerned about the expressive and due process rights of users and website operators, who have no seat at the table when intermediaries and copyright owners negotiate ""best practices"" for mitigating online infringement, including which sanctions to impose, which content to remove, and which websites to block without judicial intervention.

Where judicial and legislative efforts failed to yield any binding public law requiring payment processors like MasterCard and Visa to act as intellectual property enforcers, ""non-regulatory"" intervention from the executive branch secured their cooperation as a matter of private ordering. The resulting voluntary best practices agreement prescribes a notice-and-termination protocol that extends the reach of U.S. intellectual property law into cyberspace, to merchants operating websites from servers and physical facilities located abroad. It also removes adjudications of infringement claims from the courts to the private sector, which raises issues of fairness and institutional competence. Like other forms of regulation by online intermediaries, payment blockades can be circumvented with the aid of disintermediating technologies. True to the Internet's founding purpose of redirecting data flows around blocked or damaged channels, P2P virtual currencies like Bitcoin are empowering online merchants and their customers, at least for the time being, to run payment blockades.

This article addresses the use and efficacy of Internet payment blockades, or ""follow the money"" enforcement, for anti-counterfeiting and anti-piracy purposes. It focuses on the voluntary best practices agreement adopted in 2011 by payment processors, including American Express, Discover, MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. Part I discusses the regulatory environment that gave rise to the agreement. Part II describes the agreement itself, including the merchant termination protocol it specifies and the implementation of that protocol. Part III explores some normative concerns associated with the use of payment blockades as an anti-piracy and anti-counterfeiting strategy. Part IV considers the efficacy of payment blockades, taking into account the ease with which they can be circumvented using alternative methods of payment.

Over the past twenty years or so, development and deployment of digital copying technologies (personal computers, CD and DVD burners, iPods and other portable music devices, the Internet itself, etc.), and tools for Internet file sharing and file distribution, have thrust that question into the center of a high-profile public debate. That debate gave rise to the most closely watched copyright case of recent years, MGMStudios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had held that defendants Grokster and StreamCast, the developers and distributors of peer-to-peer file-sharing software, were shielded from copyright liability by the so-called Sony doctrine (also called the Betamax case), interpreting that doctrine to mean that distributors of copying technology that is capable of commercially significant noninfringing use are shielded from liability for the infringement committed by users of the technology, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement obtained at a time at which they contributed to the infringement and had failed to act upon that information. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, holding that because Grokster and StreamCast had distributed their software with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, Sony did not protect them from liability, whether or not their software was capable of commercially significant noninfringing use. The unanimous decision in the copyright holders' favor is, obviously, a big loss for Grokster Inc. and StreamCast, Ltd.; its broader implications for Internet file-sharing practices and file-sharing technology, however, are much less clear; to try to understand what they might be, we rewind the tape, back to Sony in 1984.
