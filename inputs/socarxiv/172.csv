The demographic characteristics of respondents and the characteristics of the hotels they currently worked in played little role in their perceptions of service robots. The managers considered that robots would decrease the quality of the service and were generally not ready to use robots.

In our trust game there may be inequality in favor of the second mover and this may (or may not) be the result of a negative random shock (i.e., the outcome of a die roll) that decreases the endowment of the first-mover. Our findings suggest that inequality leads to differences in behavior. First-movers send more of their endowment and second-movers return more when there is inequality. However, we do not find support for the hypothesis that the cause of the inequality matters. Behavior after the occurrence of a random shock is not significantly different from the behavior when the inequality exists from the outset. Our results highlight that we have to be cautious when interpreting the effects on trust and trustworthiness of negative random shocks that occur in the field (e.g., natural disasters).

To this end, a self-report questionnaire was developed and validated by the researcher. A quasi-experimental design was used, whereby the study sample was divided into two groups, experimental and control. The experimental group was taught reading in English classes by means of RT strategies, whereas the matched control group was taught reading by means of traditional instructive techniques. Both groups completed the self-report questionnaire on reading skills and motivation during term time, ensuring that the participants in the experimental group completed the questionnaire within ten weeks of the intervention. The findings show significant correlations between RT strategies and both reading comprehension and motivation to read, and are also effective in improving students’ perception of their reading skills and motivation to read.

These pronunciation errors are caused by the influence of native language interference. Each language in any part of the world has its linguistic characteristics and rules that control their pronunciation and even word-formation process, which distinguishes them from those of other nations. Modern linguists described this phenomenon as verbal behaviors because, by the end of a special stage of a child’s growth, it becomes as constant customs. As a consequence, generations inherit these verbal qualities from their ancient without having any choices to make a linguistic formation in particular. As they work to develop their English language fluency, Arabic ESL students, for instance, face several pronunciation difficulties such as adding or replacing new phonemes that do not exist in the target language.  The linguistic differences between Arabic and English usually have a crucial impact on how simply a learner can study to form the English letter sounds.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab learners|articulation|dialects’ variation|instinctive|inventory|phonemes|pronunciation,2020-06-14T11:05:14.622300,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:04:29.180298,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/citation/,xjvup,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5c32044eab500a3526941/,5ee5c32044eab500a3526941,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjvup/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xjvup/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xjvup,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.33

Educational Action Research can provide a chance for the teacher to develop his/her critical thinking skills to become effective self-reliant problem-solver to the actual unique challenges that no one, but him/her, can better understand and administer in the classroom. Thus, s/he becomes enthusiastically involved in structuring and sharing a more comprehensive view of education. This paper investigates the possible outcomes of using action research in education, with an emphasis on teachers, after highlighting main critiques.  It starts by discussing first the early evolution of Action Research both as a notion and a structure.

The study adopted the quasi-experimental design, which involves two groups: experimental and control. For data collection, the researcher designed the following instruments and materials: the teacher's guide to teach persuasive writing and develop productive habits of mind by using SPAWN strategy, persuasive writing skills test and rubric, and the productive habits of mind scale. These instrument were applied to a sample of sixty students in the second secondary grade. Data were analyzed through Pearson's correlation coefficient, independent samples t-test, paired-samples t-test, and ETA squared. The findings revealed statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental and the control groups in the post-administration of persuasive writing test and productive habits of mind scale in favor of the experimental group. Also, the results obtained through the paired-sample t-test and the Eta squared showed that the experimental group students achieved  significantly higher scores in the post-tests. Besides, Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed the strong positive correlation between persuasive writing skills and the four selected productive habits of mind, which are: Thinking flexibly, Questioning and Problem posing, Apply prior knowledge to new situations, Creating Imagining and Innovating. In recommended , include the persuasive writing skills in second secondary grade students' textbook and teachers' guide to help teach, develop and evaluate students' persuasive writing skills effectively.

This current paper is an attempt to provide a systematic description of instruction and evaluation in the Algerian educational context within the License- Master- Doctorate reform (LMD reform). The present study has significant benefits in terms of researching the adequacy of applying new approaches in the classroom -as a new envision- for assessing the learners’ competences. Using a multiplicity of modes enables the teacher to evaluate his learners’ capabilities elaborately and consequently fulfill their needs. This paper is an attempt to answer the question, how can EFL teachers assess their learners’ competences with the implementation of new approaches that foster their communication skills. First, it tackles the status of English in the globalization era and the effect of this latter on evaluation. Second, it sheds light on the LMD reform with its main changes that affects teaching and testing, finishing up with speaking about English Language Teaching (ELT) in Algeria and, more precisely in Biskra , to provide data about the implemented methodology of measurement. In the present study, we employed classroom action research to assess the learners’ communicative competence using a range of multimodal speaking tasks (videos, games, songs, role- plays, oral presentations, and discussion tasks). We opt for the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods for two chief reasons; first, to investigate the effectiveness of using the multimodality approach while assessing learners’ competences and performances, second to explore the area under study. The findings revealed that EFL Teachers might evaluate their learners' abilities using a multiplicity of modes (visual such as videos, auditory such as songs, kinesthetic such as role-plays). Consequently, teachers are highly recommended to use innovative approaches to assess their learners’ competences.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-14T11:05:28.163825,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:05:11.902347,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/citation/,r2q5g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5c06744eab5009c527b2c/,5ee5c06744eab5009c527b2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r2q5g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r2q5g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r2q5g,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.30
