Specifically, how does participation in the traditional forms of social life of a community shape social media adoption? Using a unique, two-wave panel dataset with saturated network data from over 20,000 students in 56 New Jersey middle schools, we test how measures of integration into a community are associated with adoption and de-adoption of social media platforms over the course of a school year. Social media adoption and de-adoption are related to the extent of students’ bonding integration (social connections and social support) and competitive integration (related to status and dominance hierarchies) into the social life of the school, where more integrated students are more likely to adopt more social media platforms.

Hispanic/Latino children have substantially lower prevalence of neurodevelopmental disabilities than other groups (Boyle et al., 2011; Froehlich et al., 2007; Pedersen et al., 2012). The explanation for variations in prevalence are complex, but are generally thought to be related to language barriers and lack of access to and utilization of healthcare services. Previous research focused on how language barriers and lack of access to and utilization of healthcare services affects children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), but no research has examined whether these factors predict NDD. This study extends prior research by examining if social and environmental factors explain low prevalence of NDD in this population. 

Methods. This study uses nationally representative Integrated Public Use Microdata Series National Health Interview Survey data and multivariate analyses to compare NDD prevalence in whites and Hispanics/Latinos and examines whether healthcare access, healthcare utilization, language barriers, and length of time living in the United States (U.S.) explains this disability disparity. 

Results. Findings reveal that the H/L NDD disparity is not explained by differences in access to or utilization of healthcare, or as a result of spoken language differences that may create barriers to NDD diagnosis. However, while H/Ls born in the U.S. have lower rates of NDD than whites, H/Ls who were not born in the U.S. have even lower probability of NDD than H/Ls who were born in the U.S. 

Conclusions. These findings may be a result of cultural differences in understanding of disability knowledge, differential treatment within the U.S. healthcare system, avoidance of the U.S. healthcare system out of mistrust, or difficulty navigating the complex U.S. healthcare system. These findings underscore the importance of accessible and culturally appropriate health and clinical care interventions among H/L families, and emphasize the importance of ongoing, culturally responsive education for parents, childcare providers, and healthcare professionals to ensure early and culturally appropriate intervention among H/L children.",TRUE,FALSE,neurodevelopmental disabilities|racial and ethnic disparities,2019-02-13T00:52:01.724465,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-13T00:51:25.990778,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society,Unknown,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/citation/,tvbcz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c63181114312700189cb289/,5c63181114312700189cb289,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvbcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tvbcz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tvbcz,NA

The securitisation of cross-border mobility has been a common theme in examining immigration policies in the Global North. The securitisation of emigration and diasporas in non-democratic contexts remains neglected; this is particularly true with regard to Arab states’ extraterritorial authoritarian practices. This article argues that authoritarian states develop a range of migration policies that are driven by the contradictory pressures of economic and political imperatives or, put differently, an ""illiberal paradox"": if a state does not expect economic gains from cross-border mobility, it is more likely to securitise its emigration policy; otherwise, it is more likely to securitise its diaspora policy.

This study proposes a new framework, called the Inclusion-Immediacy Criterion (IIC), that better assesses the inclusion and immediacy of research to determine whether the research helps marginalized communities, reduces inequality, and encourages inclusive innovation. To test the framework, the study analyzes NSF sponsored nanotechnology grant abstracts from 2013 to 2017. We find that 109 out of the 300 grants feature research that is inclusive, while 235 out of the 300 grants have broader impacts that either maintain the status quo or predominately help advantage groups. Using the Inclusion-Immediacy Criterion, policy makers and scholars will better understand the potential impact of funded science.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-12T15:40:47.905412,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12T15:38:57.238592,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/citation/,ra8gd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c61925476653c001a2ac6cb/,5c61925476653c001a2ac6cb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra8gd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ra8gd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ra8gd,NA

The ability to be flexible is affected by a wide variety of sociotechnical factors and determines what we term ‘flexibility capital’. Levels of flexibility capital vary in populations, both absolutely and in the extent to which they are primarily derived from technological or social means, which has implications for the (dis)comfort and (in)convenience involved in economising flexibility capital. Furthermore, we argue that freedom of choice over whether and how to economise flexibility capital can be limited by factors such as financial resources, among others. In constrained systems (such as energy networks), the level of service enjoyed by the more affluent may not simply be higher than those who are less affluent, but may be directly enabled by reductions in the latter’s comfort and/or convenience which may not feel fully voluntary. There is a real risk that such injustices could be locked into energy infrastructure and market design and governance for the long term as has already happened in labour markets. We introduce the concept of ‘flexibility justice’ as a frame for these issues of fairness. While the concepts we offer in the paper emerge from longstanding engagements with energy research contexts and they relate directly to the issues currently being debated in the energy research and policy communities, we contend that they can be related to a much broader range of issues in 21st century economies.",TRUE,FALSE,capital|energy|flexibility|justice,2019-02-12T15:42:50.261261,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12T15:40:09.268024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/citation/,3nja6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gv2ex/,gv2ex,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c618e9be16f55001792dc13/,5c618e9be16f55001792dc13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3nja6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3nja6,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.03.015

Contradictory information arise often depending on metadata employed. We strive to assign OA status to publications in Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus while complementing it with different sources
of OA information to resolve contradicting cases. We linked publications from WOS and Scopus via DOIs and ISSNs to Unpaywall, Crossref, DOAJ and ROAD. Only about 70% of articles and reviews from WOS and Scopus could be matched via a DOI to Unpaywall. Matching with Crossref brought 53 distinct licences, which define in many cases the legally binding access status of publications. But only 53% of publications hold only a single licence on Crossref, while more than 42% have no licence information submitted to Crossref. Contrasting OA information from Crossref licences with Unpaywall we found contradictory cases overall amounting to more than 13%, which might be partially explained by (ex-)including green OA. A further manual check found about 17% of OA publications that are not accessible and about 15% non-OA publications that are accessible through publishers’ websites. These preliminary results suggest that identification of OA state of publications denotes a difficult and currently unfulfilled task.",TRUE,FALSE,Crossref|DZHW|Open Access|Open Science|Scopus|Unpaywall|Web Of Science,2019-02-12T15:38:41.886303,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12T15:37:21.228627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/citation/,npj4h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6186e1832ca6001aac7aab/,5c6186e1832ca6001aac7aab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npj4h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npj4h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npj4h,NA
