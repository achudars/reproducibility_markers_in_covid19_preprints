A large-scale audit experiment among street-level bureaucrats,"Despite growing descriptive evidence of discrimination against minority religious groups and atheists in the United States, little experimental work exists studying whether individuals face differential barriers to receiving public services depending on their religious affiliation. Here we report results from a large-scale audit study of street-level bureaucrats in the American public school system. We emailed the principals of more than 45,000 public schools and asked for a meeting, randomly assigning the religious affiliation/non-affiliation of the family. To get at potential mechanisms, we also randomly assigned belief intensity.
We find evidence of substantial discrimination against Muslims and atheists. These individuals are substantially less likely to receive a response, with discrimination growing when they signal that their beliefs are more intense.

In this paper we incorporate both processes to shed a new light on a classic concern in the sociology of stratification: how are adolescents’ aspirations, expectations, and school performance shaped by the combined socioeconomic contexts of family, school and neighborhood life? Theoretically, social contexts provide children with cultural resources that may foster their ambitions and bolster their academic performance. Reference group theory instead highlights how seemingly positive settings can depress educational performance as well as aspirations and expectations. We empirically test these competing claims, drawing on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) which describes the school and neighborhood trajectories of 7,934 British children followed from birth to adolescence. We find that, generally, childhood school and neighborhood deprivation is negatively associated with adolescents’ school performance, aspirations and expectations for their future, in line with the cultural resource perspective. However, there are important exceptions to this pattern which point to reference group processes for (1) children of highly-educated parents, whose academic performance especially suffers from growing up in a poor neighborhood, and (2) for children from low-educated parents, whose academic aspirations and expectations are unexpectedly high when they either went to an affluent school or lived in an affluent neighborhood—but not both.

Most of them are created by professionals in the fields of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive medicine and spread widely through a mass media campaign backed by academic associations. Such a knowledge has also been used by the government as scientific evidence to justify encouragement of pregnancy and childbirth for young women.

“Egg aging” (卵子の老化) has been the key concept in the campaign. This concept is originally a term of biology for the degeneration of eggs (or female germ cells) owing to a long delay in the process of meiotic division. As it acquired popularity, the concept widened its connotation. “Egg aging” today is not limited to the degeneration of germ cells, but covers a wide range of fertility problems experienced by women of an advanced age. It now serves as a magic phrase to represent many aspects of latent biological mechanisms of declining fertility.

In the course of the media campaign, fake knowledge about human reproduction has become popular in books, magazines, and websites giving an impression that it is based on scientific grounds. These are targeted at youths' perception of their body and thereby have an impact on their sexual behavior and family planning. We can regard this as a violation against reproductive rights because it disrupts the reproductive decision-making process with misinformation. It also damages public trust in the medical profession, which will eventually harm the social health system.

This brochure, Unscientific Visual Representations Used for the Egg Aging Campaign in 2010s Japan, is a product of the research project “Unscientific knowledge and the egg aging panic” funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI #17K02069 for fiscal 2017-2019). This project is run by Tanaka Sigeto, an associate professor at Tohoku University, to explore the courses, contexts, and consequences of the egg aging campaign.

Persons engaged in the sex industry are at greater risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections than the general population. One major factor is exposure to higher levels of risky sexual activity. Expanding condom use is a critical prevention strategy, but this requires negotiation with those buying sex, which takes place in the context of cultural and economic constraints. Impoverished individuals who fear violence are more likely to forego condoms.

Methods
Here we tested the hypotheses that poverty and fear of violence are two structural drivers of HIV infection risk in the sex industry. Using data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Bank for 30 countries, we evaluated poverty, measured using the average income per day per person in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, and gender violence, measured using homicide rates in women and the proportion of women exposed to violence in the last 12 months and/or since age 16 years.

Results
We found that HIV prevalence among those in the sex industry was higher in countries where there were greater female homicide rates (β = 0.86; P = 0.018) and there was some evidence that self‐reported exposure to violence was also associated with higher HIV prevalence (β = 1.37; P = 0.043). Conversely, HIV prevalence was lower in countries where average incomes among the poorest were greater (β = −1.05; P = 0.046).

Conclusions
Our results are consistent with the theory that reducing poverty and exposure to violence may help reduce HIV infection risk among persons engaged in the sex industry.",TRUE,FALSE,gender violence|HIV|poverty,2018-08-10T14:34:41.096085,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T14:34:20.791116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/citation/,gm8w2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6y4e8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/relationships/node/,6y4e8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6d8ea152fa4200195c658c/,5b6d8ea152fa4200195c658c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gm8w2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gm8w2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gm8w2,https://doi.org/10.1111/hiv.12520

Sex workers are disproportionately affected by HIV compared with the general population. Most studies of HIV risk among sex workers have focused on individual-level risk factors, with few studies assessing potential structural determinants of HIV risk. In this Article, we examine whether criminal laws around sex work are associated with HIV prevalence among female sex workers.
Method
We estimate cross-sectional, ecological regression models with data from 27 European countries on HIV prevalence among sex workers from the European Centre for Disease Control; sex-work legislation from the US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and country-specific legal documents; the rule of law and gross-domestic product per capita, adjusted for purchasing power, from the World Bank; and the prevalence of injecting drug use among sex workers. Although data from two countries include male sex workers, the numbers are so small that the findings here essentially pertain to prevalence in female sex workers.
Findings
Countries that have legalised some aspects of sex work (n=17) have significantly lower HIV prevalence among sex workers than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work (n=10; β=–2·09, 95% CI −0·80 to −3·37; p=0·003), even after controlling for the level of economic development (β=–1·86; p=0·038) and the proportion of sex workers who are injecting drug users (−1·93; p=0·026). We found that the relation between sex work policy and HIV among sex workers might be partly moderated by the effectiveness and fairness of enforcement, suggesting legalisation of some aspects of sex work could reduce HIV among sex workers to the greatest extent in countries where enforcement is fair and effective.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that the legalisation of some aspects of sex work might help reduce HIV prevalence in this high-risk group, particularly in countries where the judiciary is effective and fair.",TRUE,FALSE,HIV|legalization|sex work,2018-08-10T14:34:21.863551,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T14:34:06.408034,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/citation/,5twqv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9uz7s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/relationships/node/,9uz7s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6d8dbabb82f50019be9b48/,5b6d8dbabb82f50019be9b48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5twqv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5twqv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5twqv,https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-3018(16)30217-X

Drawing on data from the World Health Organization for 62 countries, covering the period 2000–2014, we explore whether economic (risk of expropriation) and health (complete cause of death registries) institutions explain mortality rates and access to healthcare. To identify this relationship, we use settler mortality and the distance of the capital from the nearest major port – factors associated with institutional arrangements – to explain cross-national variation in health outcomes and the universality of health systems. We find that inclusive institutions arrangements – that protect and acknowledge the rights of citizens – are associated with better health outcomes (e.g. lower infant mortality and lower maternal mortality) as well as with better health systems (e.g. more skilled birth attendance and greater immunization). Inclusive institutions not only foster economic growth but improve health and well-being too.",TRUE,FALSE,colonialism|health|Institutions|UHC,2018-08-10T13:18:01.558311,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T13:17:50.276106,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/citation/,vf46t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y85uq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/relationships/node/,y85uq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6d8938bb82f50019be97da/,5b6d8938bb82f50019be97da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf46t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vf46t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vf46t,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.07.010

The data source was the 2015 Public Library Service data and reports, and a multiple regression model was used to analyze the data in the R programming language. Results indicated that the best variables for predicating VISITS were a library’s total operating expenditures, usage of public Internet-enabled computers per year, audio-physical units, total children programs, and video-physical units.
