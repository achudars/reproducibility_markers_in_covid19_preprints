How many of the top 1 and 10 per cent are women? A great deal is known about gender differentials in earnings, but how far does this carry over to the distribution of total incomes, bringing self-employment and capital income into the picture? We investigate the gender divide at the top of the income distribution using tax record data for a sample of eight countries with individual taxation. We show that women are under-represented at the top of the distribution. They account for between a fifth and a third of those in the top 10 per cent. Higher up the income distribution, the proportion is lower, with women constituting between 14 and 22 per cent of the top 1 per cent. The presence of women in the top income groups has generally increased over time, but the rise becomes smaller at the very top. As a result, the gradient with income has become more marked: the under-representation of women today increases more sharply. Examination of the shape of the income distribution by fitting a Pareto distribution shows that at the end of the period women disappear faster than men as one moves up the income scale in all countries. In this sense, there appears to be something of a ""glass ceiling"" for women. In the case of Canada, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand, there appears to have been a reversal over time, with the slope of the upper tail having been steeper for women in the past. In seeking to explain this, we highlight the role of income composition, where we show that there have been significant changes over time, underlining the fact that it is not sufficient to look only at earned income.",TRUE,FALSE,III|IIIWP|Inequalities|Inequality|Institute|International|LSE|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:23.556274,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-19T13:33:21.449000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/citation/,534e4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r6kek/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/relationships/node/,r6kek,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/580776239ad5a101f179453e/,580776239ad5a101f179453e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/534e4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/534e4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/534e4,NA

One reason is the growing recognition that, in seeking explanations for rising income inequality, we need to look not only at wages and earned income but also at income from capital, particularly at the top of the distribution. In this paper, we use evidence from existing data sources to attempt to answer three questions: (i) what is the share of total personal wealth that is owned by the top 1 per cent, or the top 0.1 per cent? (ii) is wealth much more unequally distributed than income? (iii) is the concentration of wealth at the top increasing over time?

It explores his interests in expanding databases on wealth and income, and in analysing inequality at different spatial scales, including cities, regions, and global processes. The interview discusses his understanding of new elites and their relationship with older elites, and clarifies his understanding of social class and inheritance. It includes discussions on his relationship with the discipline of economics and with the social sciences more generally. It reflects on conceptual issues, including his theoretical interests in Bourdieu and Marx, and his relationship to socialist theory and politics. His new role in the LSE's International Inequalities Institute is also discussed.

women) when they apply to jobs in the United States. A field experiment was
conducted in which a pair of fictitious women’s résumés were sent to apply
to more than 800 administrative jobs from online job databases advertised
by employers across four states. One woman’s résumé was randomly assigned
leadership experience at a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
student organization to signal queer identity, while the other résumé, a

organization. Results reveal that the women with the LGBT indicator on

    The Flint water crisis is a story of government failure at all levels. By studying microblog posts about it, we understand how citizens assign responsibility and blame regarding such a man-made disaster online. We form hypotheses based on social scientific theories in disaster research and then operationalize them on unobtrusive, observational social media data. In particular, we investigate the following phenomena: the source for blame; the partisan predisposition; the concerned geographies; and the contagion of complaining.

    This paper adds to the sociology of disasters research by exploiting a new, rarely used data source (the social web), and by employing new computational methods (such as sentiment analysis and retrospective cohort study design) on this new form of data. In this regard, this work should be seen as the first step toward drawing more challenging inferences on the sociology of disasters from ""big social data"".",TRUE,FALSE,attribution of blame and responsibility|computational social science|Flint water crisis|preprint|socarxiv|social media research|sociology of disasters|SWDM,2018-07-02T10:51:10.985978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-11T18:41:51.202000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/citation/,m6jnh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/keszj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/relationships/node/,keszj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57fd2f4bb83f6901d7362806/,57fd2f4bb83f6901d7362806,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6jnh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m6jnh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m6jnh,NA
