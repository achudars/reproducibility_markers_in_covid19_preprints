Attempts to substantiate this assumption offer sparse confirmatory evidence. Therefore, this research brings the most data and comprehensive measurement models thus far to investigate a single underlying attitude. The data from 1986-2017 in 43 countries suggests a latent ideal role attitude; however, measurement varies somewhat by historical institutions and levels of development across societies. At first the data seem to fail metric invariance tests as a first step in establishing the latent attitude. When applying corrections for a potential second attitude toward social insurance, and allowing for diverse effects of GDP, socialism or Communist authoritarian institutional legacies, metric invariance comes into focus and explains the data to a degree that most critics find acceptable.",TRUE,FALSE,ISSP|MGCFA|Public Opinion|Social Policy Preferences|Welfare State Attitudes,2018-11-10T13:30:01.182476,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-10T13:29:34.597413,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/citation/,euwty,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8j3va/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/relationships/node/,8j3va,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be458930fa9f5001ab48615/,5be458930fa9f5001ab48615,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwty/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/euwty/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207659.2019.1605028,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/euwty

This paper ventured on the analysis of the prevalence and perceived consequences of early marriage on school enrollment completion and academic performance of female students in senior secondary schools in the North-East Geo-political zone, Nigeria. The objective of the study is to determine the major effects of early marriage on female youth educational development. Ex-post facto design was used for the study. Three hundred and fifty four (354) females’ students for 2015/2016 session constituted sample respondents for the study. They responded to prevalence and perceived consequences of early marriage questionnaire (PCEMQ) while the sample of female student senior secondary school certificate (SSCE) qualifying examination results for the 2015/2016 session was used for the analysis of student academic achievement in English, Mathematics and Biology. The data were analyzed with the statistical package for social science (SPSS) using t-test of inferential statistics i-e. T-test of dependent and independent sample to determine the significance different between the variables on enrolment, completion and academic performance. The major finding revealed that, there was significant different in enrolment completion and academic performance of early marriage students and those married at a later age. It was further recommended that, there is need for a reform in laws discouraging early/force marriage in the country. Also guidance and counselling should be introduced in all schools, and parents should delay marriage of their daughters until at a later age.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-11-10T13:29:01.372427,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-10T13:28:45.206266,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/citation/,5rqy7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ma4ch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/relationships/node/,ma4ch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be453110fa9f50019b5f6dd/,5be453110fa9f50019b5f6dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5rqy7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5rqy7

Today goats are mainly kept for surplus purposes, while sheep and yak are kept for subsistence purposes. The implementation of the new economic reform policy in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) by the end of the Cultural Revolution brought the nomads in TAR closer to a market economy, and the Aru nomads are now dependent on a production that both can create a surplus to provide them with a cash income and a production that can provide them with subsistence goods. This change has resulted in a change of herd and sex composition in the nomads’ herds, of importance being a larger number of goats, and a larger number of male animals. The increasing importance of cashmere wool can be viewed as giving the Aru nomads new opportunities instead of decreasing their choices. However, this change in economic patterns can have long-term negative consequences for the pastoral system, where an increase in goat numbers might exacerbate rangeland degradation and a decrease in number of female animals in herds might have consequences for the growth potential of the herds. Consequently, herds with large proportions of adult male animals will be more affected by climatic perturbations, and the recuperation potential for herds will be decreased.",TRUE,FALSE,cashmere wool|Chang Tang (Tib.: byang thang)|China|goats|nomadic pastoralism|overgrazing|production|risk,2018-11-08T17:26:44.976608,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-08T17:25:49.940436,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,Marius Warg Næss,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/citation/,mb7v5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fnhm9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/relationships/node/,fnhm9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be41ea60fa9f5001ab442d3/,5be41ea60fa9f5001ab442d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mb7v5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mb7v5

The “scripted approach,” used to effect the routine removal of noncitizens in most of the completed cases observed, entails judges’ recitation of well-rehearsed narratives regarding the limited legal rights and remedies available to noncitizens. The “extemporaneous approach” involves judges moving beyond their scripts and deliberating in greater depth about noncitizens’ cases. In doing so, judges’ personal attitudes, biases, and motivations are often revealed as they articulate their desire to circumvent the removal process for noncitizens they view as “deserving” of relief—but for whom only temporary relief from removal is often available given judges’ interpretations of immigration law. Although judges recognize that this temporary relief may allow some noncitizens to remain in the United States indefinitely, incomplete protection from removal can leave noncitizens in a precarious legal status and jeopardize these individuals' future opportunities for legalization. These findings support a conceptualization of immigration judges as street-level bureaucrats, or frontline workers who interpret the law—sometimes unevenly—in order to enforce government policy while interfacing with the individuals subject to said policy, and amplify the social control capacity of the federal immigration regime.",TRUE,FALSE,Dallas|decision-making|deportation|ethnography|immigration judges|immigration law|removal|street-level bureaucrats|Texas|United States,2018-11-08T17:23:41.001044,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-08T17:23:21.773001,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c10|Law|Judges|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Other Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology",Asad L.

We put these findings into context by comparing search frequencies with other popular Google searches about sexuality and otherwise.

This paper draws upon anthropology of insult to uncover the distinctness, if at all, of online abuse as a means for political participation as well as for the encumbering it provokes and relations of domination it reproduces as a result. In so doing, the paper critiques the conception of ludic as anti-hegemonic in the Bakhtian tradition, and develops an emic term ‘gaali’ to signal the blurred boundaries between comedy, insult, shame and abuse emerging on online media which also incite gendered forms of intimidation. Gaali, it argues, is best conceptualized through the metaphor of ‘sound’ as distinct from what recent new media studies theorize as ‘voice’.",TRUE,FALSE,Bakhtin|digital politics|gender violence online|India|online abuse|online humor|online insult|social media|trolling,2018-11-07T14:13:01.391760,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-07T14:12:41.052263,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/citation/,4hzt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/waegr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/relationships/node/,waegr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be2c066e057c600170ccba8/,5be2c066e057c600170ccba8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hzt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4hzt6/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444817698776,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4hzt6

At the same time, researchers are becoming aware of the importance of community-collaborative research. However, in Canada, many researchers receive little formal training on how to collaboratively conduct research with Indigenous communities. This is particularly problematic for early-career researchers (ECRs) whose fieldwork often involves interacting with communities. To address this lack of training, two peer-led workshops for Canadian ECRs were organized in 2016 and 2017 with the following objectives: (a) to cultivate awareness about Indigenous cultures, histories and languages; (b) to promote sharing of Indigenous and non-Indigenous ways of knowing; and (c) to foster approaches and explore tools for conducting community collaborative research. Here we present these peer-led Intercultural Indigenous Workshops and discuss workshop outcomes according to five themes: scope and interdisciplinarity, Indigenous representation, workshop environment, skillful moderation and workshop outcomes. We show that peer-led workshops are an effective way for ECRs to cultivate cultural awareness, learn about diverse ways of knowing, and share collaborative research tools and approaches. Developing this skill set is important for ECRs aiming to conduct community-collaborative research, however broader efforts are needed to shift toward more inclusive research paradigms in Canada.",TRUE,FALSE,collaborative research|cultural awareness|early-career researchers|Indigenous communities|peer-led training|workshop evaluation,2018-11-10T13:27:25.291788,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-10T13:26:46.565400,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education,Gwyneth A.
