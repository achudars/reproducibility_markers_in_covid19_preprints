Modern central banking is commonly presented as achieving greater efficacy by directly managing economic expectations, in particular when contrasted with the previous heavy-handed, “hydraulic” transmission of policy objectives through systems of economic aggregates. Such empirical claims are mirrored in the theoretical distinction drawn by sociologists between the openness and efficacy of future-oriented coordination of expectations, and the more rigid coordination achieved through formal organizing and formalization.
This paper uses the case of the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) transition to inflation targeting in the 1980s to show how the precision and flexibility of social coordination through expectations in fact relies on extensive formalization and rigid proceduralization. I show that the tightly coupled control relation on which inflation targeting rests is not possible without the constitutive exclusion of other modes of representing and intervening the economy achieved by this formalization. However, the price for the robust and precise reactivity that modern central banking has constructed between key indicators of inflation expectations and the interest rate set by monetary policy, is a comprehensive procedural dis-embedding of monetary policy from the structure of economic activities whose path into the future it is meant to govern.
The paper concludes that in order to better understand the conditions under which future-oriented modes of coordination fail or succeed, we need to study more closely the formalization of social relations on which they are founded.",TRUE,FALSE,central banks;|conventions|economic coordination|expectations|futurity|indicators|inflation|monetary policy,2018-07-02T11:50:30.409254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-02T10:30:38.970762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/citation/,hrz7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/up5jx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/relationships/node/,up5jx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae759aa8453210014ae9701/,5ae759aa8453210014ae9701,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hrz7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hrz7y,NA

Longitudinal and Cross-sectional Effects of Income Inequality on Trust in U.S. States, 1973–2012","Does income inequality reduce social trust? Although both popular and scholarly accounts have argued that income inequality reduces trust, some recent research has been more skeptical, noting these claims are more robust cross-sectionally than longitudinally. Furthermore, although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for why inequality could affect trust, these have rarely been tested explicitly. I examine the effect of state-level income inequality on trust using the 1973–2012 General Social Surveys. I find little evidence that states that have been more unequal over time have less trusting people. There is some evidence that the growth in income inequality is linked with a decrease in trust, but these effects are sensitive to how time is accounted for. While much previous inequality and trust research has focused on status anxiety, this mechanism receives the little support, but mechanisms based on social fractionalization and on exploitation and resentment receive some support. This analysis improves on previous estimates of the effect of state-level inequality on trust by using far more available observations, accounting for more potential individual and state level confounders, and using higher-quality income inequality data based on annual IRS tax returns. It also contributes to our understanding of the mechanism(s) through which inequality may affect trust.",TRUE,FALSE,income inequality|inequality|misanthropy|social fractionalization|social trust|status anxiety|trust,2018-07-02T11:50:30.362910,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-02T10:30:02.818734,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/citation/,dx8av,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f52ez/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/relationships/node/,f52ez,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae750618453210013ae925b/,5ae750618453210013ae925b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dx8av/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dx8av,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.04.005

I also briefly examine the current neoliberal mineral regime (1986-present). I argue that, to date, capitalist enterprises and neocolonial powers have pursued two contradictory paths to extract precious (gold and silver) and base (chromite, iron, copper, nickel, magnesium, and ore) metals in the Philippines. On the one hand, mining companies appropriated expansive land, underpriced labor and inexpensive food to subsidize capital expenditure and mineral operations. The appropriation of basic inputs - or what is referred to as ""cheap natures"" - allowed these companies to reduce their sunken investments and operational costs. But on the other hand, as the sector developed more, it became increasingly difficult to appropriate such ""cheap natures.""

As an angle of vision, I use the historical geography of late colonial Philippines (1901–1941) to show how paid and unpaid work in food production was not discrete and separated processes but rather conjoined moments of capital accumulation. The colonial regime—in this context, American colonial government, U.S. agribusinesses, and Filipino landed elites—utilized state power, customary land relations, and commodity‐specific characteristics to appropriate vast amounts of unpaid work from agrarian classes of Philippine labour and draft animals towards the exploitation of commodified labour power. These processes not only produced considerable quantities of coconut and sugar products that were exported to the American consumer market, sold at cheaper prices, and contributed to the profitability of U.S. agribusiness elites but also allowed the colonial regime to efficiently expand commodity production across the islands.

Yet many individuals fail to perceive extreme heat as a serious risk. Thus, understanding Americans’ perceptions of heat risk and how such perceptions vary geographically and across different populations is a critical precursor to encouraging adaptive behaviors – such as staying hydrated or refraining from outdoor activity – during heat waves. Using a large original survey dataset of 9,217 respondents, we model Americans’ perceived risk to their health from extreme heat in every populated census tract across the nation. Nationally, risk perceptions are higher in southern states where mortality from heat waves is also highest. However, the extent of variation within states and metropolitan areas is similar to variation between states. Locally, risk perceptions are higher in areas with greater poverty and among minority populations that are more vulnerable to environmental risks in general. We identify  highly vulnerable areas where risk perceptions currently lag heat-related mortality; without concerted adaptation efforts such vulnerability is likely to expand and intensify as heat exposure increases.

Aware of the specialized expertise of the data archives, AJPS called upon the Odum Institute Data Archive to provide a data review service that performs data curation and verification of replication datasets. This article presents a case study of the collaboration between AJPS and the Odum Institute Data Archive to develop a workflow that bridges manuscript publication and data review processes. The case study describes the challenges and the successes of the workflow integration, and offers lessons learned that may be applied by other data archives that are considering expanding their services to include data curation and verification services to support reproducible research.",TRUE,FALSE,data curation|data policy|data verification|replication|reproducibility,2018-07-02T11:50:10.494652,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-27T15:45:27.168139,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/citation/,cfdba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/akp46/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/relationships/node/,akp46,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae336f6bb99c00010498179/,5ae336f6bb99c00010498179,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfdba/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfdba,NA

A Comparative Analysis of Satisfaction with Work–Life Balance,"Part-time work is an increasingly common strategy for handling work and family—but is it an effective strategy everywhere and for everyone? To answer this question, we examine the satisfaction with work–life balance of workers in 22 European countries included in round five of the European Social Survey. Our results show that part-time workers are more satisfied with their work–life balance than full-time workers; the more so, the fewer hours they put in. Yet, we find an important gender difference: Women in marginal part-time work (&lt; 21 hours/week) are more satisfied than men in a similar situation, and conversely men in full-time work are more satisfied than women working full-time. Further, the societal context plays an important role: substantial part-time work (21–34 hours/week) is more conducive to satisfaction with work–life balance in more gender-egalitarian countries than in countries with low gender equality. Hence, a supportive gender climate and institutional support may entice workers to reduce working hours moderately, which results in markedly increased levels of SWLB.",TRUE,FALSE,Europe|gender inequalities|Part-time work|work–family reconciliation|Working hours|work–life balance,2018-07-02T11:50:10.329971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-27T10:49:23.871844,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",The authors,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/citation/,scpx6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j5vp8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/relationships/node/,j5vp8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae2da68bb99c00010491eeb/,5ae2da68bb99c00010491eeb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/scpx6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/scpx6,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616696.2018.1473627

Local and National Factionalism in the National Organization for Women,"While the National Organization for Women (NOW) has endured over time, it has faced significant internal factionalism. In this article, I ask why some of these factions resulted in schisms, while other factions persisted in NOW over time. This is a critical question for understanding how organizational location and factional collective identities combine to produce different outcomes when internal conflict breaks out. My analysis of interview, archival, and secondary data indicates that organizational location influences factions’ independent collective identities, shaping what they want and their perceptions of opportunities to change their organization. Compared to national level factions, local factions also lack the ability to use NOW’s hierarchical structure to their advantage in their effort to stay. This sheds lights on the distinct patterns of factionalism and schism in formalized groups.",TRUE,FALSE,factionalism|feminism|organizations|schism|social movements,2018-07-02T11:50:09.728640,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-27T10:46:35.065583,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/citation/,dysgb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4zxhq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/relationships/node/,4zxhq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae258c0bb99c0000e482ff2/,5ae258c0bb99c0000e482ff2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dysgb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dysgb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dysgb,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11133-017-9365-8
