By applying a feminist standpoint framework, we argue that an ethic of “objectivity” and a privileging of the unattached researcher creates an experiential gap in the disaster literature whereby researchers who themselves experience disaster are undervalued and underrepresented. We analyze reflexive accounts by disaster researchers to show what epistemological barriers emerge from conventional processes of inquiry and the systematic disadvantaging of local, affected researchers. We also study patterns in articles by “outsider” and “insider” researchers, focusing on differences and similarities in research questions, reflexivity, relationships with and access to participants, and larger theoretical goals. This comparison reveals that the unique position of affected researchers can help to bridge formal knowledge and practical life knowledge, creating new and worthwhile paths to understanding the social effects of disaster.",TRUE,FALSE,disaster|emotions|epistemology|experience|gender|Hurricane Katrina|theory,2018-09-06T21:15:01.781731,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T21:14:46.037807,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/citation/,b342a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g97mk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/relationships/node/,g97mk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b915ef2e39d950018cc2410/,5b915ef2e39d950018cc2410,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b342a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b342a/,https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2015.1086287,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b342a

This limited scope obscures important ways in which these factors could have been related to voting behavior among other racial sub-groups of the electorate, as well as participation in the two-party contest in the first place. Using the vote-validated 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey, merged with economic data at the ZIP code and county levels, we find that racial attitudes strongly explain two-party vote choice among white voters – in line with a growing body of literature.

It is a common assumption in this research area that people tend to be selective about the political information they expose themselves to and also to selectively process it. Selective exposure and selective perception processes are mainly based on the dominant political orientation of the recipient, which usually leads to a reinforcement of preexisting political perceptions and attitudes. We review recent research on selective exposure and perceptions and argue for greater involvement of findings in social psychology regarding differences in cognitive styles that underlie individual policy orientations and justify why and how these findings can promote the study of partisan selectivity in the reception of political communication. We conclude by highlighting theoretical and methodological perspectives arising from the proposed extension of research on selectivity in the process of receiving political communication.

The literature suggests that such disasters have the potential to spur greater environmentalism and environmental action, as residents make connections between global environmental change and local events.  However, the literature also suggests that residents in communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction might see technological disasters, like oil spills, as threats to their economic well-being, thereby limiting environmental reflexivity.  Given that Alberta is home of the tar sands, how might a flood disaster affect men’s environmental views, given both traditional notions of masculinity and men’s economic dependence on oil production?  Using a survey of 407 flood-affected residents of Calgary and in-depth qualitative interviews with 20 men directly impacted by the flood, this article demonstrates men’s decreased tendency to change their environmental views after the flood.  The qualitative data reveal that men justify this reluctance by shifting blame for climate change to the Global South, by arguing for the economic centrality of the tar sands for Alberta, and by discussing how a warming climate will largely be a positive outcome for Alberta.  The article concludes with discussion of relevance for environmental sociology and for public policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|complacency|disaster|environmental views|fossil fuels|gender|masculinity,2018-09-06T21:14:20.987542,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T21:14:09.253110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/citation/,hy9wt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bq4wj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/relationships/node/,bq4wj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9149eb57f3d1001a5fad99/,5b9149eb57f3d1001a5fad99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hy9wt/,https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2017.1295837,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hy9wt

To contrast the relative significance of economic homogeneity versus the efficacy of welfare state and labor market institutions in shaping income distributions, we compare the structure of inequality in the EU-28 to that of the 50 United States. This comparison stands in contrast to the standard practice of evaluating the US against individual EU Member States. Despite the greater relative heterogeneity of the 28 EU Member States and our corrections for the underreporting of household income in the US, post-fisc income inequality in the EU-28 remains lower than that of the US from 2006 onward. Moreover, inequality appears to be rising in the US while it has remained stagnant since 2008 in the EU-28. In both unions, and particularly the US, within-state income differences contribute more to union-wide inequality than between-state differences. In a counterfactual analysis, we find that if the EU-28 matched the between-state homogeneity of the US, but maintained its relative within-country inequalities, pan-European inequality would fall by only 20 percent. Conversely, inequality in the US would fall by 34 percent if it matched the within-country inequality of the EU-28. Our findings suggest that the strengthening of egalitarian institutions within the 28 Member States is more consequential than economic convergence in reducing pan-European income inequality.

Though the justification may go beyond the desire to overcome incentive problems (such as moral hazard or adverse selection), it is desirable for payments to be closely tied to impacts – “as if” to incentivize implementers to perform in the interests of program beneficiaries. We describe a so-called impact bond transaction in the poverty alleviation space that commits payments in direct proportion to the economic value created in beneficiary households.

Using data from the Project on Devolution and Urban Change, a unique geographically-linked, longitudinal, multi-city set of survey data, logistic regression models weigh the relative importance of individual barriers to employment (poor health, childcare and family responsibilities, etc.) and contextual or neighborhood barriers to employment (poverty rate, joblessness rate, etc.) on labor market outcomes.  Results reveal that several neighborhood characteristics are predictive of employment, including automobile access, female-headedness, vacancy, and disorder.  Results suggest a more complex, nuanced interplay between neighborhood-level variables and individually-measured variables in preventing some women from obtaining both modestly paying employment with few allocated hours of work per week, and also better-paying jobs with more hours of work per week.",TRUE,FALSE,Employment|Gender|Neighborhood effects|Welfare reform,2018-09-06T14:53:02.644598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T14:49:35.860865,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/citation/,57e4a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6k7ph/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/relationships/node/,6k7ph,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b90459dc14d70001911080a/,5b90459dc14d70001911080a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/57e4a/,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9906.2012.00636.x,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/57e4a

Yet catastrophic events, like disasters, have the potential to rupture or disrupt complacency toward environmental problems, forcing individuals to consider the potential effects of human activity on the environment as they expose how environmentally harmful practices put people at risk.  This article is based on focus group interviews with 46 residents of High River, Alberta, a rural community hardest hit by the 2013 Southern Alberta flood.  It examines if and how experiencing the flood prompted residents to think about the environment or interact with it in new ways.  Findings suggest that residents voice a contradiction- while they believe that pre-flood human activity like deforestation, river diversion, and home-building altered the environment and placed communities like their own at risk, they also argue that natural forces like disasters are immune to human efforts to control them.  Residents feel their environment is less stable and predicable since the flood, and they worry more about toxicity and associated environmental health risks.  The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for environmental sociology and public policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|change|disaster|environmental views|flood|uncertainty,2018-09-06T14:53:42.527893,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T14:51:17.102665,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/citation/,s4ufr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t2myr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/relationships/node/,t2myr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b903e5e7f716c00195d9ea6/,5b903e5e7f716c00195d9ea6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s4ufr/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496516669351,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s4ufr

The relationship between energy consumption and age is complex and understudied. We evaluated the existence and determinants of an age-energy consumption profile in the U.S. residential sector, using microdata from four waves of the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) in 1987, 1990, 2005, and 2009. We constructed pseudo cohorts from Bayesian generalized linear model estimates to draw micro-profiles for energy consumption across the life course. Overall, we found that residential energy consumption increases over the life course. Much of the increase in energy consumption is due to housing size. Variations in the age-energy consumption micro-profiles can be described by concave and convex functions. In contrast to previous research that suggested that population aging would reduce energy demand, our results indicate that changing population age structure could amplify residential energy demand.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|energy consumption,2018-09-05T07:01:44.731150,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-05T07:01:21.188311,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Hossein Estiri,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/citation/,yqkva,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ebcqv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/relationships/node/,ebcqv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8f55515a499e0017e1cb38/,5b8f55515a499e0017e1cb38,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqkva/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yqkva/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yqkva

We do so by applying the Weibull family of negative exponential distributions. For the analysis, we have used the ""IBM Watson telco customer demo dataset"", a public dataset of churning customers.  We show that the Weibull distribution is a better fit for modeling Prepaid scenarios that display a high churn onset at the beginning but flattens out as time t progresses. We then contrast our model with traditional methods of churn estimation and compare results between the different approaches.",TRUE,FALSE,churn|mobile carrier|prepaid|survival analysis|telecommunications|weibull,2018-09-05T00:07:05.188691,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-05T00:06:36.356627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/citation/,baq76,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bcagm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/relationships/node/,bcagm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8ee958fbf7a60018538756/,5b8ee958fbf7a60018538756,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/baq76/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/baq76/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/baq76
