In conjunction with amicus briefs filed by the Department of Justice seemingly supporting LGBT+ discrimination by employers or businesses, LGBTQ+ students may feel even more vulnerable in the college environment. But, to assume that homophobia or transphobia is felt only by those who identify under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, is to misunderstand the fluidity and complexity of gender and sexuality. Because gender is a material aspect of their college experience for all students. 
College admissions forms typically only ask for the students' sex assigned at birth, and sexuality is typically not asked on admissions' forms. Facilities on campus including bathrooms, changing facilities, campus housing, and athletics are commonly segregated by sex (Beemyn, 2005). Rules that police what genders are allowed in certain spaces do not just impact trans* and non-binary people; however, the extent to which anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment has had negative repercussions for heterosexual and cisgender students, is unknown and understudied.
Our goal for this study is twofold. First, we want to explore levels of gender marginalization on college campuses and then, we want to better understand who is at risk of feeling marginalized. In addition to conventional measures of sex, gender and sexual identities we explore novel, scaled measures of how students see themselves, and how they think others see them, with respect to masculinity, femininity, and androgyny.",TRUE,FALSE,androgyny|college|femininity|gender|gender image|LGBT|marginalization|masculinity|students,2018-07-02T11:39:50.436107,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-22T22:38:01.666729,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/citation/,kg6f2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vxbty/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/relationships/node/,vxbty,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8e423d91b689000f9e3796/,5a8e423d91b689000f9e3796,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kg6f2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kg6f2,NA

Because skill-intensive goods are also high-income elastic in the data, I find an intuitive, previously unexplored, and strong interaction between the two channels.

The study finds shift in spatial and temporal deixis that manifests a strong tendency towards increasing the ‘level of enunciation’ of narrators’ spatial and temporal location within the narrative. This shift brings the main narrator closer to the other characters in temporal, spatial, and mental space, hence increasing her involvement in events and empathy towards characters. At the same time, it distances the outside frame narrator, who has limited contact with characters, and increases his detachment and antipathy. In both cases more is revealed of narrator-character relationships and the narrator’s evaluations, leading to a more subjective narrative mood.

It is an analytical literary study from a linguistic standpoint using Kenny’s (2011) ideas. In addition to focusing on differences, the aim of this study is to scrutinize silence and its different meanings inasmuch as silence is a distinctive feature that groups and differentiates both plays. The study sheds light on a different aspect of research. Hence, besides focusing on interpreting speeches, this paper analyzes silences in both plays. It vindicates that silences are as important in literary interpretation as speeches. While Beckett’s silences indicate the void of modern life, Pinter’s silences convey threats and violence. Albeit much attention is given to verbal utterances and  silences are generally neglected in terms of literary analysis, they are a sine qua non in terms of understanding Beckett’s Waiting for Godot and Pinter’s The Dumb Waiter and most importantly understanding the different languages of silence that greatly contribute to the whole meaning of both plays.

The poem is a dramatic monologue, exploring Persephone’s part of the story and her journey to the Underworld with Hades. The poem is approached from a feminist point of view. The paper sets two sections, the first reviews the theoretical parts concerning mythology and feminism, the second presents the application of the feminist theories on Kizer’s poem. The study aims to provide answers to crucial questions of the differences between the myth and the poet’s interpretation, portrayals of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, and the myth’s reinvented themes, as well as the depictions of her heroine. The study has arrived at some outcomes; first, Kizer’s poem is describing womanhood in Persephone’s individuation. Second, Kizer’s version is exploring woman’s psychological rather than social states.

My principal research question is: to what extent could the study of the various types of schemata benefit translation students, professionals and trainers? Drawing on Grice’s cooperative principle (1975), Martin and White’s appraisal theory (2005), and Pym’s risk management analysis (2015), three English excerpts with their corresponding Arabic translations are thoroughly analyzed. This is followed by linking the findings to translator training. The comparative analysis demonstrates that activating schema seems to reflect the translator’s ideology and power relations as a result of asymmetric information that characterizes the relation between translators, commissioners and readers. It also shows that the lack of formal schema leads to an inaccurate employment of the linguistic schema and image schema. Finally, the paper argues that the same schema building techniques, such as semantic mapping, adopted in EFL teaching methods could be applied to translator training. The study, therefore, concludes with a call for empirical translation research into the functions of schemata, particularly the linguistic schema, in light of think-aloud protocols.",TRUE,FALSE,English-Arabic translation|Grice’s maxims|risk management|schema|translator training,2018-07-02T11:39:47.971757,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:39:04.949904,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/citation/,3k6ux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e6xj4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/relationships/node/,e6xj4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba99960511e000edc874a/,5a8ba99960511e000edc874a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3k6ux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3k6ux/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3k6ux,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.11

However, as a result of technology, globalization and political changes, women suffer not only because of their gender but also because of their class, race or religion, which Crenchaw (1989) summarizes in the term “intersectionality” (p. 538). Shedding light on women’s multiple identities can help contemporary societies spot the discrimination that contemporary women suffer from; consequently, these societies can find solutions to eliminate the sources of women’s double marginalization. Race, class, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation are intersecting loci of discriminations or privileges (McCall, 2005, p. 1771). Although this is a western paradigm, it can be applied to Saudi Arabian literature. The elements of gynocriticism and intersectionality are evident in the works of Raja Alem, a feminist writer from Mecca, Saudi Arabia and the first woman to win the International Prize for Arabic Fiction. Due to the dearth of structured feminist literary criticism in the Arab world, this paper traces the history of feminist literary criticism and applies a gynocritic-intersectional model to Raja Alem’s novel, The Dove’s Necklace (2012) in order to examine the projection of women and help close the research gap in Arabic feminist criticism. The researcher probes the biological, linguistic, psychoanalytical and cultural depiction of the female characters in the novel along with their intersectional identities. The findings show that women’s overlapping identities influence the way they experience oppression and discrimination.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|feminist theories|gynocriticism|ideologies|methodicide,2018-07-02T11:39:47.938791,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:37:26.655908,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/citation/,ucm4a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gu2zf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/relationships/node/,gu2zf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ba8d6571031000e44dea6/,5a8ba8d6571031000e44dea6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ucm4a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ucm4a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ucm4a,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.10
