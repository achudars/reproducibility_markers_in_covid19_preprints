What follows is the observation that these properties have their own system of relations, placed in the context of a culture of objects which engages a revealing process. An argument is presented for considering organization as the principle which allows for seepage, understood as an inherently informative and intuitive process where the organization of objects reveals some property and consequently makes us less uncertain about the object. Objects are deposited to be a continual process where the properties represented by the organization of its constituent parts change as they seep beyond its matrix.

This study explores how online news media in the Philippines and Malaysia depicted the outbreak of COVID-19 during the early period of its spread. The study analyzes the discourse around the outbreak based on a large corpus of Facebook news posts between January and March 2020. Using a corpus-based approach called Keyness Analysis, salient themes &amp; topics, and framings around the disease were identified and interpreted. The results show the differences in the reporting of the outbreak between the two countries. News reports in the Philippines depicted the disease in an enigmatic lens which explains the alarmist angle of news reports and the reassuring tone of the government, versus the war framing of Malaysian news that depicted the disease as an enemy to be fought and defeated. In reporting about the bid to contain the spread of the virus, Philippine news reports dealt mostly with the restrictions and regulations of movement while the Malaysian news covered more issues on personal hygiene and safety protocols. Lastly, concerns for Filipino seafarers and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) that needs to be repatriated was a recurring theme in Philippine news reports regarding COVID-19, while concerns for the economy was prominent in the Malaysian news reports.

Optimal health not only forms a central component of our happiness, but it is also vital for a strong economy. Despite this, reports suggest that population health is declining, with the average adult expected to spend 20% of their life in ill-health. Given the ever-increasing burden of non- communicable disease, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity-related conditions, alongside our growing and ageing population, the need for adequate strategies to prevent ill- health has never been greater. However, as our healthcare model is relatively centralised, the development, coordination and delivery of comprehensive prevention strategies is incredibly difficult. This is not only because a central system cannot make strategies that are flexible enough to cater for every demographic, but also because the average person spends very little time engaged directly with formal healthcare services. To circumvent these issues, focus has turned to the communities in which people live, work and play as an asset to prevent ill-health and promote wellbeing.

Using public information, we construct and analyze a database of nearly 350,000 incarceration episodes in the city jail system from 2014 - 2020. In concordance with de Blasio's stated policy, inmates discharged immediately after his order were at a lower risk of reoffense than inmates discharged during the same calendar week in previous years. The inmates in the former group were also slightly older, on average, than those in the latter group, although the overall age distributions of the two groups were quite similar. Additionally, the inmates of the former group had spent dramatically longer in jail than those in the latter group. With the release of long-serving inmates demonstrated to be feasible, we also examine how the jail population would have looked over the past six years had caps in incarceration been in place. With a cap of one year, the system would experience a 15% decrease in incarceration. With a cap of 100 days, incarceration would be just under 50% of the realized value. Because our results are only as accurate as New York City's public-facing jail data, we discuss numerous challenges with this data and suggest improvements. These improvements would address issues including inmate age, gender, and race. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our work, highlight some opportunities and challenges posed by incarceration caps, and suggest key areas for reform. It is striking that the de Blasio administration was able to identify inmates at low risk of reoffense and was willing to release them.

Contrary to products that exhibit positive network externalities upon adoption, this structure of incentives likely results in negative peer influence: the more friends that adopted the product, the smaller the incentives to adopt. We measure this effect empirically by using observational data from a large mobile carrier serving 5.7 million users. We estimate the effect of peer influence across five different products of this type. A naive approach to do so results in a positive estimate for peer influence due to unobserved homophily. We follow two approaches to address this issue. First, we suggest using the number of friends that end up adopting the product as a proxy for unobserved user fixed effects. Second, we control for homophily by applying a shuffle test, i.e., we compare the effect of peer influence from the original data with the effect obtained from comparable randomly generated data without peer influence. We get negative estimates from both approaches, which provides robustness to our findings. Finally, we show that even for these products, the effect of peer influence associated with the first friends that adopt the product is positive, which arises because they still convey useful information about reducing uncertainty. The negative effect of peer influence arises only for the subsequent friends that adopt the product. These friends are unlikely to convey new information about the product, but each of them decreases the economic incentive to adopt, resulting in a negative aggregate effect of peer influence.",TRUE,FALSE,free riding|homophily|network externalities|peer influence|randomization,2021-02-14T01:16:01.130959,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T01:15:41.768124,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Rodrigo Belo and Pedro Ferreira,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/citation/,wz4k9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60282d0bd6a4320250f13ba1/,60282d0bd6a4320250f13ba1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz4k9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wz4k9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wz4k9

My goal is to examine whether 'de' can assign genitive case subject to a contrastive analysis by virtue of X-bar theories proposed by Chomsky (1981, 1986). In addition to this, I also adopt the expression of logical form (LF) and phonetic form (PF) suggested by Chomsky (2015) so as to seek a justification for answering why 'de' can be omitted (covert) in some specific cases. Providing that a conclusion is reached, the present research will strengthen the idea that 'de' may be an assigner of genitive case.",TRUE,FALSE,Genitive case|LF|Mandarin Chinese|PF|possessive marker,2021-02-14T01:09:42.172931,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T01:09:21.356757,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0a|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0b|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies|Chinese Studies,DIANCHENG LI,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/citation/,5d9ut,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60281b6473c9fe028f075e8f/,60281b6473c9fe028f075e8f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5d9ut/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5d9ut/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5d9ut

Extrapolating existing research reveals how cross-nativity relationships may serve as conduits of resources, knowledge, and connections that facilitate political participation; as spaces of political resocialization, bringing together partners with different experiences and understandings of citizenship; and, alternatively, as a selection mechanism whereby immigrant integration results in cross-nativity relationships among those more likely to participate in politics. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and linking information about married and cohabiting couples, this study assesses whether cross-nativity partnering is associated with voting. Logistic regression models predicting voting using respondents’ and their partners’ immigrant generation indicate two broad findings. First, having a second or third+ generation partner is positively associated with voting, consistent with theoretical expectations that US-born partners provide resources or signal selection. Second, and more surprisingly, there is small but significant variation in voting among the third+ generation based on their partner’s immigrant generation. This indicates inadequacies in theorizing US-born partners solely as providers, and is more consistent with political resocialization. Importantly, this finding challenges theoretical and empirical assumptions in immigration research about the third+ generation as a static baseline. Overall, this study contributes to expanding scholarly focus beyond the individual to the role of relationships, in particular of spouses and cohabiting partners, in integrating immigrants into political life, and, more broadly, in shaping and contextualizing interactions between the state and its citizens and subjects.",TRUE,FALSE,couples|immigration|intermarriage|political participation|voting,2021-02-14T01:07:21.361345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T01:07:06.897301,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://cps.ipums.org/cps/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/citation/,z8nsr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6028007373c9fe0288075f41/,6028007373c9fe0288075f41,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8nsr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z8nsr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z8nsr

Fortification entails prioritizing and instituting multiple types of infrastructure, technology, and routines that militarize schools while defining 'safety' as a function of the building and framing educators as responders to gun violence. The school security industry is now a $2.7 billion market, so it is vital to comprehend the structures, policies, conceptualizations, resources, and activities linked with school safety. We apply structure-agency theory to advance arguments on the fortification of schools. In particular, we explain the interrelation between racialized school safety policies and practices. Thus, we highlight educators’ discretion in enacting safety policy in varied contexts. Our discussion of fortification sheds light on the nexus of guns and schools, operationalizes facets of structure-agency theory, and provides recommendations for research and practice.",TRUE,FALSE,organizational theory|policy implementation|school discipline|school safety|school shootings|structure-agency theory,2021-02-14T01:02:42.754411,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T01:02:25.089082,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Woulfin and Sadler,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/citation/,8ub6a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6027fadf232383027a9dc0dc/,6027fadf232383027a9dc0dc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ub6a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8ub6a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8ub6a
