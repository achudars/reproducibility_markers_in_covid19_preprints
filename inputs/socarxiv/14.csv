However, as reported by Armitage et al. (2020), a high degree of inconsistency is found when comparing the bibliometric corpora obtained with different approaches. These inconsistencies are not due to minor technical issues, but instead they represent different interpretations of SDGs. Given the variety of understandings regarding the relationship between research and SDGs, we propose that bibliometrics analysts should not assume that there is one single, preferred or consensus way of mapping SDGs to publications. We propose instead that, since different stakeholders have contrasting views about the relationships between science and SDGs, the contribution of bibliometrics should be to provide a plural landscape for stakeholders to explore their own views.

Data examined were collected between 1997 and 2015, and we examine respondents ranging in age from 17-35 during those years, allowing for the consideration of effects across the life course. We find women who had children at early ages were more likely to take out loans to attend college, but at older ages loans were associated with lower parenthood rates among women. Women with loans had marginally lower marriage rates at older ages, were significantly younger on average when they did have children, and were significantly less likely to be married at first birth, even after accounting for differences in age at first birth and selection effects.

Moreover, it examines whether apprentices’ enjoyment of training ex-plains this association. Using longitudinal data on 5,600 apprentices from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS, Starting Cohort 4), the results of discrete event history models show that all types of compromises are crucial for VET dropout, but especially compromises regarding field of work and downward discrepancies in gen-der type.

However, it is unclear whether this is due to college attendance itself or because those who go to college differ from those who do not in ways (directly or indirectly) related to their later political identification. In this paper, we therefore attempt to estimate the effect of college on political identification net of people’s tendencies to select into college using an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. Based on data from the General Social Survey, we analyze how this effect has changed over time and whether college affects the political identification of women in the same ways as that of men.

Here, I investigate whether ambient temperatures in utero and during the early years of life are associated with reductions in life expectancy. I combine monthly, state-level climatological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with high-resolution, individual-level mortality data from the CenSoc Project, which consists of cleaned and harmonized Social Security Administration death records from 1988-2005. Results indicate that exposure to higher ambient temperatures during gestation and the first four years of life are associated with increased mortality risk in later life for white men from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, but not other groups. It is likely that the effect of climate variability on later life mortality for non-white men is overshadowed by structural systems of racism that impact health stratification. Overall, the results emphasize how climate change has already begun to imprint itself onto demographic processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Administrative Record|CenSoc|Climate Change|Life Expectancy|Mortality,2021-05-07T15:48:06.344570,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-07T12:03:39.620843,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://censoc.berkeley.edu/,no,This study was not preregistered,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,Nathan Seltzer,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/citation/,7ndu4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60952ae919183d04ca5508b1/,60952ae919183d04ca5508b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ndu4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7ndu4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7ndu4,NA

However, negative party identification is an important understudied side of party identification that affects democratic dissatisfaction and political conflict. This article studies how individual differences such as the Big Five personality traits, narcissistic admiration and rivalry, as well as need for closure affect negative party identification and partisanship types, such as being a negative, open, or closed partisan. I argue that different types of partisan attachments fulfill different psychological needs and the kind of attachments individuals show can thus be traced back to their personality features. Based on a novel online quota survey from Germany conducted in February 2021 (N= 2,095), I find agreeableness as well as narcissistic rivalry to be central traits for different types of partisanship. Furthermore, negative partisans against a radical-right party show a different profile from partisans with other system parties.",TRUE,FALSE,big five|NARQ|negative party identification|partisanship|personality traits,2021-05-07T15:32:24.315452,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-07T10:33:01.957794,FALSE,NA,no,Will be available after data cleaning,,available,NA,https://osf.io/4ge5q/?view_only=da0eb50685524cadbfb9d6cf4bc05f52,prereg_analysis,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/citation/,aejt7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609514bd19183d04c4555c5d/,609514bd19183d04c4555c5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aejt7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aejt7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aejt7,NA

Indirect carbon emissions are often neglected because they are difficult to calculate. The traditional approach to calculating indirect emissions – Life Cycle Assessment – is expensive and requires an expert data analyst. We introduce an alternative approach, the Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis. We show how this approach – currently used at macro-level to estimate carbon emissions at national or regional level – can be applied to the business level using carbon emissions generated by one hotel room clean as an example. Our comparative analysis shows that Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis leads to similar results as Life Cycle Assessment, while being substantially cheaper and more user-friendly. Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis, we conclude, enables tourism businesses to estimate the indirect carbon emissions of their operations, which is the key to identifying target areas for improvement.",TRUE,FALSE,Environmentally extended input-output analysis|life cycle assessment|Scope 3 emissions|tourism carbon inventories|tourism environmental impact,2021-05-08T23:57:01.527898,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-08T23:56:19.856379,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/citation/,49h5q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6094d55a6801ab04aa2a6984/,6094d55a6801ab04aa2a6984,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/49h5q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/49h5q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/49h5q,https://doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2021.1924181
