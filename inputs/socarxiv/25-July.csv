The Ways the Canadian-Born and Foreign-Born Changed Weekly Activities During the Pandemic,"During epidemics, individuals change their weekly activities to increase their sense of personal security, health, efficacy and comfort. This study looks at changes in weekly activities reported by Canadians and foreign-born citizens during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. The data for the study is drawn from a combined survey of two cycles of the CPSS (Canadian Perspective Series) surveys 2 and 4 which were conducted between May 4 and July 26, 2020. The combined survey consisted of 8,818 adult respondents (7,280 Canadian-born and 1,538 Foreign-born respondents). Weekly activities were measured by 25 survey questions which collected information on habits such as washing hands, avoiding crowds, watching more T.V., internet use and exercising. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as the main tool for the statistical analysis of the data. Statistical testing of mean differences revealed that Canadian and foreign-born groups differed from each other in 15 out of the 25 activity items tested. PCA identified six major domains of weekly activities. Immigrants displayed similar activity patterns compared to the Canadian-born concerning the Sanitary, Leisure, Planning and Hoarding domain of activities but were found somewhat dissimilar in terms of the Sheltering and Substance use activity domains. During the pandemic lockdown, immigrants ""hunkered down"" and were more proactive in adopting sheltering types of activities such as cancelling travel plans, exercising more indoors than outdoors, practicing meditation and making better food choices. In doing so, they also avoided substance use as pandemic coping activities such as higher consumption of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis compared to the Canadian-born.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|Canadian-born|Foreign-born|Pandemic|Routine Activities,2021-06-11T09:04:01.132957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-11T08:19:00.305165,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,None,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/citation/,a2btf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c22f2318f70b020ba7f4ff/,60c22f2318f70b020ba7f4ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2btf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a2btf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a2btf

Education can be said to improve civilization, grow the nation and form a generation of nations that can carry out various interests for their individuals. The more advanced the era, the nation asks to have quality human resources. It can be obtained with an education system that has a high quality. However, problems arise with the emergence of issues of poor character education such as juvenile delinquency, corruption, racial conflicts, etc. This book explains how important it is to develop character education in schools. The author explains that character development must be balanced with the times. In addition, it is also explained that the quality in the field of science can fall if it is not balanced with character education as a whole. An Introduction to Character Education Books was written for various purposes. The most basic purpose of writing this book is to participate in completing references and expanding educational thinking. Through this book, the author also contributes to the development of educational thinking, especially character education. Moreover, about what is meant by character education and why character education is essential, this book can present various thoughts on character education in education these days. This book is intended primarily for educational actors such as teachers, students, and education observers. It is hoped that this book can serve as a reference for studies related to character education in educational institutions.

His only job was to collect, retype Marx's papers and give them to publishers. Some books describe him as an amateur writer, limited in his abilities and unable to adapt to Marx's thinking. That is why the editor of this book, Dede Mulyanto, compiled the anthology ""Behind Marx: The Characters and Thoughts of Friedrich Engels"" published by Marjin Kiri a few months ago.
In general, the book introduces Engels' life and thought, and explores his relationship to Marx in a way that does not simply place him within or under Marx. In this book, we will realize that Engels was not only a loyal friend but also provided the impetus and avenue for Marx to write and publish his work. Not only was he the saddest person at the time of Marx's death, but he also didn't even have time to finish the Das Kapital masterpiece. In addition, we also see Engels' persistence in compiling Marx's research notes and compiling them to produce a series of publications, including Das Kapital and Das Kapital.
We also gain a deeper understanding of Engels, as explained in the brief description by Sylvia Tiwon in the introduction to the book, as a theorist who developed the theory of historical materialism into scientific fields outside of economics and struggled with the latest scientific discoveries of his time.
This book exists to restore Engels' figures and thoughts and to place them accordingly. It is a challenge to reintroduce the image and ideas of Engels to Indonesian readers today, not only in formal legal aspects, such as prohibiting the spread of Marxist ideas through TAP MPR/Ketetapan Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat  (Resolution People's Consultative Assembly) No. 25 of 1966 but also in the theoretical aspects of Marxism itself. As we know MPR/Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat (People's Consultative Assembly) decree 25 of 1966 is a product of the highest law of the times and has acted as an integrating mechanism and effective conflict resolution to address the nation's breakdown after the G30S / PKI 1965, which devastated national unity. With the MPRS decree, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was dissolved and declared a prohibited organization throughout the territory of the Republic of Indonesia and a ban was imposed on any activities to spread or develop the understanding or teachings of Communism/Marxism-Leninism. 
When studying the thinking of this German man, the main question that often arises is: Why does Engels need to be studied? Why didn't Engels study Marx's thinking right away? The ideological leanings of neo-Marxist scientists further exacerbated this situation. They hoped that by identifying Engels as the culprit of the extreme and rigid interpretation, Marx's theory was freed from the bad thoughts of Soviet determination.",TRUE,FALSE,Criticism of Friedrich|Friedrich Engels|Marx|Marxism,2021-06-11T09:13:43.038802,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-11T08:31:55.419091,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/citation/,3c4fm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c22105da0ff201fe394451/,60c22105da0ff201fe394451,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3c4fm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3c4fm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3c4fm

The generation that uses social media to build wider networks and insights. This book is about an age that likes to get together, talk about many ideas, and try to make them happen. Besides that, it also describes the millennial generation who use optimism as a starting point for movement and change. The condition of the millennial generation trying to stay back at the roots of the noble culture of the Indonesian nation is a big picture of the book ""Generation Back to the Roots.""
The book ""Generation Back to the Roots"" was written and intended to meet readers' needs, namely the nation's younger generations. The generation that begins to recognize the nation's civilization. The era that started to move to explore the noble culture of the country. This book explains the conditions of the millennial generation who are struggling to return to the roots of the nation and state's lives. The millennial generation and the general public are starting to forget the origins of the Indonesian government.
This book presents the author's research for more than ten years regarding the millennial generation, who are starting to re-discuss ideals and build national narratives. In addition, it also provides information about the succession of ages in each period. It also tells how the development of mindset from generation to generation maintains the roots of the Indonesian nation. And most importantly, the book ""Generation Back to the Roots"" focuses on how the result of the mentality of the current millennial generation is starting to think about the nation's ideology as the root of the state.

Moreover, it is explained how can use the mindset from generation to generation to think and learn for the next millennial generation. The book ""Generation Back to the Roots"" is essential to review because it contains a moral message to the current millennial generation to continue learning and bringing development to a more advanced Indonesia.

But, unlike a tornado or nuclear meltdown, COVID-19 laid waste to social infrastructure in unique ways that only a disease can do. On the one hand, a pandemic brings biological dangers that, in turn, make all individuals—loved ones, too—into potential threats of biological contamination. On the other hand, the efforts to contain diseases present social dangers, as isolation and distancing threatens mundane and spectacular ritualized encounters and mask-wearing heighten our awareness of the biological risk. By exploring the link between disasters and disease, this paper leverages the contamination process, beginning first with the barriers it presents to making and remaking the self in everyday life. Constraints on ritualized encounters, both in terms of delimiting face-to-face interaction and in determining some spaces are contaminative risks, reduces collective life to imagined communities or shifts to digitally mediated spaces. The former intensifies the sense of anomie people feel as their social world appears as though it were disintegrating while the latter presents severe neurobiological challenges to reproducing what face-to-face interaction habitually generates. Finally, these micro/meso-level processes are contextualized by considering how institutions, particularly polity but also science, collective risk and how their efficacy may either contribute to the erosion of solidarity or provide a sense of support in the face of anomic terror. Using the U.S. to illustrate these processes, we are able to show how an inefficacious State response weakens the already tenuous connective tissue that holds a diffuse and diverse population together, while also exposing and intensifying existing political, economic, and cultural fissures, thereby further eroding existing solidarity and the capacity to rebuild post-pandemic cohesion.",TRUE,FALSE,anomie|contamination|COVID-19|danger|disintegration|Durkheim|pollution|risk|solidarity,2021-06-11T09:06:43.153156,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-11T08:27:51.598877,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/citation/,tb538,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c21531da0ff201fe390fa0/,60c21531da0ff201fe390fa0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb538/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tb538/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tb538
