Ecological research implies that the total population of writers can consist of target specialists, generalists, or both. Target preferences are either similar or dissimilar among individuals.
Methods: One year of graffiti removal data relating to 1,904 incidents committed by 263 individuals were extracted for a medium-sized city in Belgium. Individual target specialization and preferences were analyzed using ecological network methods.
Results: The total diversity in target choices at the aggregate level is primarily the result of substantial between-individual variation. The results indicate that the total population of graffiti writers largely consists of target specialists, and can be divided into subgroups that share similar target preferences. Aggregate patterns of target selection do not accurately reflect individual variation in target choice specialization, at least for graffiti writing.
Conclusions: We recommend future research to account for individual differences in target specialization.

Moreover, with the development and persistence of the economic and financial crisis within the EU, immigration has been linked to growing opposition and criticism towards the European Union. In a country in which Euroscepticism has historically been high compared to countries in continental Europe, EU immigration-related statements connected to EU free-border agreements became more widespread. For this reason, we expect immigration to be a prominent issue in the electoral campaign of the upcoming 2014 European Parliament elections in the media. By covering EU immigrants and EU immigration issues in a certain way, media tend to promote or restrain certain ideas of immigration, that might eventually affect public’s views. In fact, we know from previous studies that immigration, particularly in times of economic crisis, is a challenge for society that can be framed not only in positive or negative terms, but also in economic or cultural terms.
This study first considers the salience of coverage of EU immigrants and EU immigration issues in UK newspapers
in the three months preceding the EU elections of May 2014. It further explores whether news coverage of different newspapers is framed in terms of economic or cul-
tural terms. In addition, we mine information from social media to discover how the immigration debate is framed by politically engaged members of the public on these platforms.",TRUE,FALSE,immigration|media|migration|text mining|topic modeling,2020-02-13T18:20:02.299971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-13T18:19:45.289805,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/citation/,e39g5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h5scb/,h5scb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e457e3e3e86a800a26e4ca5/,5e457e3e3e86a800a26e4ca5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e39g5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e39g5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e39g5

We show that the fund imposed fewer conditions on loans to countries geographically closer to the communist bloc. Results are stronger when neighboring communist countries were not part of the Warsaw Pact. This pattern persisted during the 1990s, when the fund helped former communist countries in their transition to market economies.

In a highly competitive global economy, employee diversity offers a proven route for innovation and organizational performance. While it is generally accepted that the gender should be no barrier on equal pay for work requiring equal skills, efforts, responsibilities, and working conditions, women are still under-represented at all levels of the companies around the world. Furthermore, unequal pay for equal job implemented by both qualified men and women results in gender discrimination in the career development of women in the labor market. Gender discrimination holds capable women from further personal growth and contribution to economic development. This problem particularly revals itself in the banking and financial sector. This study examines the impact of the Great Recession on the gender wage gap. Using the U.S. Census American Community Survey microdata for bank employees from 2001 to 2017, the study will analyze the changes in the pay gap between male and female employees in the financial sector, before and after the Great Recession.",TRUE,FALSE,Banking Sector|Gender|Pay Gap|Recession,2020-02-13T18:08:41.949120,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-13T18:08:17.542797,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d05|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Women's Studies",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/citation/,hgzev,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e44a300d66221003599118a/,5e44a300d66221003599118a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgzev/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hgzev/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hgzev

This study examines the emergence of the crack epidemic in the mid-1980s and city-to-suburb mobility between and within ethno-racial groups. Using the 1980 and 1990 IPUMS data, I compare the mean and dispersion of city-to-suburban mobility before and during the period of the crack epidemic in cities with high intensity of the epidemic relative to cities with low intensity. The results suggest that the crack epidemic increased black and Hispanic flight to the suburbs, but it did not increase white flight. Furthermore, the crack epidemic increased disparity in city-to-suburb mobility among blacks. I find that the source of this heterogeneity is middle-class black migrants who fled to the suburbs. Supporting evidence is consistent with the idea that the crack epidemic changed the location of business establishments from the inner-city to the suburbs, which results in greater economic returns to city-to-suburb migration among selective demographic groups who were heavily affected by the crack epidemic but had resources to migrate. Given the historically lower rates of suburbanization among blacks and Hispanics, the results suggest that the crack epidemic decreased suburbanization inequality between minorities and whites but increased suburbanization inequality among blacks.",TRUE,FALSE,between and within group inequality|city-to-suburb mobility|crack epidemic|quasi-experiment|residential attainment,2020-02-13T18:17:01.566386,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-13T18:16:31.479567,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/citation/,wkxqv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4461b7d66221000998f4ea/,5e4461b7d66221000998f4ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkxqv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wkxqv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wkxqv

We show two effects of changing a ``hearing pivot"" justice who is decisive for case selection. First, as this justice becomes more extreme, the court hears a larger set of policies. That is, as the hearing pivot becomes more conservative, the court hears more cases with liberal status quo precedents. Second, as the hearing pivot becomes more extreme, dispositional majorities shrink and rulings are more polarized. When the median justice becomes more extreme without changing the hearing pivot, rulings become more extreme as the majority opinion shifts. Yet, the set of cases heard changes very little. Finally, we show that changing non-pivotal justices also affects case selection. If an extreme justice is replaced with someone even more extreme, this may expand the gridlock interval. Extreme justices pull the bargaining policy away from the hearing pivot, thus making status quo precedents more appealing.",TRUE,FALSE,Pivots|Rule of Four|Supreme Court,2020-02-12T14:23:21.305365,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-12T14:23:09.442824,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/citation/,fr4yq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e431a27a057ec00a3b047d6/,5e431a27a057ec00a3b047d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr4yq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fr4yq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fr4yq

Candidates for office choose a level of policy concessions to grant to interest groups. Interest groups then contribute to campaigns to help elect their preferred candidates. Our results offer predictions about equilibrium campaign spending, the probability a given candidate wins, and the level of policy concessions as a function of the ideological distribution of politicians and interest groups. Campaign spending increases as interest groups and candidates become more extreme relative to the median voter. In contrast, the probability a given candidate wins depends (negatively) on ideological alignment with an allied interest group. We then show that when parties can nominate candidates, they choose to nominate the most moderate candidate but choose to pair her with the most extreme interest group.",TRUE,FALSE,Campaigns|Lobbying|Special Interest Groups,2020-02-12T14:22:41.029303,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-12T14:22:21.581555,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/citation/,awjpb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4318ae7610e100adca387a/,5e4318ae7610e100adca387a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awjpb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/awjpb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/awjpb
