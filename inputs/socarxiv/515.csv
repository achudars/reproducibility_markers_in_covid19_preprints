As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart’ urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey’s growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey’s multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city’s hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to ~9,000 and ~124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 minutes by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as ~8,000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city’s schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 minutes by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and ‘smart’ urban investment strategies.",TRUE,FALSE,equity|open-source data|smart cities|transportation,2018-07-02T11:53:44.568059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T14:49:15.010204,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Mayaud|J.

Strategic Action, Temporality, and the Expansion of US Higher Education","The massive expansion of US higher education after World War II is a sociological puzzle: a spectacular feat of state capacity-building in a highly federated polity. Prior scholarship names academic leaders as key drivers of this expansion, yet the conditions for the possibility and fate of their activity remain under-specified. We fill this gap by theorizing what Randall Collins first called educational entrepreneurship as a special kind of strategic action in the US polity. We argue that the cultural authority and organizational centrality of universities in the US national context combine with historical contingency to episodically produce conditions under which academic credentials can be made viable solutions to social problems. We put our theorization to the test by revisiting and extending a paradigmatic case: the expansion of engineering education at Stanford University between 1945 and 1969. Invoking several contemporaneous and subsequent cases, we demonstrate the promise of theorizing educational expansion as an outcome of strategic action by specifically located actors over time.",TRUE,FALSE,credentialism|entrepreneurship|field theory|higher education|historical sociology|organizational theory|political sociology|science policy|strategic action,2018-07-02T11:53:44.485001,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-30T20:18:51.175487,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf029000zm/,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/citation/,pd8c4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0efa0964f25a000d72bef7/,5b0efa0964f25a000d72bef7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pd8c4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pd8c4,NA

This paper tries to move beyond this limitation and discusses data-based value creation in data-intensive infrastructures, such as social media, by focusing on processes of data generation, use and reuse, and on infrastructure development activities. Building on current debates in value theory, the paper develops a multidimensional value framework to interrogate the data collected in an embedded ethnographical case study of the development of PatientsLikeMe, a social media network for patients. It asks when, and where, value is created from the data, and what kinds of value are created from them, as they move through the data infrastructure; and how infrastructure evolution relates to, and shapes, existing data-based value creation practices. The findings show that infrastructure development can have unpredictable consequences for data-based value creation, shaping shared practices in complex ways and through a web of interdependent situations. The paper argues for an understanding of infrastructural innovation that accounts for the situational interdependencies of data use and reuse. Uniquely positioned, the paper demonstrates the importance of research that looks critically into processes of data use in infrastructures to keep abreast of the social consequences of developments in big data and data analytics aimed at exploiting all kinds of digital traces for multiple purposes.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|crowdsourcing|data-intensive infrastructures|data reuse|information infrastructures|infrastructural innovation|infrastructure development|social media|value|value creation,2018-07-02T11:53:43.999978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-30T15:05:05.381154,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/citation/,msvqh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n78jp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/relationships/node/,n78jp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0eaac172e399000fb2bba8/,5b0eaac172e399000fb2bba8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/msvqh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/msvqh,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infoandorg.2017.08.001

New analyses of the dynamic effects of own and reference income on life satisfaction,"Do people adapt to changes in income? In contradiction to much of the previous literature, I find no evidence of adaptation to income in GSOEP (1984-2015) and UKHLS (1996-2017) data. Furthermore, I find that people also do not adapt to changes in reference income. Instead, reference income effects may be subject to reinforcement over time. Following the empirical approach of Vendrik (2013), I obtain these findings by estimating life satisfaction equations in which contemporaneous and lagged terms for a respondent’s own household income and their estimated reference income are simultaneously entered. Additionally, I instrument for own income and include lags of a large set of controls. What was found to be adaptation to raw household income in previous studies turns out to
have been driven by reinforcement of an initially small negative effect of household size that grows large over time.

Software documentation for these libraries is crucial in helping programmers/analysts know what libraries are available and how to use them. Yet documentation for open source software libraries is widely considered low-quality. This article is a collaboration between CSCW researchers and contributors to data analytics OSS libraries, based on ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative interviews. We examine several issues around the formats, practices, and challenges around documentation in these largely volunteer-based projects. There are many different kinds and formats of documentation that exist around such libraries, which play a variety of educational, promotional, and organizational roles. The work behind documentation is similarly multifaceted, including writing, reviewing, maintaining, and organizing documentation. Different aspects of documentation work require contributors to have different sets of skills and overcome various social and technical barriers. Finally, most of our interviewees do not report high levels of intrinsic enjoyment for doing documentation work (compared to writing code). Their motivation is affected by personal and project-specific factors, such as the perceived level of credit for doing documentation work versus more `technical' tasks like adding new features or fixing bugs. In studying documentation work for data analytics OSS libraries, we gain a new window into the changing practices of data-intensive research, as well as help practitioners better understand how to support this often invisible and infrastructural work in their projects.",TRUE,FALSE,collaboration|documentation|ethnography|infrastructure|invisible work|motivations|open source|open source software|peer production|standards,2018-07-02T11:53:41.855670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-29T17:01:31.043629,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/citation/,2fdhr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ypexd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/relationships/node/,ypexd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0d52238811f3001280ac1c/,5b0d52238811f3001280ac1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fdhr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2fdhr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2fdhr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1

Shell matrix sites comprise a key component of the coastal archaeological record. The extensive nature of many shell matrix sites presents challenges for archaeological sampling regimes. While large-scale excavation is undesirable and impractical, limited test pits often represent only a tiny fraction of large shell deposits and are rarely considered representative. This study transforms GPR data into three-dimensional models which form the basis of deposit volume estimates. Volume estimates are evaluated against excavation data to test their accuracy. Results demonstrate that this novel methodology can generate accurate three-dimensional representations of buried shell matrices and highly accurate volume estimations with error margins of 3.5% ± 7%. It is recommended, though, that more inclusive error margins of 19.5% ± 17% are used to account for potential error, especially where results cannot be verified. This greater understanding of the extent and structural variability of deposits can be utilised to create robust sampling strategies for excavation. The methodology could also be further employed to enhance comparative regional studies and to add to conservation and management practices of buried shell matrix sites. If applied more widely this methodology will not only benefit our understanding of shell matrix deposits but also the wider archaeological record of coastal regions worldwide.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|Australia|geophysics|ground-penetrating radar|shell matrix|shell midden,2018-07-02T13:33:17.384924,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-29T17:00:53.321794,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/citation/,c7nzf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wjq8s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/relationships/node/,wjq8s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0c4c53febe5e0013a5e19a/,5b0c4c53febe5e0013a5e19a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7nzf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c7nzf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c7nzf,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.12.015

Within this, peer review of research articles remains an essential part of the formal publication process, distinguishing it from virtually all other modes of communication. In the last several years, there has been an explosive wave of innovation in peer review research, platforms, discussions, tools, and services. This is largely coupled with the ongoing and parallel evolution of scholarly communication as it adapts to rapidly changing environments, within what is widely considered as the ‘open research’ or ‘open science’ movement. Here, we summarise the current ebb and flow around changes to peer review and consider its role in a modern digital research and communications infrastructure and discuss why uptake of new models of peer review appears to have been so low compared to what is often viewed as the ‘traditional’ method of peer review. Finally, we offer some insight into the potential futures of scholarly peer review and consider what impacts this might have on the broader scholarly research ecosystem.",TRUE,FALSE,Peer Review|Scholarly Communication|Scholarly Publishing|Web 2.0,2018-07-02T13:33:17.221913,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-29T14:49:16.903115,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/citation/,c29tm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cgmpx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/relationships/node/,cgmpx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0c227a8811f300127fbcbf/,5b0c227a8811f300127fbcbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c29tm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c29tm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c29tm,https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fny204
