What consequences does this have for income pooling? 
We compare ca. 130,000 married and cohabiting couples from 29 European countries in the 2010 European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) via random effects logit models. We show that cohabiting couples are generally more likely than married couples to keep at least some income separately, the so-called cohabitation gap.  Roughly a fifth of this gap we can attribute to compositional differences between married and cohabiting couples.  Further, the cohabiting group is heterogeneous and smaller when comparing only couples with children or only couples with a long relationship duration.  Lastly, we show that there is substantial variation in the size of the cohabitation gap across countries.  The size of this gap varies with the country-specific cohabitation rate, divorce rate, and female labor force participation rate. While there is considerable heterogeneity among cohabiting couples, married and cohabiting couples remain distinct in their resource-sharing behavior.  Income pooling does not become more comparable when cohabitation, marital instability, and women’s economic independence become more widespread in the broader society.  Our study reconciles disparate findings of previous cross-national research on the cohabitation gap.",TRUE,FALSE,Cohabitation|Family dynamics|Income pooling|Marriage|Resource-sharing,2019-04-26T13:52:43.438774,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-26T13:51:47.388395,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,The authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/citation/,rqzj3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xpq74/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/relationships/node/,xpq74,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc30ab59e074500166464a8/,5cc30ab59e074500166464a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqzj3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rqzj3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rqzj3,NA

Yet unstudied is Western migration to the Philippines, a developing nation with numerous disadvantages for residents and from which many locals emigrate. The present study aimed to estimate numbers and demographic characteristics of Westerners living there and some motives for and outcomes of their move. From various embassy estimates, perhaps 218,350 Westerners not of Filipino descent lived in the Philippines in 2014. Some Western migrants were studied in- country and 134 completed a survey. Most survey respondents were well-educated male retirees who had paired up with a local woman. Major migration motives were low living costs, a warm climate, dislike of a home nation and availability of attractive partners. Reported outcomes of moving to the Philippines varied greatly. Some do not adjust well and quickly leave while others are dissatisfied but lack funds to exit. However, some apparently integrate well.

This capacity demands both opacity respect—preserving a gap between the self we present and the self we conceal—and an ability to call into question practices that are ethically wanting. Pushed to its limit, the smooth optimisation of our environment may prevent us from experiencing many of the tensions that otherwise prompt us to reconsider accepted practices. An optimally personalised world may not ever call for any ‘action’ as Hannah Arendt describes it.

Can systems be designed to personalise responsibly? Greater time and research needs to be invested in designing a range of viable ‘perspective widening’ tools, as many such tools either burden users with little guarantee of meaningful engagement, or underestimate the extent to which individuals’ preferences are themselves malleable. Any approach that tries to predict what users might like, or what might change their views, risks the same pitfalls as any other form of personalisation. Instead, we argue that the most promising avenue is to push for diverse uses of newly developed systems, and measure those systems’ success at least partly on that basis. Inviting appropriation  and repurposing would help keep users engaged in systems of data collection and profiling. This will not be a straightforward task: sometimes it will be in tension with traditional measures of success and performance.

The goal of this paper is to better comprehend and discover the ways in which math anxiety in PSETs impacts their teaching and whether there are ways to limit these negative emotions about mathematics. Much of the research on this topic look at either PSETs’ beliefs/views or their teaching practices. The focus of this paper will be to analyze the relationship between their beliefs/views and their teaching such to look at how one influences the other or if they have a symbiotic relationship as well as looking at how one’s individual psychology influences these beliefs/views. Using a symbolic interactionist lens, the arguments provide evidence from the literature that looks at the relationships between people and others.

I ask how Casamançais use diverse repertoires to get by in everyday life in both Casamance, Senegal and Catalonia, Spain. The concept of conviviality stresses fragile, dynamic processes characteristic of everyday ways of living together with maintained difference. I argue that minimal, but diversified language practices, which compose linguistically diverse repertoires, are central in facilitating conviviality among local residents. Minimal interactions and ‘small talk’, or phatic communion, cushion potentially conflictual socio-cultural differences and inequalities. Firstly, I will evaluate discourses on multilingual practices of Casamançais in both contexts. Second, I will critically explore the reasons for and quality of the widespread use of diverse repertoires. I conclude that multilingual practices facilitate phatic communion sometimes playfully and sometimes as part of coping strategies in situations in which structural forces determine which choices will be more successful than others.

Understanding and being able to utilize these Guidelines (GLs) is relevant for all applications of statistical and data science methodologies – whether for true “research” (following the scientific method) or for business or other predictive/decision-making support.

This article describes how to employ the case study method to teach the ASA GLs, using simple vignettes and a specific tool called a “stakeholder analysis template”. The template is introduced as a method for understanding the harms and benefits, as well as the stakeholders, in each of a series of tasks common to the collection, analysis/manipulation, and drawing of inferences or conclusions based on data in any shape or size. The ASA Ethical Guidelines are discussed with respect to their potential to guide data collection and munging (two specific tasks), with three learning objectives: 1. describe how different individuals (“stakeholders”) may be affected by decisions and actions; 2. enumerate harms and benefits that are most clearly relevant for each stakeholder with respect to the activity; and 3. identify which ASA GL Principles (and/or specific elements) seem most relevant to this activity. The stakeholder analysis template is intended to facilitate teaching and learning – and the ultimate utility – of the ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-04-23T20:43:48.195949,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23T20:43:24.846489,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/citation/,58umw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf6ed5d9de11001e7f2cae/,5cbf6ed5d9de11001e7f2cae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58umw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58umw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58umw,NA

The concept will be defined, particularly with respect to what about stewardship can be demonstrated by the practitioner so that others – including other stewards – can recognize this professional identity. Stewardship is an important aspect of professionalism, and although data science is a very new profession, its growth in terms of the number of practitioners should also include growth in the commitment to integrity in practice. Although an undergraduate program may seem early to begin understanding what this commitment means, and how to generate evidence of that commitment for yourself, those with a strong understanding of stewardship and how to recognize it will be better able to select jobs in contexts where this commitment to integrity is nurtured and valued. Learning about stewardship engages students in taking responsibility for their role in the profession, and so taking responsibility for the profession and the professional community. Once the construct is understood, learners can focus on the nature of the evidence they can compile - as well as the types of activities that can generate that kind of evidence- and on why this is meaningful over their career.",TRUE,FALSE,Stewardship; Mastery Rubric for Stewardship; Data Science; ethical practice; data ethics,2019-04-23T20:44:01.586693,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23T20:43:44.814494,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/citation/,j7h8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/relationships/node/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf661b870f9f00181fa546/,5cbf661b870f9f00181fa546,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7h8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j7h8t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j7h8t,NA

This study explores the implications of this ambiguity for two important individual outcomes: subjective social status and perceived financial situation. We study the diverse sample of immigrants in the European Social Survey and use the fact that, due to country differences in educational distributions, a given education level can entail a very different rank in the sending and receiving countries. We document a robust relationship whereby immigrants who ranked higher in the origin than in the destination country see themselves as being comparatively worse off. This finding suggests that the social position before migration provides an important reference point by which immigrants judge their success in the new country.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-04-23T20:44:28.765536,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23T20:44:05.736871,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/citation/,qr5h7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf374720c6e00018ca90b9/,5cbf374720c6e00018ca90b9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qr5h7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qr5h7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qr5h7,NA
