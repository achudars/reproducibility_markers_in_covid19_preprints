The “scripted approach,” used to effect the routine removal of noncitizens in most of the completed cases observed, entails judges’ recitation of well-rehearsed narratives regarding the limited legal rights and remedies available to noncitizens. The “extemporaneous approach” involves judges moving beyond their scripts and deliberating in greater depth about noncitizens’ cases. In doing so, judges’ personal attitudes, biases, and motivations are often revealed as they articulate their desire to circumvent the removal process for noncitizens they view as “deserving” of relief—but for whom only temporary relief from removal is often available given judges’ interpretations of immigration law. Although judges recognize that this temporary relief may allow some noncitizens to remain in the United States indefinitely, incomplete protection from removal can leave noncitizens in a precarious legal status and jeopardize these individuals' future opportunities for legalization. These findings support a conceptualization of immigration judges as street-level bureaucrats, or frontline workers who interpret the law—sometimes unevenly—in order to enforce government policy while interfacing with the individuals subject to said policy, and amplify the social control capacity of the federal immigration regime.",TRUE,FALSE,Dallas|decision-making|deportation|ethnography|immigration judges|immigration law|removal|street-level bureaucrats|Texas|United States,2018-11-08T17:23:41.001044,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-08T17:23:21.773001,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c10|Law|Judges|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Other Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology",Asad L.

We put these findings into context by comparing search frequencies with other popular Google searches about sexuality and otherwise.

In so doing, the paper critiques the conception of ludic as anti-hegemonic in the Bakhtian tradition, and develops an emic term ‘gaali’ to signal the blurred boundaries between comedy, insult, shame and abuse emerging on online media which also incite gendered forms of intimidation.

At the same time, researchers are becoming aware of the importance of community-collaborative research. However, in Canada, many researchers receive little formal training on how to collaboratively conduct research with Indigenous communities. This is particularly problematic for early-career researchers (ECRs) whose fieldwork often involves interacting with communities. To address this lack of training, two peer-led workshops for Canadian ECRs were organized in 2016 and 2017 with the following objectives: (a) to cultivate awareness about Indigenous cultures, histories and languages; (b) to promote sharing of Indigenous and non-Indigenous ways of knowing; and (c) to foster approaches and explore tools for conducting community collaborative research. Here we present these peer-led Intercultural Indigenous Workshops and discuss workshop outcomes according to five themes: scope and interdisciplinarity, Indigenous representation, workshop environment, skillful moderation and workshop outcomes. We show that peer-led workshops are an effective way for ECRs to cultivate cultural awareness, learn about diverse ways of knowing, and share collaborative research tools and approaches. Developing this skill set is important for ECRs aiming to conduct community-collaborative research, however broader efforts are needed to shift toward more inclusive research paradigms in Canada.",TRUE,FALSE,collaborative research|cultural awareness|early-career researchers|Indigenous communities|peer-led training|workshop evaluation,2018-11-10T13:27:25.291788,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-10T13:26:46.565400,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education,Gwyneth A.

Development projects worldwide are increasingly required to quantify and fully mitigate their impacts on biodiversity, with an objective of achieving ‘no net loss’ or a ‘net gain’ (NNL/NG) of biodiversity overall. Seeking NNL/NG outcomes can affect people because society relies on, uses and values biodiversity. However these social impacts are often not adequately considered, even when development projects mitigate their broader social impacts. This document outlines good practice principles for addressing the social impacts that arise from all losses and gains in biodiversity from a development project and its NNL/NG activities. It aims to:
•	Define measurable social outcomes from biodiversity NNL/NG.
•	Provide a framework for assessing whether the social aspects of biodiversity NNL/NG have been designed and implemented in accordance with good practice.
•	Facilitate closer working between all stakeholders involved with biodiversity NNL/NG projects, especially between ecological and social specialists, throughout a project.
The principles in this document are founded on international best practice that calls for development projects to achieve biodiversity NNL/NG while ensuring that affected people are ‘no worse off and preferably better off’. They are intended to set a high standard, which may be aspirational for some projects in practice. They build on existing literature and guidance, and reflect a substantial diversity of views captured during an extensive consultation process. However, we expect that they will undergo further refinement when tested in the field. The authors welcome feedback.
Development projects seeking biodiversity NNL/NG should achieve an outcome whereby:
People perceive the components of their wellbeing affected by biodiversity losses and gains to be at least as good as a result of the development project and associated biodiversity NNL/NG activities, than if the development had not been implemented. 
To achieve this the following principles should be followed:
1.	Measure change in wellbeing.
2.	Focus on affected people within the project’s area of influence.
3.	Maintain the desired social outcomes from NNL/NG throughout the project’s lifetime.
4.	Compare social outcomes from NNL/NG against an appropriate reference scenario.
5.	Exceed existing obligations to achieve the desired social outcomes from NNL/NG.
6.	Assess wellbeing for defined groups of people e.g. by gender or interest.
7.	Benefit the people who have been affected.
8.	Align the biodiversity and social objectives of NNL/NG.
9.	Achieve equitable social outcomes from NNL/NG.
10.	Avoid impacts on wellbeing that are deemed unacceptable by the people affected and cannot be compensated for.
11.	Design and implement social aspects of NNL/NG with inclusive stakeholder engagement.
12.	Ensure biodiversity and social specialists collaborate on NNL/NG.
13.	Implement effective conflict-resolution mechanisms.
14.	Monitor social outcomes from NNL/NG throughout.

In the late 1980s, Dunnell proposed a solution to this conundrum. He suggested that wasting energy confers an adaptive advantage in highly variable environments. This hypothesis has been used to explain several instances of monument building but it has only been evaluated once and that study suggested it is flawed. Here, we report a series of experiments in which we used an agent-based model to assess the hypothesis while taking into account two factors that could enhance the adaptiveness of waste—restricted agent movement and spatial structure in resource availability. Waste was strongly selected against in most of the experiments. Two experiments suggested that very restricted mobility can select for waste, but this effect disappeared when environmental variation increased from moderate to high. Thus, our experiments also suggest that the waste hypothesis is flawed.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|Agent-based modelling|Cultural elaboration|Environmental variability|Evolutionary archaeology|Monuments|Robert Dunnell|Waste hypothesis,2018-11-05T19:46:20.687826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-05T19:45:54.835853,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,William Christopher Carleton|Andre Costopoulos|Mark Collard,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/citation/,zr5k3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gd6js/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/relationships/node/,gd6js,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be07dc85736490018865e24/,5be07dc85736490018865e24,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zr5k3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zr5k3

For that purpose, we focus on explanatory sequential designs, where a quantitative strand of research is followed by a qualitative strand of research (Creswell, 2009). This is a common research design found in MMMR where quantitative results are further explained using qualitative methods (Schoonenboom, Johnson, &amp; Froehlich, 2018). For instance, a survey may be followed by in-depth interviews with individuals from the survey population to help with contextualizing and interpreting the results. We report how R Markdown, a tool for report automation based on R (Froehlich, 2018b; Xie, 2013), may be used to increase research efficiency when applying such designs. We strongly believe that the quantitative strands of explanatory sequential designs lend themselves to such automation in order to free up resources for the (often labor intensive) qualitative strand. Next to increasing research efficiency, this measure is also helpful in aiding practitioners that do want to apply scientific methods, but do not possess the necessary in-depth knowledge about (quantitative) research methods.",TRUE,FALSE,automation|innovation|research methods|RMarkdown|SNA|social network analysis,2018-11-06T20:56:05.058656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-06T20:55:46.024854,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4f|Education|Vocational Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Dominik E.
