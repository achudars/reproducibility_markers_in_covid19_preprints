By constricting Internet access to potential challengers, governments can reduce the need to censor (since anti-regime content would be less likely to be produced and read) and also the need for large infrastructure shutdowns (which may harm the government). Cross-national work shows that political exclusion is associated with significantly lower rates of connectivity for the affected groups, but cannot tell us whether this pattern is because governments strategically limiting Internet access of the political opposition. We test this mechanism with a field experiment in Belarus. We email support centers of the national telecommunications provider and vary partisan cues in our emails. In line

The present study applies phenomenological analysis to 28 semi-structured interviews with victims of hate crime.

Evidence from the Australian ‘Clean Energy Future’ policy, July 2012 to June 2014","Aviation emissions are an important contributor to global climatic change. As growth in travel demand continues to outstrip improvements in the fuel efficiency of air travel, the aviation contribution to climate change is likely to grow substantially. Consequently, measures that effectively reduce travel demand are required if atmospheric carbon concentrations are to be limited. The efficacy of the Australian Clean Energy Future policy which placed a $23.00AUD (FY 2012) to $24.15 AUD (FY 2013) per tonne levy on carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions from July 2012 to June 2014 is tested. Specifically, time-series regression is used to estimate the effect of this carbon price policy on the level of domestic passenger kilometres flown in Australia, while adjusting for costs of production (i.e. fuel and labour costs), economic activity (i.e. gross domestic product), competitive effects (i.e. airline capacity), and exogenous shocks. There was no evidence that the carbon price reduced the level of domestic aviation in Australia. Carbon pricing measures may have to be levied at a greater rate to affect behavioural change, particularly given the limited potential for future aviation efficiency gains.",TRUE,FALSE,Air travel|Australia|Aviation|Carbon pricing|Climate change|Emissions,2018-07-02T11:57:48.563073,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-27T00:30:10.709074,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/citation/,2mnxh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mtbdq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/relationships/node/,mtbdq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b32d77edaf8210012dbbba6/,5b32d77edaf8210012dbbba6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mnxh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2mnxh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2mnxh,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.06.008

Instead, I conduct a historical, comparative analysis on the pre-movement activities of evangelical Christian communities in these two countries from 1925-1975. Employing insights from historical institutionalism, I identify two critical junctures in the historical development of evangelical communities that suppressed the entrepreneurship and institution-building activities of Canadian evangelicals relative to those in the United States. I find that these divergences in institution building affected the size and strength of the institutional infrastructures—supportive organizations, networks, and resources—of the religious right movements in these countries.

One of the lesser-known of these burials is that found at Kostënki 18, in the Kostënki-Borshchëvo region on the Don river near Voronezh. At this site, a lithic assemblage attributed to the Kostënki-Avdeevo Culture was also found, but no direct stratigraphic connection could be established between the burial and the lithic assemblage. In this paper we describe this burial and present a new direct date for the human remains obtained using the single amino acid (hydroxyproline) method. The new date provides support for the hypothesis that the burial and lithic assemblage found at Kostënki 18 are linked. We also briefly discuss the significance of the Russian Upper Palaeolithic burial record for the understanding of early burials across Europe.",TRUE,FALSE,burials|funerary archaeology|Gravettian|Palaeolithic|Paleolithic|radiocarbon dating|Russia|Upper Palaeolithic|Upper Paleolithic,2018-07-02T11:57:45.278035,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-25T15:32:00.326465,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/citation/,3buq9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gwbzp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/relationships/node/,gwbzp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b30f471d65eaa000edf2cc9/,5b30f471d65eaa000edf2cc9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3buq9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3buq9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3buq9,https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2017.150

Using Geomagic Design X (reverse-engineering software) and Geomagic Verify (inspection software), metrics associated with rotational asymmetry were generated and analyzed. Future directions include the incorporation of directional and fluctuating asymmetry measures of the widest vessel profiles, which were calculated in Design X then analyzed using the geomorph package in R. Preliminary results point toward gainful results that can be used to augment more traditional ceramic analyses as well as geometric morphometric studies of ceramic vessel shape.",TRUE,FALSE,3D|asymmetry|ceramics|geometric morphometrics|symmetry,2018-07-02T11:57:42.546170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:31:23.951518,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/citation/,6atz3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uadtg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/relationships/node/,uadtg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2e2fbddaf8210011d45486/,5b2e2fbddaf8210011d45486,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6atz3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6atz3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6atz3,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.daach.2017.04.003

in improving students' ability to recall and spell newly learned vocabulary items. The researcher
only considered three types of MSs: grouping, placing new words in to a context and structured
reviewing. In addition, the study used a questionnaire that explored students' attitudes towards
MSs in general, and towards the specific MSs that they have been trained to use, as well as the
relationship between MSs and motivation and between MSs and anxiety.  intact groups (63 students in total) were selected from level three of the College of Languages and Translation (COLT) at King Saud University (KSU), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The two groups were assigned to the experimental group (36 students) and the control group(27students). The control group received traditional instruction that depended on the textbook without any MS training, whereas the experimental group received a combination of traditional instruction and MS training. A pre- and post-test were administered to both groups before and after the experiment to examine students' ability to recall the meaning of vocabulary items and their ability to spell them correctly. The experiment lasted for fourteen weeks through which the participants received seven MS training sessions. The study found out that MS training was effective in improving students' ability to recall the meaning of vocabulary items when needed and their ability to spell them correctly. Moreover, the results showed that the subjects of the experimental group showed positive attitude towards MSs and most of them agreed on the positive effect that MSs had on raising their motivation and reducing their anxiety while learning vocabulary.",TRUE,FALSE,|anxiety|effectiveness|memory strategies|translation|vocabulary,2018-07-02T11:57:42.433869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:30:17.625146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/citation/,5vhrq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sw9pr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/relationships/node/,sw9pr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dec2cdaf8210012d552c7/,5b2dec2cdaf8210012d552c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5vhrq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5vhrq,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.205
