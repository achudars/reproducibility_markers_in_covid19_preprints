The relevant literature on refugee politics has yet to fully explore how forced migration encourages host states to employ their position in order to extract revenue from other state or non-state actors for maintaining refugee groups within their borders. This article explores the workings of refugee rentier states, namely states seeking to leverage their position as host states of displaced communities for material gain. It focuses on the Syrian refugee crisis, examining the foreign-policy responses of three major host states – Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. While all three engaged in post-2011 refugee rent-seeking behavior, Jordan and Lebanon deployed a backscratching strategy based on bargains, while Turkey deployed a blackmailing strategy based on threats. Employing primary sources in English and Arabic, the article inductively examines how the choice of strategy depended on the host state’s size of refugee community and domestic elites’ perception of their state’s geostrategic importance vis-à-vis the target state(s). The article concludes with a discussion on the significance of its findings for understanding the international dimension of the Syrian refugee crisis and paves the way for future research on the effects of forced displacement on host states’ political development.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab migration|Arab world|Case Studies|Eastern Mediterranean|Forced Displacement|Mediterranean refugee crisis|Middle East|Migration|Migration Diplomacy|Refugee Diplomacy|Refugee Rentierism|Refugee Rentier States|Refugees|Rentier states|Rentier state theory|Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees integration,2019-01-05T04:45:41.732996,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:45:25.308960,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/citation/,a6s58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2fb82c00b540001dfe0fd3/,5c2fb82c00b540001dfe0fd3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6s58/,https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogz016,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6s58

I argue that economically driven cross-border mobility generates reciprocal political economy effects on sending and host states. That is, it produces migration interdependence. Host states may leverage their position against a sending state by either deploying strategies of restriction—curbing remittances, strengthening immigration controls, or both—or displacement—forcefully expelling citizens of the sending state. These strategies’ success depends on whether the sending state is vulnerable to the political economy costs incurred by host states’ strategy, namely if it is unable to absorb them domestically and cannot procure the support of alternative host states. I also contend that displacement strategies involve higher costs than restriction efforts and are therefore more likely to succeed. I demonstrate my claims through a least-likely, two-case study design of Libyan and Jordanian coercive migration diplomacy against Egypt in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. I examine how two weaker Arab states leveraged their position against Egypt, a stronger state but one vulnerable to migration interdependence, through the restriction and displacement of Egyptian migrants.",TRUE,FALSE,arab migration|Egyptian migrants|Egyptian migration|International Relations and Migration|Middle East|migration and the Arab Spring|migration diplomacy|Mohamed Morsi|North African migration|Politics of Arab migration|Politics of Migration in the Middle East,2019-01-04T19:19:21.126964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T19:19:04.075592,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/citation/,b8eak,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2fa20500b540001afec169/,5c2fa20500b540001afec169,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8eak/,https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqx088,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8eak

We investigate if air pollution is especially detrimental to the health of US state populations characterized by more inequitable distributions of income. In other words, are the populations of states with higher levels of income inequality especially vulnerable to similar levels of air pollution? We use two-way fixed-effects panel regression techniques to analyze longitudinal data for 49 US states and the District of Columbia (2000–2010) to model state-level life expectancy as a function of fine particulate matter, income inequality, and other state-level factors. We estimate models with interaction terms to formally assess whether the association between fine particulate matter and life expectancy varies by level of state income inequality. Across multiple life expectancy outcomes and additive models, states with higher PM2.5 levels tend to exhibit lower average life expectancy. This general pattern is observed with our specifications for raw and weighted PM2.5 and with adjustments for income share of the top 10%, total population, GDP per capita, median household income, median age, percent college degree or higher, percent black, and percent Hispanic/Latino. We also find that the association between state PM2.5 levels and average life expectancy intensifies in states with higher levels of income inequality. More specifically, PM2.5 levels are more detrimental to population life expectancy in states where a higher percentage of income is concentrated in the top 10% of the state income distribution.

I combine and extend relational approaches from gender theory and economic sociology to examine how men’s and women’s behaviors shifted, the resources engendered by behavioral shifts, and how they interpreted and compensated for new behaviors and resources. I show that shifts in Syrian household divisions of labor occurred at the intersection of inequalities in social policies, labor markets, and households. As a result of limited social assistance, the refugee families needed to earn an income within months of their arrival. The Syrian men entered the labor market, in keeping with a breadwinning expectation for their labor, but could only access menial jobs that limited their time and opportunity to learn English. Women, meanwhile, did not enter the labor market full-time and could attend English classes.

While previous work has investigated the demographic diversity of museum staffs and visitors, the diversity of artists in their collections has remained unreported. We conduct the first large-scale study of artist diversity in museums. By scraping the public online catalogs of 18 major U.S. museums, deploying a sample of 10,000 artist records comprising over 9,000 unique artists to crowdsourcing, and analyzing 45,000 responses, we infer artist genders, ethnicities, geographic origins, and birth decades. Our results are threefold. First, we provide estimates of gender and ethnic diversity at each museum, and overall, we find that 85% of artists are white and 87% are men. Second, we identify museums that are outliers, having significantly higher or lower representation of certain demographic groups than the rest of the pool. Third, we find that the relationship between museum collection mission and artist diversity is weak, suggesting that a museum wishing to increase diversity might do so without changing its emphases on specific time periods and regions. Our methodology can be used to broadly and efficiently assess diversity in other fields.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-04T15:12:28.027130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T15:12:03.626023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies",Chad Topaz,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/citation/,nhdmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2e497028af78001a66e613/,5c2e497028af78001a66e613,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nhdmk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nhdmk

The effect of weather on the intensity and spatial distribution of crime,"Despite an extensive literature on weather and crime, the magnitude of weather effects on crime and their implications for practical policing remain unclear. Similarly, the effects of weather on the location of crime have barely been explored empirically. We investigated how weather influences the intensity and spatial distribution of crime in Oslo, the capital of Norway. Geocoded locations of criminal offences were combined with data on temperature, wind, and rain. We used negative binomial count models to assess the effect of weather on the intensity of crime and generalized additive models (GAMs) to test for spatial variations. The intensity and spatial distribution of crime were not very sensitive to weather in Oslo. The largest effect was for drug crimes, for which maximum relative to minimum temperature was related to a single incident increase every six days. No effects were found for dislocation in the spatial models. In Oslo, Norway, weather conditions are of little importance for practical policing. The effects of weather on the intensity of crime are miniscule, and effects on the location of crime even smaller.",TRUE,FALSE,Crime|Drug crime|Generalized Additive Models|Norway|Property crime|Spatial criminology|Violent crime,2019-01-03T19:41:09.950351,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03T19:35:26.709081,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco",The authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/citation/,qrhn4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9esdu/,9esdu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2e1e7ca7c0a7001b3dee7a/,5c2e1e7ca7c0a7001b3dee7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrhn4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qrhn4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qrhn4

It highlights evidence from a case study which investigated the effects of role-playing in MMOGs on communication behaviours among EFL game players. Additionally, findings from the study elucidate the learning principles of good games that incorporate the dynamics of gaming which induce the language learner to be active generators of information, knowledge and language. Essentially the preliminary findings reported affirm the viability of online games as a potential tool for teaching and learning in the 4.0 era, which endeavours to engage the digital natives of the 21st century. The study thus claims that MMOGs in particular the massively multiplayer online role-playing games or MMORPGs can facilitate in providing contextualized and authentic language interaction opportunities in English between online multilingual speakers.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-03T19:38:46.757978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03T19:32:55.817067,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/citation/,mkshn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2d7ee828af78001c653a60/,5c2d7ee828af78001c653a60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkshn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mkshn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mkshn
