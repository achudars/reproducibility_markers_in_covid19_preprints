The objectives of this study are 1) to explain the learning style dominates the reading ability; 2) to explain the implementation of E-6tslearning in teaching reading for the academic purpose; 3) to explain the effectiveness of E-6tslearning as the method in teaching reading for academic purposes. The research design used was 2x3 ANOVA factorial designs. The subject of the study was forty-four third semester students of the English Department of Pekalongan University, Indonesia. Twenty-two students became an experimental class, and twenty-two students became control class. The experimental was treated by using the E-6tslearning method, and the control class was given the lecturing. The result shows that the visual learning style dominated the reading ability. The dominant reason was that seeing the text and images make them focused. The E-6tslearning method was applied well online by the lecturer. It was done in and out of the class so that the students have more time to read and write. The use of 6TS method was effective to teach reading proven by the increased score of the experimental class.

They can also recreate their own identities in the course of their interaction. This study investigates ways in which the identities of speakers can be revealed by their use of language in multiple-participant conversations. In particular, the study aims to elicit the strategies that speakers employ the most by analysing the way they talk at a micro-analytic level, and the ways in which they organise and sequence their turns at talking. The results show that the processes of turn-taking and topic development are subject to distraction and breakdown in computer-mediated environments. There are many instances of pauses caused by frequent overlaps between participants. The accents of participants are considered the main feature which can constitute one’s identity in voice-based chat-rooms. Other factors such as communication and technical skills, systems and server speeds could also have an effect on such communication. Additionally, the participants seem to employ certain strategies to overcome interactional limitations of CMC systems, such as the use of pauses, quiet and loud intonation, and stress of particular syllables of some words.

Students’ success in today’s learning lies on their ability to utilize technology as the heart of globalizationas well as to communicate in English effectively within a variety of purposes.  Project-based learning, as one of the technology-based activities, is believed to be an effective method to facilitate the use of technology and oral communication skill in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. This article investigates whether there is a significant difference in students’ speaking ability between students taught through PBL using e-poster and those taught through conventional method. It also determines whether there is a significant difference in students speaking ability between extrovert and introvert students taught through PBL using e-poster. Sixty-one Indonesian secondary level students from two intact classes were involved and assigned randomly into experimental and control groups. The quantitative data were collected through pre-test and post-test from both groups.

There are various factors that cause language anxiety, the most common of which include learners’ excessive self-consciousness and self-awareness concerning their oral reproduction and performance and their peculiar, and quite often misplaced and mistaken, views and beliefs regarding different approaches. Other potential reasons for this problem could include the fear, and the consequent deterrence occasioned thereof, of encountering difficulties in language learning, specifically learners’ individual problems regarding the culture of the target language and the varying social statuses of speakers. The most important fear is, perhaps, the deterrent fear of causing damage to one’s self-identity. Therefore, while needing to paying special attention to language learners’ anxiety reactions, language teachers have a crucial role in helping their students achieve the expected performance goals in the target language. Another factor that could potentially lead to language anxiety is simply the poor command of the target language. This problem could be attributed to linguistic barriers and obstacles language learners encounter in learning and using the target language. In the current study, using a qualitative, semi-structured interview and the focus-group discussion technique, the researcher aims to investigate the factors that contribute to language anxiety among Arab language learners.

Due to the complicatedness of this skill, many teachers find it difficult to make their learners aware of the divergent phases of writing so they produce better compositions. Thus, the professionalism of teachers is inevitably essential in shaping the learners’ writing ability (assisting students as they develop a piece of writing, and boosting their engagement with writing), and learners can achieve successful learning outcomes if they grasp how best to improve their work. To make language learning more effective, there is a need for pursuing professional growth and providing conditions where teachers cooperate to attain higher levels of learning among their students. Indeed, professional development for a teacher is about acquiring new skills, creating a potent learning atmosphere, surmounting the barriers, rectifying the failures and moving forward. It provides ongoing opportunities for educators to continue to identify teaching/learning problems, develop solutions, raise their performance, address students’ needs and up their achievements. The present paper sets out to take a closer look at how teachers work with writing among the first year English as foreign language (EFL) students. It tends to offer an instruction based on a set of professional development methods that provide practitioners with several avenues to implement them in classroom practice.

Recently, interest in English as a means of international communication has increased significantly, it has already been recognized as the language of professional communication in various fields of activity. The relevance of this work is undoubted. Modern higher school teachers are constantly looking for more effective approaches in training English and in the process of creating an electronic educational environment that would allow students access to various sources of information and help satisfy the interests of the modern student. The goal of the research is to increase the efficiency of training English in the system of higher professional education through the development and use of educational software products that apply modern information technology. Methods to achieve this goal include the method of using computer technology, methods of network planning and project management.

The problem of the present study is shown clearly in the answers of Iraqi students of Master of Arts in the College of Education for Women University of Baghdad. In spite of all the previous years of studying English language, some still have the problem of fossilized active and passive simple present tense. The present study aims at shedding light on the reasons behind the Iraqi students’ problem. An error analysis is applied to critically examine the students’ answers in their final course exam of two courses namely; pragmatics and discourse analysis. Depending on Selinker’s model (1972) of error analysis, students errors are all traced back to the language transfer of their native language.

Specifically, the study aims at answering two research questions: Why Saudi do parents chose to speak English to their child/children? And What are the effects of mostly speaking English on the children and their home language: Arabic? A total of ten participating parents took part in this research study where semi structured interviews were utilised to gather the primary data. Thematic analysis of the data revealed three main emerging themes and six subthemes. The findings from the data analysis revealed that Saudi parents speak English with their children so as to allow them the opportunity to be bilingual and linguistically (English – L2) proficient as well as the fact that those parents were pleased to see their children speak English with a British accent. Also, the analysis revealed that that children of Saudi parents speaking English only has led to the weakening and loss of their Arabic L1 language. The study concludes that parents should provide a linguistic balance for their bilingual children in order to preserve the native language. Additionally, the study recommends that further parallel research studies with bilingual children of various L1(s), are conducted.",TRUE,FALSE,Bilingualism|critical period hypothesis|language and identity|language loss,2019-07-20T21:28:25.923107,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:28:07.164243,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/citation/,kzc2t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa3eef08a3bf001a019ae4/,5caa3eef08a3bf001a019ae4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzc2t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kzc2t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kzc2t
