The motivations of suicide combatants, however, are often related to local and familial dynamics; specifically, combatants' primary socialization on violent norms. To better understand suicide attacks, we use a data set of 2,923 individual fighter-level observations of combatants for the Islamic State. These data include individual demographic data and the fighter's role for the Islamic State; including if they volunteered to be a suicide fighter. Through these data, we test several extant theories of suicide combatant mobilization (i.e., ideational or economic incentives) compared to the effect of primary socialization. We find that if a combatant has a sibling that volunteered to be a suicide combatant their odds of volunteering to be a suicide combatant increase by over 1,000 times.

This is not the case for election campaigns, but for the time in-between elections due to reasons for raising funds and other resources. These processes often rely on the digital sphere. Parties are not only challenged by relocating their communication strategies in normal times into new vessels, but also to encounter increased interactional demands by their target groups - members and supporters (Scarrow 2015). This comes along with the well-researched decline of established parties due to different societal causes (van Biezen, Poguntke 2014; Whiteley 2011, Montigny 2015). Parties’ adaptation of information and communication technologies (ICT) poses another challenge: How to migrate into the digital without losing those who are already engaged offline? How can parties manage to get the best out of both worlds – online and offline – and meet the demands of their adherents? These questions are connected to the research of intra-party democracy (e.g. Close et al. 2017; Faucher and Boy 2018; Bernardi et al. 2017) and leadership (Poguntke and Webb 2005; Musella 2018) as well as to research on parties’ virtual presence (e.g. Römmele 2003).
We seek to understand how parties operate online in terms of building relationships between the organization and its members as well as fostering relationships between individual adherents. To grasp what is going on, we analyze parties’ websites and Facebook fan pages. We follow a comparative approach by conducting a pair-comparison. Our cases are the British Conservative Party and the German Christian Democratic Union with a panel data set from 2013 to 2018. Both parties hold governmental responsibility and face national turmoil within their countries. We analyze websites because we assume them serving as a hub of information and exchange for members and supporters. This allows us to investigate how both channels of ICTs are used either to disseminate information or to establish dialogue and discourse on platform media.",TRUE,FALSE,digital parties|election campaigns|facebook|political parties|websites,2019-09-16T19:17:02.176189,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-16T19:16:33.911522,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Isabelle Borucki|Jasmin Fitzpatrick,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/citation/,sh9ej,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7f7288fcbf44001b478064/,5d7f7288fcbf44001b478064,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sh9ej/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sh9ej/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sh9ej

Background: Wealth can be an important resource to deal with the adverse economic consequences of union dissolution. Marital property regimes usually ensure that both partners receive a share of the couples’ wealth following a divorce. The dissolution of cohabiting unions is not governed by such rules in most countries, including Germany, which may lead to a more unequal division of wealth following the dissolution of cohabitation as compared to marriage.
Method: The analysis consists of multivariable fixed-effects regression models based on longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 6,388 individuals) for the years 2002 to 2017.
Results: Changes in wealth are relatively similar for men and women after the dissolution of marriage. The dissolution of cohabiting unions is related to losses in wealth for women, but not for men. Controlling for post-dissolution processes, gender inequality increases after the dissolution of cohabitations.
Conclusion: Union dissolution is associated with wealth losses. The legal protection of the economically weaker spouse in marriage prevents gender inequality in these wealth losses. Lacking such legal protection, cohabitation is associated with gender inequality in the consequences of dissolution.",TRUE,FALSE,Cohabitation|Divorce|Gender Inequality|Separation|Wealth,2019-09-16T19:19:02.163398,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-16T19:18:53.708862,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/citation/,rcuvd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7f6f8a710c95001e59b27a/,5d7f6f8a710c95001e59b27a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rcuvd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rcuvd

Further, Islamic State fighters also come from areas with better economic conditions and regions with politically marginalized and ethnically excluded groups.

Although migration research has established the proximate relationship between armed conflict and increases in migration, much less attention has been paid to the long-term, or distal relationship. This research leverages the case of the 1992-1997 Tajikistani Civil War to examine the distal relationship between armed conflict and migration decisions nearly a decade after the war had ended. Using a series of logistic regression models and a selection-based endogeneity correction, I estimate the likelihood of migrating in 2006, given the intensity of conflict experience at the district level. I find that, controlling for individual, household, and district-level indicators, the legacy of conflict continues to influence migration – for men and for ‘stayers’ – nearly a decade after the peace accord was signed. Some evidence suggests that certain kinds of development projects can moderate this relationship. In conflict-affected countries, incorporating the legacy of conflict into empirical research can help scholars and policy-makers better understand migration in the aftermath of war.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|development|migration|tajikistan,2019-09-15T11:40:46.531953,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-15T11:40:18.493951,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/citation/,qn5xv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7e13d37483ec001851e918/,5d7e13d37483ec001851e918,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qn5xv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qn5xv

This locates two different versions of practice theory in Marx’s “practical question” and Hobbes’ “Kingdom of Darkness,” respectively, and shows how both historically comprise a practical critique of testing reason. This article examines how the practical critique performs a dialectic of politicization and depoliticization that finds family resemblances and paradoxical alignments between the political left and right. The article evaluates the strength of the practical critique and asks whether it results in a power politics with both left and right versions.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-15T11:39:45.522784,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-15T11:39:24.738259,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/citation/,a3dj9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7d24ec710c95001f58ce2d/,5d7d24ec710c95001f58ce2d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3dj9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a3dj9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a3dj9

Political science has introduced a multitude of spectrograms based on different factors, dimensions, axes, and cardinal points.  Most often the graphics do not complement each other, and it seems that each of them describes a completely different reality.  There was an urgent need to conduct an objective analysis of political philosophies and find the factors that influence the political spectrum polarization.  For these purposes, the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was used, as it allows to introduce a fraction of objectivity due to the use of a formalized mathematical apparatus of the theory of sets.   Thirteen main political doctrines were analyzed and obtained that spectrum polarization depends on three conditions: attitude to private property, individual freedom, and wealth redistribution. As the factors that influence the political spectrum polarization were firmly determined, it became possible to build a spectrogram unambiguously.",TRUE,FALSE,Anarchism|Capitalism|Classical Liberalism|Democracy|Econometrics|Economic Freedom|Fascism|Individual Freedom|Marxism|Marxism-Leninism|Nazism|Political Economy|Political Philosophy|Political Science|Political Spectrum|Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)|Socialism|Spectrogram|Syndicalism|Totalitarianism,2019-09-15T11:38:23.236223,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-15T11:37:56.666907,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/citation/,tr8g5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7d1dcc9defac001719778a/,5d7d1dcc9defac001719778a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tr8g5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tr8g5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tr8g5
