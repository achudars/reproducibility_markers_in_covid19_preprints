Covid-19 vaccines are one of the most crucial innovations that help fight against the virus. This paper attempts to revisit the Covid-19 vaccines production process by employing the 3D creativity management theory. The vaccine production could be deemed an information process and classified into three main stages. The first stage involved the processes of absorbing information (e.g., digital data and open science) and rejecting waning information (e.g., misinformation and fake news) for effectively acquiring useful insights. Useful insights were later employed by experts, enterprises, governments, and international organizations through coordinated efforts for developing vaccines within a short period. Finally, the appearance of multiple types of vaccines enabled more strategic options for vaccine distribution and administration. Findings from this vaccine creativity management process could be used as critical lessons for further improvements and efficiency of vaccination programs.",TRUE,FALSE,3D creativity management framework|Covid-19|information process|innovation|social sciences|vaccines,2021-07-02T08:43:01.217900,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-02T08:32:00.157007,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/citation/,4mchu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ddbf9931881a024b63b32e/,60ddbf9931881a024b63b32e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mchu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4mchu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4mchu

We leverage computational techniques to identify more than 166,000 journalist profiles, in English, on Twitter and to examine their beats, follower counts, and volume of activity. We pair this with findings from an original 2019 survey with policy-oriented journalists (N=450) who work on a variety of beats. Two-thirds of journalists believe social media tools help them frequently in their reporting work across many dimensions. Regression analysis finds significant associations with the technology and international affairs beats, as well as among younger journalists and those with a national audience. Our Twitter analysis, based on a dataset of 2.5 billion tweets collected in mid-2020, finds that the beats of politics, international affairs, and technology see the highest relative number of journalists on Twitter.

We exploit a dataset
combining Gallup World Polls and Global Findex surveys for some 250,000 individuals in 140 countries, merging them with information on the incidence of epidemics and local 3G internet infrastructure. Epidemic exposure is associated with an increase in remote-access (online/mobile) banking and substitution from bank branch-based to ATM-based activity. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we show that heterogeneity in this response centers on the age, income and employment of respondents. Young, high-income earners in full-time employment have the greatest propensity to shift to online/mobile transactions in response to epidemics.

Those who rely on informal and local news sources have the largest knowledge gaps about these topics, while those who seek information from national or international news outlets and politicians have the most accurate knowledge. Race and class influence knowledge of government operations, public health, and science of COVID-19.

Central to this debate is a binary that constructs police officers as fulfilling either a protective, community-serving role, or an aggressive, crime-fighting role. The most recent iteration of this binary is reflected in the warrior-guardian construct, which conceptualizes officers as both initiators of, and defenders against, violence. In this article, I examine how the warrior-guardian framework shapes police training and highlight the way in which this construct is itself gendered and racialized. I draw on one year of ethnographic field work at four police academies and 41 interviews with police officers and cadets to argue that police training is an organized effort to condition officers to conceptualize their relationship with the public as a war. I outline three components that constitute this framing: (1) instructors construct an evil, unpredictable enemy; (2) cadets are taught to identify their enemy in gendered and racialized ways; and (3) cadets are encouraged to adopt a warrior mentality. Ultimately, I show that cadets are taught to view the world in a way that pits them against an enemy, conceptualize their enemy as a man of color, and think about violence as a moral necessity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-30T20:48:42.050090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-30T20:48:07.999880,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/citation/,me4cv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60dcab25ef8b3f01e6bdfd52/,60dcab25ef8b3f01e6bdfd52,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/me4cv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/me4cv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/me4cv

Accessibility, or the ease of reaching opportunities, has become very popular and widely used for this purpose. But commonly used accessibility measures also embody weaknesses that are seldom acknowledged; these limit their utility for truly understanding the benefits of transit investments. In this paper, we identify the pros and cons of these competing approaches and offer a third strategy.

Though a globally widespread phenomenon, extant literature has generated theoretical expectations and empirical findings mostly inspired by the United States and Western Europe. By studying the case of Brazil, I argue and show that traditional explanations do not provide satisfactory accounts of affective polarisation in contexts where politics is only weakly structured by ideology or partisan attachments. I argue and show that in such contexts the concept of negative political identities can provide a much better explanation for why politics is so divisive. Using both the 2014 and 2018 waves of the Brazilian Electoral Studies (BES) and independently collected survey data (N = 1,732), I provide robust empirical findings supporting the primacy of negative political identities over traditional hypotheses. Negative identification with the out-party/leader has a strong effect on dislike towards out-voters even when controlling for instrumental evaluations of political elites. This paper contributes to the comparative research agenda on affective polarisation outside Western contexts, as well as to the the study of negative political identities.",TRUE,FALSE,affective polarisation|affective polarization|antibolsonarismo|antipetismo|brazilian politics|negational identity|negative partisanship|political identities,2021-06-30T20:50:03.855893,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-30T20:48:48.613947,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/citation/,hswtz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60dc88fbf83de201e4afdfad/,60dc88fbf83de201e4afdfad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswtz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hswtz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hswtz

This chapter provides an overview of demographic theory, focusing specifically on relationships between population size, population growth, and welfare. It then discusses four implications of demographic theory for population ethics. Speaking broadly, these four implications concern (1) the overreliance by some population ethicists on Malthusian assumptions about the average welfare of population declining with increasing population size, (2) the likelihood of certain hypothetical scenarios that feature in thought experiments used in population ethics, (3) the prioritization of extinction risks by population ethicists, and (4) the patterns of intergenerational and intertemporal inequality that population ethicists may anticipate over the long run. The chapter closes with a discussion of demographic theory in relation to historical and future demographic change.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-30T20:51:21.890683,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-30T20:49:09.021001,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/citation/,at5pj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf992258510b0009a5a9a6/,60bf992258510b0009a5a9a6,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60dc831bef8b3f01e7bde7e8/,60dc831bef8b3f01e7bde7e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/at5pj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/at5pj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/at5pj
