We respond to the critiques of ecological fallacies and lack of control for prior achievement in school compositional research. We describe how prior ability control variables and fixed-effects methods have been inappropriately applied in research critical of compositional effects. We demonstrate that structural equation modeling can address concerns about the inflation of level-2 effects due to level-1 measurement error whilst also finding significant socio-economic school compositional effects. We conclude that the veracity of school socio-economic composition effects has not been weakened by recent critical studies and remain a profound issue for researchers and policymakers.,TRUE,FALSE,aggregation error|doubly latent methodology|ecological fallacy|measurement error|school composition|school seggregation|socio-economic composition,2018-12-13T09:37:40.885227,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-13T09:37:19.291512,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d71|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d75|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision|Elementary and Middle and Secondary Education Administration",Michael G.

I propose an unusual window of evidence --- modern societies. I hypothesize that evidence for the origin of inequality is  encoded in the institutional structure of industrial societies.  To test this idea, I use a model to project modern trends into the past. This model takes the modern relation between energy, hierarchy, and inequality and creates a hindcast of the origin of inequality.  The results are broadly consistent with the available evidence. The model predicts an explosion of inequality with the transition from hunter-gathering to agriculture, followed by a plateau.

A Bayesian latent variable model is employed to identify prominence and influence scores for a set of 45,000 U.S. politicians. Several validation exercises corroborate the superiority of the measures over existing alternatives. To illustrate their usefulness, I present an analysis of media appearances of political elites.

We build on this literature by examining publics’ perceptions of nations and development in internet search data, which we argue offers additional insights into publics’ perceptions that survey data does not address. Our analysis finds that developmental idealism is prevalent in international internet searches about countries. A consistent mental image of national development emerges from the traits publics ascribe to countries in internet searches. We find a positive relationship between the sentiment expressed in Google searches about a given country and its position in the global developmental hierarchy. Diverse publics consistently associate positive attributes to countries ranked high on global development indices and negative characteristics to countries ranked low. We also find a positive correlation between the number of internet searches about a country and the country’s position in indices of global development.

Based on in-depth interviews with 16 surgeons, drawn from qualitative research, this study reveals that surgeons subjectively construct the idea of incompetency through their understanding of the perceived circumstantial characteristics of the patients and family members. The findings largely suggest that surgeons dismiss their capacity based on constructed assessments, which leads to paternalistic practice. The findings  illustrate how these assessments structure the surgeons’ practices and provide the moral and practical justifications for their actions. The constructed knowledge becomes a source for drawing normative justification for surgeons’ actions and, in conjunction with socially enforced relationships, leads patients and family members to be on the receiving end of disrespectful attitudes. By  employing the ethical framework, this paper argues for physicians to pursue “respect for persons,” beyond the framework of “capacity/autonomy,” and to practice respect in hospital settings.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-11T14:12:21.909291,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-11T14:11:54.975812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/citation/,nhdrv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/auxz2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/relationships/node/,auxz2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0f593d9cdb9f00186611a8/,5c0f593d9cdb9f00186611a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nhdrv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nhdrv

Young adults of Generation Y are found to drive less and, in some contexts, are found to exhibit more multimodal travel patterns and to use public transit more often. Potential causes for these observed shifts in transport mode use have also been theorised: One view is that period effects in the form of contemporaneous changes in socio-cultural, socio-economic and socio-technical factors are responsible for the observed shifts in transport mode use; another view is that members of Generation Y have inherently different preferences and values due to formative socio-cultural, socio-economic and historical experiences. Motivated by this yet-to-be-resolved dialectic, this paper uses a hierarchical Bayesian multivariate Poisson log-normal model to examine intergenerational differences in transport mode use among young adults. The model is applied to 23 waves of the German Mobility Panel and captures between-cohort and between-period variation of parameters of interest. The trained model informs a counterfactual prediction exercise aiming to decompose intergenerational differences in transport mode use into demography-, cohort-, and period-specific effects. Our findings suggest that all three sets of effects account for intergenerational differences in transport mode use, while the absolute and relative importance of each set of effects vary across transport modes. For the period from 1998 to 2016, two thirds of the decline in car use can be ascribed to period effects; nearly all of the increase in public transit use and 42% of the increase in bicycling can be ascribed to cohort effects.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-11T02:39:02.176135,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-11T02:38:41.015574,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Rico Krueger 2018,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/citation/,unezy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rhqgv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/relationships/node/,rhqgv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0f1fe19cdb9f001966693c/,5c0f1fe19cdb9f001966693c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/unezy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/unezy

presidents could guarantee their influence over Supreme Courts’ 
decisions provided that presidents nominate at least half of the
bench. I argue, however, that this is not always the case, as 
in some courts, individual justices have primacy over the collective
body. I develop a model that states that the control of the agenda 
power by individual justices is a determinant factor for understanding
judicial independence. The Brazilian Supreme Court serves as a good
case, as there are several institutional rules that allow each 
justice to pause or change the result of a judgment, without consulting
his or her peers. My research design focuses on three cases studies of
the court and 3,043 decisions, which I analyze using matching. Results show
that, when the government has a strong interest in a particular 
lawsuit, the probability of this lawsuit being halted by a Supreme
Court justice is higher. The fact that presidents can influence
individual justices, and in turn these justices can affect the
course of a lawsuit, sheds new light on the role that judicial 
independence has when considering presidents’ influence over Supreme Court decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazilian Supreme Court|Judicial Independence|Judicial Politics,2018-12-11T00:33:26.493450,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-11T00:33:00.774009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/citation/,by3sw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7mwrv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/relationships/node/,7mwrv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0e59049cdb9f0016679950/,5c0e59049cdb9f0016679950,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/by3sw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/by3sw
