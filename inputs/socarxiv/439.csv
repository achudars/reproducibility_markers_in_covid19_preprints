Yet it is among the least researched topics in police science. Other types of investigations are performed using the same overall methodology, but within different jurisdictions and with different objectives. Experience suggests that there is room for trans-organisational and inter-subject learning between various organisations performing investigations, and the miscellaneous fields of investigation and forensics. This document describes a preliminary investigation process model designed to be applicable in all situations where a systematic examination or study is performed. The model is based on previous work by contemporary scholars and shares similarities with Fahsing’s ”6 Cs” circular model. Descriptive Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) is used to visualise the process. The objectives are to express, detail and visualise the various investigation actions and the relationship between them, thus contributing to a greater understanding of the investigation process. The model also provides a framework on which further research can be conducted in this multi-disciplinary field.",TRUE,FALSE,Crime|Forensics|Investigation|Process model,2019-05-28T13:56:05.806916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-28T13:49:09.559618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0d|Law|Criminal Procedure|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c72|Law|Civil Procedure|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Forensic Science and Technology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/citation/,z4wma,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced381f23fec40018e77085/,5ced381f23fec40018e77085,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z4wma/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z4wma,NA

ICT with children. However, as they are found to have had no or only a little training or practical 
experience of pedagogical use of ICT, it is important to explore where the positive attitude comes 
from, and what pedagogical benefits early childhood educators believe ICT use brings about. This 
study focuses on the relationships of educators’ general and ICT-related pedagogical beliefs, and the 
foundations of educators’ positive ICT pedagogical beliefs.   
In their general pedagogical beliefs, the educators emphasized the learning of socio-emotional skills, 
and reported that they carry out practices where children have an active role in their learning. In their 
ICT pedagogical beliefs, the educators emphasized the learning of academic skills, and the methods 
they described were usually individual exercises which were either carried out using ICT or by 
following educators’ ICT-supported instructions. Positive ICT pedagogical beliefs were, to a large 
extent, based on perceptions of what different devices and software promise in terms of children’s 
learning. Outside influences, i.e., the model observed from primary school, also played a significant 
role in the construction of the educators’ ICT pedagogical beliefs.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-28T14:24:42.800138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-28T14:24:14.635459,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/citation/,a6cfy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cecf05d2a50c40019805a93/,5cecf05d2a50c40019805a93,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6cfy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6cfy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6cfy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.037

I start by focusing on how the Mengen organise their horticulture in time by following the cycles of particular trees thus dividing the year into several seasons during which different gardening tasks are done. This is a concrete example of the temporality of the Mengen landscape. It shows how ecological temporalities, such as the growth of certain trees and food plants, intersect or converge with human temporal trajectories. Following that, I show how people not only coordinate their activities by observing a temporal landscape, but through their gardening activities they also create it.

In this project, we wanted to assign OA tags to publications in KB database. We queried KB in-house database up to 2017 (including Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus) for all articles and reviews. We then matched the corresponding DOIs to three sources of OA information: Unpaywall, Crossref and Bielefeld list of gold OA journals. This allowed us to define the OA status for publications. We found close to 14 million publications (articles and reviews between 2000 and 2016) from WOS (69.75% of all) and close to 18 million from Scopus (68.67% of all) with an equivalent DOI in Unpaywall. We matched KB publications database with Crossref data (from April 2018) and found 53 distinct licence URLs, which define in many cases the legally binding access status of publications. We found that more than half a million publications have more than one licence record in Crossref (in contrast to near 8 million with only one record and more than 6 million without a licence URL). We evaluated if these licences were open or closed access. We also matched respective journal ISSNs with DOAJ and ROAD databases and presented a categorization of publications to Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and Delayed OA accounting for uncertainty due to missing licence information via a new sub-category Probable Hybrid OA. We validate our findings via manual checks and a crosscheck of OA information from the aforementioned varying sources.

Mapping the third space of ICT integration in early childhood education,"The current stage of early years information and communication technology (ICT) integration research has been criticized for not paying enough attention to the unique pedagogical features of early childhood education. Similarly, children’s views about educational use of ICT have been underrepresented in research. This dissertation study contributes to resolving these gaps in the literature by exploring children’s ideas and preservice teachers’ beliefs regarding the role of ICT in early childhood education.

The study consists of two data sets that are reported in three empirical articles. The first study focused on children’s ideas and their contextual roots. The second study explored preservice teachers’ beliefs about children and ICT at home. The third study investigated preservice teachers’ perceptions of ICT integration through the frames of teaching, education, and care, referred to as the EDUCARE approach. In this compilation, the findings of the empirical studies are scrutinized through the analytical device of third space theory.

The findings suggest that there is a dissonance between the meanings children and preservice teachers give to ICT use. Children conceptualized ICT use as a leisure activity whereas preservice teachers approached ICT mainly through learning. The findings also imply that although EDUCARE has been described as a holistic framework in the context of ICT integration, the framework acts as a disintegrating vehicle: When ICT integration was approached from the perspective of teaching, the views were mainly positive. When the perspective was changed to care, the views were profoundly negative. Care-related concerns were associated with preservice teachers’ beliefs about children’s use of ICT at home being extensive and unregulated. Another exaggerated belief was considering children born-competent ICT users.

The results of this study have several implications for early childhood education, as well as preservice teacher education. To make ICT pedagogy truly meaningful for children, ICT should be approached as a cultural form, and space should be given for children’s views, values, and experiences. Additionally, educational technology courses need to pay more attention to aspects of care, as well as to preservice teachers’ often unrealistic beliefs about children and technology.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital media|early childhood education|educational technology|technology integration|Third space,2019-05-27T12:49:42.277983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-27T12:49:20.299173,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/citation/,tf4rk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cea6c122a50c4001781b5df/,5cea6c122a50c4001781b5df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tf4rk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tf4rk,NA

The role of feelings in the persistence of marriage as an institution,"Despite cohabitation becoming increasingly equivalent to marriage in some of the most ‘advanced’ Western European societies, the vast majority of people still marry. Why so? Existing theories, mostly based on various approaches tied to cognitive decision‐making, do not provide a sufficient explanation of the persistence of marriage. In this article, we argue that feelings attached to marriage, i.e. the affective evaluation of those involved in a partner relationship concerning marriage as opposed to cohabitation, explain the persistent importance of marriage as an institution.

We examine the implicative role of evolution in determining the course of social changes and the plunges it eventually take. The fact that the cognitive processes, contradiction, giving vent to evolutionary proceed, and conflict and continuity, are allied to evolution, is emphasized.

By inviting women to share their ordinarily silenced stories, the hashtag #MeToo surfaced a network of survivors to confront this stigma. Through a mixed-methods analysis of over 1.5 million tweets posted during the first two weeks after #MeToo gained widespread popularity in 2017, we map the landscape of disclosures that emerged and disentangle the effects of network-level reciprocal disclosures, or disclosures made in reaction to seeing others disclose. We detail how survivors disclosed a diversity of sexual violence experiences in solidarity with others, composing nearly half of all authored tweets and comprising a disproportionate number of interactions within the #MeToo network. Further, we show that the more disclosures an individual potentially saw prior to disclosing, the more likely they were to share details with their disclosure. We argue that such network-level reciprocal disclosures may have reduced stigma, creating a counterpublic space safe for disclosure which, subsequently, generated more disclosures. Our work illustrates how feminist hashtag activism, like #MeToo, can unify individual and collective narratives to dismantle the stigma surrounding disclosures of sexual violence.
