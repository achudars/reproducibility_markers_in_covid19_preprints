NSMIA is one of a number of factors that have changed the going-public versus staying-private trade-off, helping bring about a new equilibrium where fewer startups go public, and those that do are older.

Despite their positive impact on economic welfare, concerns are raised about the negative association between social media usage and performance or well-being. However, causal empirical evidence is still scarce. To address this research gap, we conduct a randomized controlled trial among students in which we track participants’ digital activities over the course of three quarters of an academic year. In the experiment, we randomly allocate half of the sample to a treatment condition in which social media usage is restricted to a maximum of 10 minutes per day. We find that participants in the treatment group substitute social media for instant messaging and do not decrease their total time spent on digital devices. Contrary to findings from previous correlational studies, we do not find any impact of social media usage on well-being and academic success.

Using empirical data on social, economic and criminal conditions of the area under analysis, we use a multi-layer network approach to simulate this scenario.

On attitudes towards the use of big data algorithms for law enforcement,"The use of predictive AI tools to improve decision-making in relation to crime prevention and investigation is a reality. They are being implemented almost before we fully understand how they work, while we make relevant legal decisions that may determine the progress of the technology, and long before we can predict their full impact. This paper addresses the attitudes towards this technological revolution applied to criminal justice, focusing in particular on its use by police. The first section summarises and describes the techniques and technologies that make up predictive policing. Subsequently, the main part of the study analyses the attitudes with which this technology has been received. These range from the optimism of those who defend its immediate implementation as a way to improve police objectivity and efficiency, to the pessimism of those who see its use as strengthening a dystopia of state control and surveillance. Two apparent extremes that correspond to the transition from optimism to technological pessimism of the twentieth century. The article concludes with a defence of a realistic, critical and informed view of the use of these predictive algorithms. A vision that, on the one hand, accepts that there are no neutral technologies, yet does not fall into fatalism and technophobia; and, on the other hand, places the human being and the legitimate police function at the centre of the algorithmic equation while redefining its objectives based on the scientific evidence applied to each individual technology.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithms|big data|criminal justice system|predictive policing,2020-01-13T18:01:42.460402,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-13T18:01:21.321590,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/citation/,a7juk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1c7bb26822bd00b4feddcb/,5e1c7bb26822bd00b4feddcb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a7juk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a7juk,NA

Evidence from the U.S. States, 2000-2015","Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The rise in suicide rates is contributing to the recently observed decline in life expectancy. While previous research identified a solid association between economic strain and suicide, little attention has been paid to how specific welfare policies that are designed to alleviate economic strain may influence suicide rates. There is a growing body of research that is using an institutional approach to demonstrate the role of welfare-state policies in the distribution of health. However, this perspective has not been applied yet to the investigation of suicide. In this study, I combine these approaches to analyze the association between two specific policies, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and overall and gender-specific suicide rates across the 50 U.S. states between 2000 and 2015. I estimate two-way fixed-effects longitudinal models and find evidence of a robust association between one of these policies – SNAP – and overall and male suicide. After adjusting for a number of confounding factors, higher participation in SNAP is associated with lower overall and male suicide rates. Increasing SNAP participation by one standard deviation (4.5% of the state population) during the study period could have saved the lives of approximately 31,600 people overall and 24,800 men.",TRUE,FALSE,Fixed-Effects|Food Stamps|Health|Panel Data|Social Determinants|Social Policy|Suicide,2020-01-13T01:29:41.779143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-13T01:29:15.932221,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/citation/,pnr5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/54hfv/,54hfv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1b9f916822bd0070ff2104/,5e1b9f916822bd0070ff2104,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pnr5x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pnr5x,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112778

This prediction was based on a computational model that quantified in the USA such structural-demographic forces for instability as popular immiseration, intraelite competition, and state weakness prior to 2010. Using these trends as inputs, the model calculated and projected forward in time the Political Stress Index, which in the past was strongly correlated with socio-political instability. Ortmans et al. (2017) conducted a similar structural-demographic study for the United Kingdom and obtained similar results. Here we use the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive for the US, UK, and Western European countries to assess these structural-demographic predictions.

To examine the co-occurrence of mental health (depression, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, suicide ideation) and substance use outcomes among female, male, and transgender–gender nonbinary (TNB) college students exposed to sexual assault (SA).

Methods. Data were drawn from a 2018 U.S. national survey of college student wellbeing (N = 50,438). Inverse propensity-weighted three-step latent class analysis was used to examine co-occurrence of outcomes while adjusting for 31 potential confounders of the relation between SA exposure and outcomes.

Results. Four latent classes were identified for female and male participants, and two for TNB participants, reflecting a range from low to high outcome risk. Exposure to SA was associated with significantly and substantially increased odds (ORs: 2.03–3.64) of membership to the highest-risk outcome class compared to the lowest risk class.

Conclusions.

This article synthesizes existing approaches to conceptualizing legitimacy across the social sciences to identify widely agreed upon definitional properties, and builds on these points of consensus to develop a generalizable approach to operationalization. Legitimacy implies specific relationships among three empirical elements: an object of legitimacy, an audience that confers legitimacy, and a relationship between the two. Together, these empirical elements constitute a dyad (i.e., a single unit consisting of two nodes and a tie). I identify three necessary conditions for legitimacy—expectations, assent, and conformity—that specify how elements of the dyad interact. I detail how these conditions can be used to empirically establish legitimacy (and illegitimacy), distinguishing it from dissimilar phenomena that may appear similar in their empirical manifestations. I elaborate the advantages of approaching the measurement of legitimacy in this way. Followed to its logical conclusion, this operationalization has important implications for understanding the effects of legitimacy. I discuss these implications, and how they inform debates over the relevance of legitimacy for explaining socially significant outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,illegitimacy|legitimacy|networks|operationalization|relational sociology|theory,2020-01-11T21:01:22.849331,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-11T21:00:58.715816,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/citation/,q5tnd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e19b24b855d4c0042b70ded/,5e19b24b855d4c0042b70ded,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5tnd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q5tnd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q5tnd,NA

Class-Biased Economic Reporting in the United States,"There is substantial evidence that voters’ choices are shaped by assessments of the state of the economy and that these assessments, in turn, are influenced by the news. But how does the economic news track the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality? Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of U.S. news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households, with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further, we present evidence that this “class bias” emerges not from pro-rich journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the media’s focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the relationship between economic growth and distribution. The findings yield a novel explanation of distributionally perverse electoral patterns and demonstrate how the structure of the economy conditions economic accountability.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-11T20:55:04.018161,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-11T20:54:33.555816,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/citation/,mcdak,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/85cfr/,85cfr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e19173e855d4c002db7428d/,5e19173e855d4c002db7428d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcdak/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mcdak/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mcdak,NA
