The current paper examines victim impact and self-protective behaviours following victimization from different types of cyber abuse.

Our findings suggest that controlling for socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race and employment, different types of cyber abuse are important explanations of both victim impact and self-protective behaviours following cyber abuse victimization.

Movement of labour across North American borders changes the membership of cooperatives as well as the leadership and formation of cooperatives.  The socio-economic shifts that affect cooperatives are also accompanied by marginalization of particular populations, including Indigenous communities and racial minorities. International cooperative principles remain ideals to aspire to rather than a reality in practice. Although women and racial minorities have made some advances in equity in cooperatives, racialized women in particular are not represented in leadership positions in cooperatives in proportion to membership in the broader population. On an optimistic note, cooperatives continue to be more egalitarian organizations than other types of organizations and therefore have the potential for leading as positive role models, addressing the intersection of gender and race for other organizations to follow.  Women leading cooperatives will form different types of cooperatives than men leading cooperatives in the same industry.  Additionally women of colour leading cooperatives will form different types of organizations than traditional cooperatives, providing for enriched plurality of organizational forms required for addressing complex socio-economic problems.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|Cooperatives|Culture|El Salvador|Ethnicity|Gender|Guatemala|Immigrant|Indigenous|Mexico|Neoliberalism|Nicaraguua|Organizational Behavior|Race|United States|Women,2019-09-05T15:35:23.375313,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-05T15:34:55.831679,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Journal of Co-operative Studies,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/citation/,hbj9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7089e95a289c001c4a6ba6/,5d7089e95a289c001c4a6ba6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hbj9k/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hbj9k

This paper argues that, because of the tariff’s role in the societal decision making process, it should not be understood as merely a statistical model, but as a major instrument of democratic participation.

This manuscript incorporates two important, though ignored features in past research by inves- tigating how time shapes the properties of belief networks for different populations of people – those who exhibit high and low levels of political knowledge. Subsequent analysis produces several findings: (1) belief network density increases asymmetrically among people with high relative to low knowledge; (2) symbolic preferences are always more central to belief networks irrespective of survey timing or popula- tion; in contrast, policy beliefs exhibit some increase in centrality over time among the politically knowl- edgeable; and, (3) centrality does not predict variance within standard parametric models. This latter finding, in particular, presents problems for describing belief networks using the vernacular of Conversian belief systems – a disconnect that seems grounded in the mismatch between Converse’s individual-level theory and network analysis’ population-based properties.",TRUE,FALSE,ANES|belief networks|centrality|ideology|panel data|political psychology,2019-09-05T15:32:02.174668,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-05T15:31:47.450804,NA,NA,available,NA,https://electionstudies.org/data-center/,no,(no preregistration),,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/citation/,6r3ym,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qhaxb/,qhaxb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7030c45a289c00194a8a3b/,5d7030c45a289c00194a8a3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r3ym/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6r3ym/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6r3ym

They work to create favorable conditions to market their services. At the same time, they are constrained by external political forces, including political parties, social movements, and public opinion. This article reviews what we know about the reciprocal relationship between the private corrections industry and politics. 
Policy Implications: The review of extant research yields several implications for practitioners and policymakers. First, correctional privatization is not uniformly accepted, a fact that presents challenges for the industry and opportunities for critics. Second, punitive policies that appear beneficial to industry (particularly, those related to tough immigration policy) may in fact pose real reputational risks. Third, new forms of privatization—namely, social impact bonds—may prove more tolerable to the general public. Finally, consideration of political activity by private industry should not distract from political activity by public sector actors (e.g., prison guard unions).",TRUE,FALSE,immigration|politics|private prisons|privatization|public policy,2019-09-04T19:53:22.343126,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T19:52:58.988131,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/citation/,dfex5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wzrpq/,wzrpq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7009ea7215100019a2cd2b/,5d7009ea7215100019a2cd2b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfex5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dfex5/,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12431,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dfex5

This article analyses the peacebuilding implications of a ‘burning plasma’ fusion breakthrough, with its enormous implications for both worsening conflicts and for peacebuilding. To do so, we apply the nonkilling global political science peacebuilding conceptual framework; the quintuple helix technology innovation ecosystem model, emphasizing the role of civil society and socioecology; and recent path dependence theory. The first burning plasma will be a nearly unprecedented historical event. The closest parallel is the Trinity Test, which heralded the Atomic Age, the implications of which for perpetuating conflict and potentially for peacebuilding were keenly understood; we analyse the Test in path dependence terms for the first time to compare it with fusion. As with fission power, fusion will be weaponized due to its intrinsic benefits. However, the innovations leading to the burning plasma are not occurring in a vacuum. Unlike Trinity, which was conducted in secret in wartime without civilian or media contributions, fusion is being developed in peacetime in the public eye, and in the context of a low-carbon transition. With fission, immediately following the Second World War, despite initial progress, the USSR rejected the US Baruch Plan to put atomic energy and weapons under the UN to stifle a nuclear arms race, due to an insufficient political imperative to cooperate. The result was the Cold War. As such, we forecast a global critical juncture in which a new normative nuclear order can be created via a ‘new Baruch Plan’, with governments, the private sector, the International Energy Agency, the IAEA, and civil society accelerating the development and commercialization of fusion power. Moreover, if the world does finally enjoy ‘energy for all’, the expected decrease in interstate conflict opens up the possibility of a Universal Global Peace Treaty, with humanity re-prioritising its goals for this century.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|global nonkilling political science|nuclear fusion|peace building|quintuple helix innovation ecosystem|railgun,2019-09-04T19:54:26.816956,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T19:54:01.369072,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/citation/,mrzua,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n6p7x/,n6p7x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ff05b536cf5001a8e67d6/,5d6ff05b536cf5001a8e67d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrzua/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrzua
