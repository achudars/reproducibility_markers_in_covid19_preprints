will be used to exclude competitors, only a tiny fraction of patents are
ever enforced. Legal and economic scholars have theorized as to how to
identify valuable patents based on their individual characteristics. In
this paper, we present the results of the largest empirical study ever
conducted of the patent system. We compare the characteristics of litigated
patents to those of issued patents generally, and we find important
differences in a range of dimensions. These data confirm some predictions
in the literature regarding patent value and refute others. New patents are
more likely to be litigated than old patents. Foreign patent owners are
less likely to litigate than domestic patent owners. Patents that issue to
individuals or small companies are much more likely to be litigated than
those that issue to big companies, though many of those patents have
changed hands by the time they are brought to court. Patents that cite more
prior art are more likely to be litigated, and those that are litigated
tend to be cited more elsewhere. Most significantly, there are substantial
differences between industries in the likelihood of patent litigation.
Patents in the mechanical, computer, and medical device industries are
significantly more likely to be litigated, for example, than patents in the
chemical and semiconductor industries.

In the paper, we explore the implications of these findings in detail.
Taken together, the data give a profile of a few valuable patents that
stand out from a field of ordinary ones. They are the patents that their
owners spend the most time and money in prosecuting. They are the ones that
competitors recognize as most important. They are concentrated in a few
industries in which patents play a more significant role in encouraging
innovation. And they are patents that issue to individuals or small
companies with asymmetric stakes in patent litigation, not to large
companies. These conclusions in turn have significant implications for the
design of the patent system, patent reform efforts and patent valuation
theories - implications we consider at the end of the paper.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:27.276585,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:08:04.663000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/citation/,c8szj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f3d8j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/relationships/node/,f3d8j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc82f69ad5a101fb68d3fd/,57bc82f69ad5a101fb68d3fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c8szj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c8szj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c8szj

a form of property, and have applied the economic insights of Harold
Demsetz and other property theorists to condemn the use of intellectual
property by others as ""free riding."" In this article, I argue that this
represents a fundamental misapplication of the economic theory of property.
The economics of property is concerned with internalizing negative
externalities - harms that one person's use of land does to another's
interest to it, as in the familiar tragedy of the commons. But the
externalities in intellectual property are positive, not negative, and
property theory offers little or no justification for internalizing
positive externalities. Indeed, doing so is at odds with the logic and
functioning of the market. From this core insight, I proceed to explain why
free riding is desirable in intellectual property cases except in limited
circumstances where curbing it is necessary to encourage creativity. I
explain why economic theory demonstrates that too much protection is just
as bad as not enough protection, and therefore why intellectual property
law must search for balance, not free riders. Finally, I consider whether
we would be better served by another metaphor than the misused notion of
intellectual property as a form of tangible property.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:11.343237,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:05:05.794000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/citation/,3bdp6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vs6mb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/relationships/node/,vs6mb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc8243b83f6901f6655e23/,57bc8243b83f6901f6655e23,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bdp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3bdp6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3bdp6

We propose the following solution to this important cultural evolution question: Illness or injury often leaves people incapacitated for long periods. Caregiving - the provision of food, shelter etc. - is an important medical practice that enables ill or injured people and their dependents to survive these periods. However, caregiving is vulnerable to exploitation via illness deception whereby people feign illness in order to gain access to care. Harmful treatments helped to solve the problem of illness deception because only individuals who stand to gain substantially from care will accept the treatment. To investigate the plausibility of this theory we develop a mathematical model using evolutionary game theory and invasion analysis. We show that decreasing the benefit of caregiving via aversive and unpleasant medical treatments can counter-intuitively increase the range of conditions where caregiving is evolutionarily viable. Thus poisoning, cannibalism, emetics, bloodletting and other such treatments may be solutions to the problem of allocation of resources to people with unclear need.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:31.407641,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T10:02:44.369000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Preprint,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/citation/,7d8zk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mxyts/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/relationships/node/,mxyts,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e673eb594d9001f39192e0/,57e673eb594d9001f39192e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8zk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7d8zk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7d8zk

outcomes of medical treatment. The objective to test the following
explanation: People who have a positive outcome tend to tell more people
about their disease/treatment than people with poor or average outcomes.
Akin to the file drawer problem in science, this systematically and
positively distorts the information available to others. *Design. *A
comparison of average health outcomes in clinical trials with average
outcomes in online health product reviews. *Methods*. If people with good
outcomes are more inclined to tell other people, then they should also be
more inclined to write online medical product reviews. Therefore average
outcomes in these reviews should be more positive than those found in RCTs.
Data on duration of treatment and outcome (weight or cholesterol change)
was extracted from user-generated health product reviews on Amazon.com and
compared to RCT data for the same treatments using ANOVA. The sample included
1,675 reviews of cholesterol reduction (Benecol, CholestOff) and weight
loss (Orlistat) treatments and the primary outcomes were Cholesterol change
(Bencol and CholestOff) or weight change (Orlistat). *Results*. In three
independent tests, average outcomes reported in reviews were substantially
more positive that outcomes reported in the medical literature (η2:  .01 to
.06; p: .04 to .001). For example, average cholesterol change following use
of Benecol is - 14mg/dl in RCTs and -45mg/dl in online reviews.
