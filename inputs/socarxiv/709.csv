Plotinus believed that the teachings of Gnostics were horrible because hey apparently followed the teachings of Plato and had some compatible views on the origin and nature of the cosmos with Platonism, but ""Gnostic myth"" actually twisted Plato's original teachings, and ultimately turned against him. Neoplatonists had a generally cheerful and optimistic view of the world as opposed to the Gnostics who despised it. Evil does not exist, it is just a ""lack or deficit of Goodness"" according to Neoplatonism. The only source of evil for Neoplatonists is being in the state of distance from the One, as a result of turning to the excessive material pleasures downwards and not toward superior spiritual reality upwards. Augustine became Neoplatonist in indirect way, and we know that Neoplatonistic texts helped in his transition to Christianity. He used the Platonic writings to attack Manichaeism, a sect which he once belonged. He came across Neoplatonic works of Plotinus and Ambrose written in Latin that helped him to change his Manichaean way of thinking about good and evil. Augustine said that Manichaean God is not true God because He is vulnerable to evil, stating that a true God is omnipotent and can't be affected in any way. After Augustine encountered  Neoplatonic teachings he called Manichean teachings extremely simplified, pointing out that people are not found in every life situation torn between just two alternatives: good and evil, since people have multiple, complex and complicated desires and needs. According to Augustine we do not have two substances in us that are in war with each other, light and darkness, good and evil, but the problem is in our will that longs for a multitude of things that we want, of which only some are good. In this way he formulated his doctrine of good and evil influenced by  Neoplatonism which was completely different from the dualistic approach we find in Gnosticim and Manichaeism.",TRUE,FALSE,dualism|Gnosticism|Good and Evil|Goodness|Manichaeism|Neoplatonism|Plotinus|st.Augustine,2018-07-02T10:58:06.900952,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-13T06:33:10.573392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/citation/,krj2n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c37js/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/relationships/node/,c37js,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5916a761b83f69024c1aa66c/,5916a761b83f69024c1aa66c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/krj2n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/krj2n,NA

I present a general analytic and measurement framework useful for rethinking traditional survey (or population) based data on individuals and their cultural choices as a “two mode” persons X genres network. The proposed methodological tools allow me to develop a set of “reflective” metrics useful for ranking both persons and genres in terms of the pattern of choices and audience composition embedded in the cultural network.

This frequent geographical disruption directly affects the career trajectories of military spouses. Previous research established military spouses experience worse employment outcomes than their civilian peers, but less is known about the specific characteristics that lead to this difference. Do military spouses have worse employment outcomes because of being a tied migrant, or is there a separate effect because of their status as a military spouse? 

This article analyzes original data from a factorial vignette survey in which respondents evaluated fictitious job applicant profiles. Results suggest (1) Military spouses receive a premium as job applicants, they are evaluated as more warm, competent, reliable, and social, but receive lower evaluations on perceived longevity; (2) Military spouses with a stable geographic history are evaluated higher than civilians, but that premium switches to a penalty for military spouses with a history of moving frequently, in which case they are evaluated more harshly than civilians who have moved frequently; and (3) Neither tied migration nor military spouse status influence starting salary offers. As many careers require employees to move as part of their training or to seek advancement opportunities, understanding the employment-related challenges and opportunities military spouses face can lead to implications that may affect other tied migrants.",TRUE,FALSE,employment|military|military spouse|tied migration|work,2018-07-02T10:58:06.627638,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-12T16:53:02.574774,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/citation/,j5xn9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xu6dy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/relationships/node/,xu6dy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5915e8066c613b024cf7198a/,5915e8066c613b024cf7198a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j5xn9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j5xn9,NA

A key challenge for social ventures is resource acquisition. However, how social entrepreneurs gather the resources necessary to grow their organizations is not clear. The focus of this study is how narratives are used to acquire social venture resources. This topic is examined using a multi-study, inductive, theory-building design based on 121 interviews, observation, and archival data. In Study 1, I interview 75 entrepreneurs, investors, and ancillary participants in the social enterprise sector. In Study 2, I construct case studies of eight technology-focused social ventures. Evidence from this study is used to construct a framework explaining how differences in entrepreneurs’ narrative tactics and characteristics are associated with differences in their resource acquisition success. Specifically, from Study 1 I develop a typology of social enterprise narratives, identify three narrative-types (personal, social-good, and business), and show that they possess unique elements. Evidence from Study 2 suggests that the three narrative-types serve as the building blocks for communication with external stakeholders. These findings contribute to three literatures that formed the basis of the study – social entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial resource acquisition, and organizational narrative theory – and have implications for work on competing organizational logics. They also produce several practical implications for social entrepreneurs.",TRUE,FALSE,entrepreneurship|narrative|qualitative methods|resource acquisition|social enterprise|social entrepreneurship|social innovation|storytelling,2018-07-02T10:58:06.519029,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-12T01:19:18.622876,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/citation/,7d8x4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hvepg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/relationships/node/,hvepg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59150c28594d90024d35b20a/,59150c28594d90024d35b20a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d8x4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7d8x4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7d8x4,NA

Yet, it is commonly practiced as a solitary endeavor and primary data is not often subject to scholarly scrutiny. In this paper, I suggest a model in which to understand the different ways in which ethnographies can be transparent—naming places, naming people, and sharing data—and the varied decisions ethnographers have made with regard to them: whether to name a region, city or specific neighborhood, name primary participants or public officials, and to share interview guides, transcripts, or different kinds of field notes.

This paper examines the types of stigmatizing language and frames present in news reports about persons with mental illness killed by police. A sample of 301 online news reports was content analyzed, of which 132 reports contributed to 231 examples of stigmatizing language or frames. Analysis indicates that the construction of stigma in these news reports does not fully adhere to existing frameworks for identifying stigmatization. Stigmatization that is implicit, and often seemingly innocuous, is almost three times as common in the analyzed news reports than overt and explicit forms of stigmatization. A modified framework for identifying stigmatization is proposed that includes the presence of stigmatizing syntax, implicit stereotypes, stigmatizing myths, and behavior labeling. To the author's knowledge, this study is the first to examine media stigmatization of persons with mental illness killed by police as well as explore stigmatization regarding suicide by cop. Implications of the findings for efforts to destigmatize mental illness are explored.
