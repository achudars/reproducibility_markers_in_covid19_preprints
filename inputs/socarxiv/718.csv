of some kind, highlighting the promise of gay-straight alliance groups by
comparing the experiences of students at schools with gay-straight
alliances (GSA schools) with the experiences of students at schools that
did not have an LGBTQ-specific group (no-GSA schools). We compare students
at GSA and no-GSA schools based on their experiences of harassment,
experiences of support from authority figures, and patterns of friendships.
We find that students at both types of schools experienced harassment and
heard negative comments about lesbian and gay people. However, students at
GSA schools reported more support from teachers and administrators than
students at no-GSA schools, who have stories of teachers and administrators
actively opposing equality for LGBTQ people. Students at GSA schools
reported a wide variety of friendships across sexual identities, while
students at no-GSA schools felt more isolated and withdrawn. This

clinical interactions are primarily driven by physicians’ perception of
relevance. These perceptions of relevance depend on the physician’s own
biographical background. While some physicians will perceive a connection
between religion and patient health, this relevance will be less apparent
for others. I argue here that physician responses when religious/spiritual
topics come up during clinical interactions will depend on their own
religious/spiritual background. The more central religion is for the
physician, as reflected by their religious/spiritual orientation, intrinsic
religiosity, and religious coping, the greater their perception of
religion’s impact on health outcomes and their inclusion of
religion/spirituality within clinical interactions. Using a nationally
representative sample of physicians in the U.S. and mediated path models, I
estimate models for five different physician actions to evaluate these
relationships. I find that a physician’s religious background is strongly
associated with whether or not they think religion impacts health outcomes,
which is strongly predictive of inclusion. I also find that not all of the
association between inclusion and physicians’ religious background is
mediated by thinking religion impacts health outcomes. Issues of religion’s
relevance for medicine are important to the degree that religious beliefs
are an important dimension of patients’ lives.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,clinical interactions|patient interactions|physician beliefs|Preprint|professional values|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:42.589138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-20T14:28:37.614000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/citation/,ufmz4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8eh2x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/relationships/node/,8eh2x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578f8a966c613b01eaa2ec60/,578f8a966c613b01eaa2ec60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufmz4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufmz4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufmz4

Some research on gender differences has argued that biology leads women to be innately more religious than men, but other research has highlighted the importance of avoiding universal claims and recognizing complexity. This brief note uses General Social Survey data to report gender differences in predicted religiosity by religious category across eight measures. In the United States, gender differences seem to be primarily a Christian phenomenon. While women reveal higher levels of religiosity across Christian groups, this trend does not extend to non-Christian groups. Furthermore, there is variation even among Christian groups, with women not revealing higher levels of religiosity for all measures. Nevertheless, there does seem to be a general trend for women to report daily prayer more often than men.

clearly authorized to make medical decisions for them. From a

question of who makes these decisions matters for children’s rights.
This paper reports the results of a survey of 132 stakeholders
representing all U.S. states, 17 qualitative interviews, and a review
of relevant laws and policies. The stakeholders and legal research
revealed that in sixteen states, common practice disagreed with the
written laws and policies about who should be making medical decisions
for youth in the foster care system. Most often, foster parents are
making medical decisions despite note having legal authority to do so,
and birth parents are rarely making decisions even when they are
legally allowed to do so. This paper proposes that following federal
law about promoting family reunification, birth parents should be in
charge of medical decision making for the first 12-24 months. After
that time, the foster parent, if one is available and has shown
commitment to the child, should become the medical decision maker.
Such a policy would promote birth parent involvement and family
reunification while acknowledging the need of young people in care for
decision makers who can make long-term commitments to their care.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:08.949570,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-20T03:30:27.141000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/citation/,ksauc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t4pw4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/relationships/node/,t4pw4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/582967239ad5a10202b74836/,582967239ad5a10202b74836,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksauc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ksauc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ksauc
