Turkish nationalism has long been an enigma for scholars interested in the formation of national identity. The nationalist movement that succeeded in crafting the Republic of Turkey relied upon rhetoric that defined the nation in explicitly secular, civic, and territorial terms. Though the earliest scholarship on Turkish nationalism supported this perspective, more recent research has pointed to Turkey's efforts to homogenize the new state as evidence of the importance of ethnicity, and particularly religion, in constructing Turkish national identity. Yet this marked mismatch between political rhetoric and politics on the ground is perplexing. If Turkey was meant to be a secular and civic state, why did Turkish nationalist policies place such a heavy emphasis on ethnic and religious purity? Moreover, why did religious identity become such a salient characteristic for determining membership in the national community and for defining national identity? This article draws upon historical research and social identity complexity theory to analyze this seeming dichotomy between religious and civic definitions of the Turkish nation. I argue that the subjective overlap between religious and civic ingroups during the late Ottoman Empire and efforts by nationalists to rally the populace through religious appeals explains the persistence of religious definitions of the nation despite the Turkish nationalist movement's civic rhetoric, and accounts for much of the Turkish state's religiously oriented policies and exclusionary practices toward religious minorities in its early decades.",TRUE,FALSE,Islam in Turkey|Minorities|Nationalism|Religion|Social Identity|Social Identity Complexity|Turkey,2018-07-02T10:55:08.480022,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-04T19:50:56.192708,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c89|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c8e|Arts and Humanities|Race, Ethnicity and Post-Colonial Studies|Ethnic Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c92|Arts and Humanities|European Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c98|Arts and Humanities|Near Eastern Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd7|Arts and Humanities|History|Islamic World and Near East History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd9|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Religion|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce0|Arts and Humanities|History|Social History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce3|Arts and Humanities|History|European History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Gregory Goalwin,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/citation/,gdj43,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pnc4k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/relationships/node/,pnc4k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e3f7ff9ad5a1022ff4a78e/,58e3f7ff9ad5a1022ff4a78e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdj43/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gdj43/,https://doi.org/10.1017/ssh.2018.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gdj43

In particular, attention is given to examining how representations of Farah were related to discourses on British multiculturalism. A brief discussion of recent rejections of multiculturalism is provided, with specific reference given to political and public calls for immigrants to assimilate with ‘British values’. By turning away from a dichotomous understanding of assimilation, this article suggests that processes of assimilation reflect a complicated coalescence of national inclusion and exclusion. That is, rather than simply highlighting how the national press serve to reproduce simple ‘us’ and ‘them’ binaries, this article draws upon Elias and Scotson’s established–outsider perspective in order to examine how the discursive construction of the ‘nation’ rests upon a dynamic process of identifying and managing ‘outsider’ individuals. As a result, while ‘outsider’ groups are frequently subjected to negative media portrayals, it is argued that Farah’s significance was underscored by discourses that sought to highlight his assimilated Britishness and through his promotion as a symbol of Britain’s achieved multiculturalism.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:55:08.028220,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-03T21:23:05.661204,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/citation/,xj2bm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t9nxb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/relationships/node/,t9nxb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e2bb2cb83f690047e304ca/,58e2bb2cb83f690047e304ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2bm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xj2bm/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443716635863,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xj2bm

In this comment, I identify two methodological issues in McClintock’s (2014) article on beauty exchange. First, McClintock’s difference models, which find no evidence of exchange, are poor measures of exchange that fail to account for important confounders and rely upon an overly narrow conceptualization of exchange. Second, McClintock codes her log-linear models to find a difference in the effect of men and women’s beauty in exchange rather than the total effect of women’s beauty, which is both statistically significant and substantively large.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|gender|marriage|model interpretation|status exchange,2018-07-02T10:46:26.407838,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-31T19:49:36.981000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,Aaron Gullickson,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/citation/,5ydxd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rcaxh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/relationships/node/,rcaxh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58deb1e6594d9001f49754a0/,58deb1e6594d9001f49754a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ydxd/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122417724001,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ydxd

From preservation infrastructure, to tools for acquiring digital and digitized content, to platforms that provide access, enhance content, and enable various modes for users to engage with and make use of content, much of the core work of libraries, archives and museums is entangled with software. As a result, cultural heritage organizations of all sizes are increasingly involved in roles as open source software creators, contributors, maintainers, and adopters. Participants in this workshop shared their respective perspectives on institutional roles in this emerging open source ecosystem. Through discussion, participants created drafts of a checklist for establishing FOSS projects, documentation of project sustainability techniques, a model for conceptualizing the role of open source community building activities throughout projects and an initial model for key institutional roles for projects at different levels of maturity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:53:46.594673,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-31T15:41:11.476000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/citation/,w4z4v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jqewd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/relationships/node/,jqewd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58de77abb83f6901ffee8ce0/,58de77abb83f6901ffee8ce0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4z4v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w4z4v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w4z4v

We test one possible explanation for why people are prone to conspiratorial thinking: We hypothesize that conspiratorial thinking as an explanation for events increases as the probability of those events decreases. In order to test this hypothesis, we have conducted five experiments in which participants were exposed to different information about probabilities of fictional events. The results of all  experiments support the hypothesis: The lower the probability of an event, the stronger participants embrace conspiratorial explanations.

This study uses the OSMnx software to automatically download and analyze 27,000 US street networks from OpenStreetMap at metropolitan, municipal, and neighborhood scales - namely, every US city and town, census urbanized area, and Zillow-defined neighborhood. It presents empirical findings on US urban form and street network characteristics, emphasizing measures relevant to graph theory, transportation, urban design, and morphology such as structure, connectedness, density, centrality, and resilience. In the past, street network data acquisition and processing have been challenging and ad hoc. This study illustrates the use of OSMnx and OpenStreetMap to consistently conduct street network analysis with extremely large sample sizes, with clearly defined network definitions and extents for reproducibility, and using nonplanar, directed graphs. These street networks and measures data have been shared in a public repository for other researchers to use.",TRUE,FALSE,average node connectivity|betweenness centrality|big data|centrality|connectivity|density|geospatial|GIS|graph theory|land use|neighborhood|network analysis|networks|OpenStreetMap|OSMnx|python|resilience|spatial analysis|street network|transportation|urban design|urban form|urban morphology|urban planning|Zillow,2018-07-02T10:51:03.171146,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-29T20:31:46.757000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/citation/,hmhts,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4mcfw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/relationships/node/,4mcfw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58dc18c0594d9001f79750a9/,58dc18c0594d9001f79750a9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmhts/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hmhts/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808318784595,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hmhts
