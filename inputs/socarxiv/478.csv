Probing into the instrumental efforts made via the colonizer’s language entails investigating the way the colonizer sought to racially segregate the Moroccan subjects, ascertain inaccessibility to religion, and instill the colonial language and the associated foreign ‘elitist’ values via the educational policies initially established within the postcolonial project. French language reflects a colonialism, of which the nature was racial, religious, linguistic, and identity based. The ensuing postcolonial effects of the curriculum adopted during the ‘protectorate’ have given birth to the surviving outcomes of Francization and the need to adopt French—a language that is foreign, ‘prestigious,’ ‘elitist,’ and practical in the job market.

It puts forward irony as the vehicle for shifting the traditional stature of the hero, and his successful errand towards the anti-hero as the apotheosis of doom and failure. The paper suggests history’s force of abruptness as undeniable in the unsuccessful quest of the hero through the shattering historical events Charles Frazier (1950-) and Philip Roth (1933-) create in their modern novels, Cold Mountain (1997) and Nemesis (2010). It furthermore gets in-depth within the romantic psyche of both heroes to get across that their ‘consciousness’ is, in fact, mythical and not historical. Absence of historical consciousness in these characters, it is explained, participates considerably in the collapse which gets them eventually. Even the pastoral round which their aspiration hovers becomes a site for death and paralysis instead of the rejuvenation they sought after passionately. The larger canvas is then that of strife between romance and history, dream and reality drawn by the postmodern spirit inclination towards the double and the upturned.",TRUE,FALSE,cold mountain|historical consciousness|ironic romance|nemesis|postmodern anti-hero,2019-07-25T18:31:04.806616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:30:44.789261,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/citation/,rngqh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ncqjr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/relationships/node/,ncqjr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b84a6f1465d21001806fb41/,5b84a6f1465d21001806fb41,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rngqh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rngqh/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no3.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rngqh

Rapid changes in labor force participation, access to high-paying jobs, and gender attitudes have radically altered the meaning of education for women’s lives and their dependence on the socioeconomic attainments of their families. Drawing on three nationally representative, longitudinal surveys conducted from 1967 to 2012, this study examines how personal, parental, and spousal attainments contribute to the widening education gap in health for successive cohorts of white women (N = 8,405). Overall, the health of women did not change substantially across cohorts, but results did uncover cohort differences among low-educated women that were linked to parental and spousal educational attainments and personal earnings.

Recent technological advances have made it easy for archaeologists to rely on Geographic Information Systems’ least-cost path tools to identify the single easiest path to move between two points set in a realistically rugged landscape; however, least-cost path tools work on the assumption that the whole world is perfectly known, which does not represent human mobility accurately in all cases. Here, we present an agent-based least-cost path (AB-LCP) model, which does not make the assumption of complete landscape knowledge, and allows creating multiple anisotropic least-cost paths that take the traveler’s local perspective and incomplete knowledge into consideration. We demonstrate the model’s potential through a case study of the geographical distribution of Cantabrian (Spain) Lower Magdalenian engraved scapulae, which provides an interesting extension to current understanding of Magdalenian mobility, showcasing the flexibility and potential of this new LCP tool to study archaeological landscapes. The results of our study suggest that the studied engraved scapulae may have been created at El Castillo, and then brought to Altamira for transmission to other sites. The results show that El Castillo was strategically located on a bottleneck for coastal-to-plain mobility, whereas Altamira was located along social paths connecting other contemporaneous sites. This supports the already-accepted notion that both sites may have served for Upper Paleolithic population aggregation. However, our research builds on this idea by explaining why these two sites would have become so important. We suggest that Altamira was strategically placed near the boundary of inter-regional groups, thus taking the role as an aggregation site for unrelated populations, whereas El Castillo would have been used by the intra-regional group population to congregate during the summer and take advantage of the local mosaic of resources.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-based model|Altamira|El Castillo|El Cierro|Geographic Information System|Least-cost path|Lower Magdalenian|Mobility,2018-08-28T00:30:45.808202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-28T00:27:13.793097,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/citation/,ac2r6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f2ymj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/relationships/node/,f2ymj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8432c1465d210018068a3b/,5b8432c1465d210018068a3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ac2r6/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2018.08.014,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ac2r6

We replicate 21 systematically selected experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015. The replications follow analysis plans reviewed by the original authors and pre-registered prior to the replications. The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57%) and 14 (67%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true positive rate is 67% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility.

Experimental evidence on hiring discrimination against parents with differing lengths of family leave","This study examines how changes in the traditional division of childcare responsibilities affect mothers’ and fathers’  likelihood of getting a job. Can women overcome motherhood penalties by quickly returning to their jobs after childbirth? Do employers discriminate against fathers who take extended family leave? To answer these questions, I exploit some unique features of the parental leave system and job application process in Germany. The findings from my field experiment show that mothers who take nothing beyond the mandatory leave of two months are 50 percent less likely to be invited to a job interview than mothers who stay home for a year after childbirth. There is, however, no difference between fathers with short vs. long leave. With my laboratory experiment I disentangle the underlying mechanisms for these findings. Employers may value different traits in fathers with short and long family leave, which in sum tend to cancel each other out but discriminate against mothers who “lean in” and “act like men” for violating prevailing gender norms.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|experiment|family leave|gender|parenthood,2018-08-27T23:19:25.484907,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-27T18:12:28.808667,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Lena Hipp,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/citation/,qsm4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dez3m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/relationships/node/,dez3m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b83c315d11be7001adf6598/,5b83c315d11be7001adf6598,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qsm4x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qsm4x
