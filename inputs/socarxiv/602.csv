It shows how ideology controls speech and how the translator should use certain jargons in his translation as a weapon of resistance to refute the superiority implied in the occupier's discourse. The study also investigates whether Palestinian translators would counter ‘interpellation’ as a strategy of resistance through translation. For this purpose, 30 participants of translation students at the English Language department at IUG were tested. The test consisted of 10 sentences incorporating 12 highly sensitive terms. Another data collection method was a questionnaire administered to 11 male MA translation students. The questionnaire included 13 statements that tackle the issues of visibility, ideology, and neutrality in translation. The participants showed a highly emotive and ideological tendency in translating such terms.

The study attempts to achieve these aims by looking at the pragmatic concept of presupposition in translation studies, guided by micro-translation strategies of cultural themes. The study employs Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (1943) and Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions (1984) to analyze the translation of three cultural themes: methods of persuasion, stereotypes, and humor. Further themes, per each cultural themes are explored: persuasion through foreignization, persuasion through localization of norms and preferences, persuasion through adapting types of register, portraying the Arab culture as storytellers, verbalizing stereotypes through linguistic clichés and idioms, hyperbole in humor, and modification of irony in humor. The study concludes that micro-translation strategies: (1) in terms of cultural themes, are not exclusive to either a Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or a vernacular Arabic dialect; and (2) are used concurrently across cultural sub-themes.",TRUE,FALSE,Advertisement translation|Arabic dialects|cultural translation|dubbing|localization|Modern Standard Arabic|transcreation,2018-07-02T11:10:45.840565,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:46:38.052629,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/citation/,jv8m9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4s8wh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/relationships/node/,4s8wh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab6c3fb83f69025bb446f5/,59ab6c3fb83f69025bb446f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv8m9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jv8m9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jv8m9

The overuse and the misuse of translation in the heydays of these methods paved the way to the monolingual assumption that English should be taught without the inclusion of translation activities in the classroom. However, in the last few decades, there has been ongoing research re-evaluating the use of translation in the EFL context. Drawing upon several studies conducted in this respect, researchers discussed the main objections raised against the use of translation and set the benefits of this teaching tool in facilitating the students’ language learning process. On the basis of the findings of these studies, the present article aims at exploring teachers’ attitudes towards the use and usefulness of translation in English classes in the Algerian EFL context. Due to the huge gap between the literature on the importance of translation and its practice on the ground , this article attempts to confirm the validity of this pedagogical tool and suggest some guidelines as to how and when to integrate translation activities within the teaching of English as a foreign language.  The data were collected through a questionnaire addressed to secondary school teachers working in different cities in Algeria. Though it has never been practised in a principled and purposeful way, translation, has gained a wide recognition from secondary school teachers who reported that this pedagogical tool played a considerable role in facilitating foreign language learning and improving language skills.

The words are used and then expanded further in a way as if it has never been spoken before. It is the repetition or duplication of words; however; it has been argued that every repetition is not a tautology. Poets use this part of speech in their work for many years. Owing to its principal use in poems, it deserves an investigatory research work. This study aims at analyzing ‘tautologies’ in William Wordsworth’s poem “The Thorn” from the viewpoint of stylistic analysis. This analysis can show the significance of the use of tautological words to conclude whether tautologies produce redundancy or make a poem beautiful. Leech (1969) is the model adopted in analyzing the selected poem where the concept of “Foregrounding"" is introduced as being considered an important field of stylistic analysis. The analysis is quantitative where a statistical analysis is conducted. It is hypothesized that tautology is redundancy, whereas the findings reveal it as an expression of the depth of the human feelings. Wordsworth has successfully used tautology to achieve the themes included in his poem.

Taking the film Утомленные Солнцем (Burnt by the Sun) as a case study, the authors aim to describe translation strategies for transadapting cultural realia in their own Arabic dubbing script, and to look at them from the perspective of the translation norms that are operational in the Arab society. For the analysis of strategies of transadapting cultural realia into Arabic, the researchers use the taxonomy developed by Pedersen (Pedersen, 2005). They also employ the concept of norms by Toury (Toury, (1995/2012)) since these norms take into account cultural and social constraints of the community, which have an impact on the translator’s choices. The results of the study show that mostly source text-oriented strategies were used for transadapting the Soviet Russia cultural realia, with the exception of the realia belonging to the category of linguistic culture.

The first pre-translation phase consists in introducing the author, his/her works, style and the text to be translated. The second phase, the translation proper, is divided into three sub-phases: (a) the identification of problems (connotative meanings, figures of speech, idioms, uncommon collocations, culture-bound items, …), (b) the treatment of these problems by opting for the adequate procedures which should be in tune with the overall translation strategy opted for, and (c) the translation of the whole text into the target language. The final third phase is of revision and assessment. The criteria to be taken into consideration are genre-related and the focus is on the stylistic match or mismatch between the source and target texts. The present process-oriented method of literary translation is illustrated through three in-class translations of three literary texts from Arabic into English and vice versa. The targeted students are enrolled in the Master of Translation Science and Linguistics during Fall-Semester 2017 at the Faculty of Humanities at the University Abdelmalek Essaadi.

Lessing portrays a world in which oppression by a male-dominated society is at the root of countless problems. It depicts the effects of global warming in the future emphasizing that the domination of women is the core of all crises in the environment. The novel implies that women are able to lead as most of the female characters in the novel play the role of the leader starting from Daima, the woman who protects Mara and Dann as children, to Orphne the woman who heals Dann from addiction. Applying Greta Claire Gaard’s (1993) principles of ecofeminism to literature classifies and justifies the cause of the movement (p. 20). This paper sheds light on Gaard’s four types of ecofeminism in Lessing’s Rama and Dann: An Adventure: liberal, culture, social and socialist by discussing the apocalypses, patriarchal legacy, pathetic fallacy and radical orthodoxies as features of ecofeminism.",TRUE,FALSE,apocalypses|ecofeminism|pathetic fallacy|patriarchal legacy|radical orthodoxies,2018-07-02T11:10:45.632983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:18:56.396856,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/citation/,gf8wr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dxhy2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/relationships/node/,dxhy2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab65ea594d9002547de7f7/,59ab65ea594d9002547de7f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf8wr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gf8wr/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gf8wr

It is also an attempt to examine the stylistic effects of using speech acts (SAs) and their implication in conveying the theme of the play and the intentions of the characters. Therefore, eight extracts are selected from Harold Pinter's Plays : A Night Out and The Birthday party, to be the data of analysis. The analysis reveals that the interaction between stylistics and pragmatics is a vital tool for analyzing dramatic texts in terms of (SAT). SAs are grouped into systematic combination depending on the purpose of the speaker or the playwright. Direct of fit is the most decisive aspect of the combination of some hybrid speech acts. The pragma-stylistics analysis of hybrid (SAs) also reveals the importance of these speech acts in conveying the intended message of the dramatist through the contextual details offered about the characters and events. These details can secure a proper interpretation of the socio-psychological relationships between the characters and the audience of the play.",TRUE,FALSE,felicity conditions|Hybrid speech acts|pragma-stylistics,2018-07-02T11:10:45.596935,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:14:54.034522,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/citation/,pdg3k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rbw3h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/relationships/node/,rbw3h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab64bfb83f69025ab3bc71/,59ab64bfb83f69025ab3bc71,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdg3k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pdg3k/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pdg3k

It also examines the amount of translation loss resulting from this process. Moreover, the paper highlights some reasons which made translators of the meanings of the Holy Quran lose sight of part of the culture-bound, culture sensitive and language-bound schemata. Euphemism and synonymy, however, were addressed in so far as schemata are concerned. The paper also endeavors to suggest solutions, when possible, to make up for the amount of translation loss resulting from the formal or functional equivalence opted for by many translators of the meanings of the Holy Quran which led to the activation of slightly, and sometimes utterly, different schemata. However, the translation loss is inevitable in many cases. The findings of the present paper are expected to be useful information in the translation of the meanings of the Holy Quran studies and other related areas. Three prominent translations of the meanings of Holy Quran (Abdullah Ali, Pickthall, and Al-Hilali and Khan) were consulted and resorted to tackle the main premise of the study along with one commendable Qur’anic exegesis (Ibn Katheer).",TRUE,FALSE,culture-bound|functional equivalence|schemata|The Holy Quran|translation loss,2018-07-02T11:10:45.563144,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:10:07.447264,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/citation/,8rgkm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gywx5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/relationships/node/,gywx5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab63a96c613b02526a183e/,59ab63a96c613b02526a183e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rgkm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8rgkm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8rgkm
