Although a variety of explanations have been put forth for this epidemiological pattern, questions remain about the socio-historical generalizability of the empirical findings and accompanying theoretical explanations. By examining childhood mortality patterns of European immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century, this study tests hypotheses from current immigrant health literature in a previous era of immigration. In contrast with post-1965 immigrant groups, European arrivals did not have better outcomes than their U.S.-born white counterparts. Rather, their rates corresponded to a ""middle tier"" status in between U.S.-born black and white populations. Analysis of post-migration trajectories returned mixed results that similarly differ from contemporary patterns. Many new immigrant groups had higher rates of excess childhood mortality than their U.S-born counterparts, but outcomes generally improved with duration of residence or among the second generation. These findings highlight the influence of socio-historical variation in the context of reception on patterns of immigrant health and mortality outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,assimilation|epidemiological paradox|European immigration|immigrant health,2018-07-02T11:48:07.940627,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-04T21:44:41.552346,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/citation/,cg3j9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/txarg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/relationships/node/,txarg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac51d35db30240011ead747/,5ac51d35db30240011ead747,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg3j9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cg3j9/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2018.06.004,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cg3j9

Exploring the economic returns to cultural capital,"Cultural consumption is often viewed as a form of embodied cultural capital which can be converted into economic rewards because such practices increase the likelihood of moving into more advantaged social positions. However, quantitative evidence supporting this proposition remains uncertain because it is often unable to rule out alternative explanations. Cultural consumption appears to influence hiring decisions in some elite firms, in both the U.S. and the U.K., but it is unclear whether these processes are applicable to other professional occupations and other labour market processes such as promotions. We examine these processes using data from Understanding Society, an individual-level panel survey conducted in the UK, allowing us to explore whether cultural consumption predicts future earnings, upward social mobility, and promotions. People who consume a larger number of cultural activities are more likely to earn higher wages in the future, to be upwardly socially mobile, and to be promoted. Cultural consumption, then, can function as cultural capital in some labour market settings, potentially contributing to the reproduction of income inequality between generations.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural capital|cultural consumption|Earnings|hiring|labour market,2018-07-02T11:48:07.004499,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-09T17:09:26.242176,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/citation/,268ns,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/djfk7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/relationships/node/,djfk7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac4c63029ad60000c3369a7/,5ac4c63029ad60000c3369a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/268ns/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/268ns/,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12374,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/268ns

We follow the classification developed by Meguid (2008) and use a probabilistic topic model approach to analyze the 300,000 speeches delivered in the Swedish parliament between 1994 and 2017. Our results indicate that immigration became a more prevalent topic in party leader debates when the Sweden Democrats entered the parliament in 2010. The other parties started to address immigration more, but still not to the extent that the Sweden Democrats did. In 2015, as Sweden faced a migration crisis, immigration became a more salient issue in the parliamentary debates. This could be seen as an external shock that forced the mainstream parties to put more emphasis on the topic of immigration. We conclude that the mainstream parties used a partly dismissive, partly adversarial strategy in their speeches when the SD entered the parliament.

In this analysis, I estimate the impact of the changing relative size of the adult male population, classified by age and education groups, on the earnings of employed males living in 502 Brazilian local labor markets during four time periods between 1970 and 2000. The effects of shifts in the age distribution of the working age population have been studied in relation to the effect of the baby-boom generation on the earnings of different cohorts in the United States. However, the question has received little attention in the context of the countries in Asia and Latin America, which are now experiencing substantial shifts in their age-education distributions. Taking advantage of the huge variation across Brazilian local labor markets, the models in this research suggest that age-education groups are not perfect substitutes, so that own-cohort-education size depresses earnings, as expected by the theory. Compositional shifts are influential, attesting that this approach represents a fruitful way of studying this central problem in economic development, going beyond the effects normally analyzed by formal labor market equations.",TRUE,FALSE,Brasil|Brazil|Cohort size|Demografia|Demographic|Demographic change|Demographic transition|Demography|Earnings|Economic development|Educação|Education|Educational|Educational change|Educational transition|Labor market|Mercado de trabalho|Mudanças demográficas|Mudanças educacionais|Rendimento|Tamanho da coorte|Transição demográfica|Transição educacional,2018-07-02T11:48:05.915162,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-04T10:32:22.999828,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/citation/,xbzr7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g2b5j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/relationships/node/,g2b5j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac3c2dcf595fc000e6a1005/,5ac3c2dcf595fc000e6a1005,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbzr7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbzr7

Since the 70’s, the Brazilian Middle-West Region has experienced an important modernization process in agricultural and industrial activities, which has led to an employment retraction and migration flows, especially from rural areas to the major metropolitan cities of the region. In this research the focus of analysis are the State of Goiás and the Federal District, which encompasses Brasília, the capital of Brazil. In order to understand the new population configuration, the region was divided into four sub-areas (micro-region of Goiânia, micro-region of Entorno de Brasília, the Federal District, and a group of 16 micro-regions of Goiás) and the patterns of migration, by age and sex, were estimated for the periods 1975-1979 and 1986-1991. In addition, differences between native and migrant population of each sub-area, according to the participation in the labor force, income, education and type of migration were investigated. The analysis was performed on the basis of the 1980 and 1991 Brazilian Census data.

In the intra-state migration, the fluxes between the micro-region of Goiânia and the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás, and between the Federal District and the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília were the most important. In the inter-state migration, the flux from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and the North region to the 16 micro-regions of Goiás, as well as the flux from Northeast, Southeast and South to the Federal District were significant. But there was a decline in the migration to the Federal District, between 1975-1979 and 1986-1991, while, in the same period, the migration to the Entorno of Brasília increased.

The chance of the migrant population in the micro-region of Goiânia and in the Federal District to have worked in the last 12 months prior to census interview was lower than that of the native population. However, those who migrated from the Federal District to the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília had higher chance to have worked in the formal sector than those who did not migrate. Migrants who moved from the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília and the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás to the micro-region of Goiânia had lower wages than the non-migrant population. The lowest level of wages was recorded for the migrants to the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás. Migrants living in the Federal District had high level of education, while those migrants living in the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília had low level of education.

In 1986-1990, the micro-regions of Goiânia and Entorno de Brasília, as well as the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás, presented a high percentage of returned migrants. In the same period, a major proportion of migrants to the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília had first moved from Southeast or from the Federal District to others regions. In addition, there was a considerable proportion of migrants with low income who had moved from Northeast to the Federal District and then to the micro-region of the Entorno de Brasília.

Future research could focus other areas or regions of Brazil, and could also explore the same kind of analysis, on the basis of the incoming 2000 Brazilian Census, which requires the development of new techniques, as it did not collect information on the city of previous residence, but only on the state of residence.",TRUE,FALSE,Brasil|Brasília|Brazil|Central-West|Centro-Oeste|Distrito Federal|Educação|Education|Employment|Emprego|Entorno de Brasília|Federal District|Goiânia|Goiás|Mato Grosso|Mato Grosso do Sul|Micro-region|Microrregião|Middle-West|Migração|Migration|Migration rate|Migration rates|Nordeste|Norte|North|Northeast|South|Southeast|Sudeste|Sul|Taxa de migração|Taxas de migração,2018-07-02T11:48:05.884391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-04T10:33:30.748695,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,05/24/2002,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/citation/,2k8rs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tqb69/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/relationships/node/,tqb69,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac3be6729ad60000f313b71/,5ac3be6729ad60000f313b71,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2k8rs/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2k8rs

Drawing on documentary sources, ethnographic fieldwork, and 52 interviews with financial economists and market participants, this article addresses this question by tracing the development and adoption of the mathematical models and associated infrastructures that derivatives ‘dealer’ banks use to assign value to the counterparty risk embedded in the ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives contracts they trade. Rather than reflecting a pre-existing consensus on the part of financial market participants in favour of valuation practices drawn from financial economics, this article suggests that the switch to fair value actively shaped the financial modelling and risk management practices used by dealers to value and manage this risk. While a number of material and institutional factors shaped the adoption of these practices, the switch to fair value ultimately ‘tipped the balance’ in favor of a particular set of practices that were preferred by a minority of investment banks. In explaining the development and adoption of banks’ counterparty risk modelling practices, this paper develops a hybrid theoretical approach that combines organisational institutionalism’s focus on meso-level field dynamics and the social studies of finance’s focus on materiality.",TRUE,FALSE,fair value|financial modelling|institutional logics|materiality|social studies of finance|valuation practices,2018-07-02T11:48:03.741459,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-02T14:00:25.269969,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c63|Law|Accounting Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Taylor C.
