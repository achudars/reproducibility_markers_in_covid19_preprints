Shakespeare’s texts are rife with metaphoric language which serves multiple functions on the cognitive, cultural, pragmatic as well as stylistic levels. This paper aims to analyse the translation of literary metaphors from a stylistic perspective in Mohamed Enani’s version of Othello. The analysis is conducted in the framework of conceptual metaphor theory which provides a microscopic description of how metaphors are influenced by the translation process. The findings of the analysis unveil the translation strategy adopted by Enani to reflect the stylistic function of metaphors while preserving their cognitive content and reveals that translating metaphors is influenced by the cognitive and professional background of the translator. Amplification emerges as a successful translation strategy which is used to extend metaphors creatively thus adding cognitive value to the Source Text content and compensating for a possible loss in the style of the Target Text. This paper concludes that, contrary to the prevalent assumptions, a source-text-oriented approach can deliver an accurate yet stylistically-functional translation if the translator is creative enough and willing to exert an additional cognitive effort similar to that exerted by the original writer. Enani’s translations of Shakespeare into Arabic are worth a life-long research project on the translation of style in literature.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-10T01:06:01.164147,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T01:05:12.690687,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/citation/,gcyxv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa4594b9c4dcb01a3e46ae6/,5fa4594b9c4dcb01a3e46ae6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gcyxv/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no4.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gcyxv

It works via the exploration of both protocols set by a number of the major founders of both theories aiming to reveal the oppositions, commonalities as well as undeclared similarities. The critical controversy will thus be brought to light, in a bid to point out the shortcomings of each approach. Throughout this exploration, the study demonstrates that the ontological approach of the New Critics becomes incomplete and doubtful. It proves that the New Critics’ ‘affective fallacy’ has sprouted the postmodern theory of the reader-response criticism where the reader is no longer a passive recipient, but an active agent who fills in the blanks and formulates meanings. Thus, the study concludes by proving that there are some commonalities between the New Critics and the Reader-response adherents highlighting the triumph of the latter in undermining the New Critics’ objectivity.  The significance of the study lies in adopting the reader-response approach per se in the re-reading of the New Critics’ doctrines where the researcher comes up with new findings that testifies the crucial role of the reader/researcher in the production of new interpretations.

They have to face unemployment and poverty because machines replaced workers in their work, causing the downsize of the numbers of the workers. The current paper examines how Lunn Nottage explores the de-industrial landscape of Reading town in Pennsylvania to display the impact of the economic crisis on the working-class community. Sweat unveils the dire conditions of work in the factory where those workers used to work and their suffering after losing their jobs. The employers and the government marginalized those workers as being invisible. The playwright set the play between 2000-2008 to present the economic and financial transformations, which consequently have motivated racial hostilities among the different ethnic groups of workers. The paper’s aim is to reveal the impact of poverty and unemployment on raising the evil inside human nature. The significance of the study lies in showing who is to be blamed for racial and hostile actions among various ethnic groups and the reasons for them.

Kundera’s style seems at first plain, but greater importance was given to his philosophical and psychological treatment of subjects than the narratological world that he creates. He brilliantly mixes many narrative techniques to expose his existential and aesthetic ideals. The aesthetic value of the novel studied under the cognitive stylistic approach in this study sought answers to the following question. How can Life Is Elsewhere (1973) be read from a cognitive linguistic perspective? The findings confirmed the relevance of the cognitive poetic approach to the narrow reading of Milan Kundera’s works. Life Is Elsewhere (1973) is a merit of narrative control in that the author allows the reader to live the life story of a young poet, to appreciate his ups and downs, at the same time, read his philosophical ideas about life and his artistic control of the novel. Though a cognitively inspired approach might seem odd at the thematic level, for a purely hermeneutic researcher, the level at which both author and reader would exchange meaning from the text is catered for in the rich textual world of the novel.

We find that conditions in a refugee’s home country are the primary drivers of return intentions. Refugees’ decisions are influenced primarily by safety and security in their place of origin, their economic prospects, the availability of public services, and their personal networks. Confidence in information is also important, as several drivers of return only impact intentions among people who have high confidence in their information. By contrast, the conditions in refugee–hosting countries––so-called “push” factors––play a much smaller role.

Taking the case of Germany, we study the relationship between embeddedness of benefit recipients in activating labor market institutions and individual labor supply. Using panel data, we estimate the effects of transitions between key institutional states with different degrees of activation on reservation wages. We show that reservation wages are sensitive to activation: The transition from gainful employment into unemployment benefit receipt leads to an average 3.2 percent decrease in reservation wages. The transition from gainful employment into welfare benefit receipt - an institutional state with far more rigorous activation - leads to a stronger decrease of 4.9 percent. Mediation analyses show that the income associated with different institutional states is the predominant mechanism that drives the effect on reservation wages.

We introduce a detailed classification of demographic window (DW) phases, determine how these phases are distributed among and within LMICs, and analyze the relationship between the DW and economic growth for 1,921 urban and rural areas of sub-national regions. Many regions in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East have entered the window, but most of sub-Saharan Africa is still in the traditional or pre-window phase. Multilevel analyses reveal higher growth rates in areas with lower and decreasing dependency ratios. Demographic effects are stronger in rural, more developed and more educated regions. Findings indicate that, in the coming years, the DW might strengthen economic growth in rural areas of LMICs, and particularly if accompanied by investments in education and rural development.",TRUE,FALSE,Demographic Window|Developing Countries|Economic Growth|Fertility Reduction|Subnational level,2020-11-05T11:51:20.888072,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-05T11:48:55.029800,FALSE,NA,no,Data available post-print.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Lamar Crombach &amp; Jeroen Smits,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/citation/,pytqe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa3d89e9c4dcb015fe495cb/,5fa3d89e9c4dcb015fe495cb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pytqe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pytqe/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pytqe

Thus, the health emergency turned rapidly into in an economic crisis. The Covid-19 crisis in Europe increased the uncertainty about the economic recovery and the end of the health emergency. This situation is supposed to have conditioned individuals’ life course path with the effect of inducing people to postpone or to abandon many life plans. 
This paper aims to explore whether the rise of health emergency due to the Covid-19 has delayed or vanished young people intention to leave the parental home during the 2020 in five European countries: Italy, Germany, France, Spain and UK. Using data from an international survey from the “Youth Project”, carried out by the Toniolo Institute of Advanced Studies, this paper implements ordered logistic models in order to investigate the determinants of a possible revision of the choice of leaving the parental home for a representative sample of 6,000 respondents aged 18 to 34, interviewed between March and April 2020. A special focus has been pointed on the Italian case, because of being the first European country to be strongly hit by the pandemic and because of the already economic vulnerable conditions of its young population.
Results reports that Italy is the country with the highest rate of downward revisions of the intentions of leaving the nest. In particular, having negative expectations about changes in the individual’s and family’s future income is a key predictor of the choice of abandoning the purpose of leaving the parental home across Europe. However, the vulnerability of the category of temporary workers arises especially in Italy: young people with precarious jobs seems to be the most prone to negatively revise their intentions of leaving, even compared with those not working.",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|Covid-19|Intentions|Leaving parental home|SARS-CoV2,2020-11-05T11:55:01.867134,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-05T11:50:42.945330,FALSE,NA,no,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from Istituto Toniolo but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available.
