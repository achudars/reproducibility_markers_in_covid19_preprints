sizeable number of military personnel transition into civilian careers every year, but little is 
known about the impact of this transition. 
Objective: This systematic narrative review aims to consider the international evidence about 
military personnel’s experience of transition to civilian employment.
Methods: Four bibliographic databases were searched for published research about fulltime 
regular military veterans in civilian employment. Twenty-three studies were identified that 
included both qualitative and quantitative research. These studies were graded as moderate to 
good quality.
Results: Four themes emerged from the review: the value of military experience; successful 
career transition; the difference between military and civilian employment; identity as a veteran.
Key points were: veterans might hold a naive view of the value of their military experience;
being able to transfer job skills to civilian employment may be an advantage; there were 
differences between the military and civilian workplace; constructing a civilian workplace 
identity included adjusting to different workplace values. 
Conclusion: Further research into the experience of deciding to leave the armed forces may 
help the armed forces to develop strategies for retaining personnel. No study focussed solely 
upon midlife career change and research into this area is important because military careers 
typically finish midlife.",TRUE,FALSE,Career; Military; Veteran; Retirement; Transition,2021-05-02T23:52:45.113485,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-02T23:52:14.138028,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Dean Whybrow; Christine Milligan,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/citation/,ahc6r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608e4f5319183d01de54fa91/,608e4f5319183d01de54fa91,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahc6r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ahc6r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ahc6r,NA

The three sequential stages of the rational response to fear- fear, denial, and frustration, have been reported as predominant among quarantined individuals during any outbreak. To our knowledge, this was one of the first studies to assess the impact of the first case of COVID-19 among the neighbouring dwellers. Methods: A semi-qualitative study was conducted through telephonic interviews. Detailed descriptions of the experiences of the inhabitants after coming to know about the first incidence of a patient of COVID-19 in the locality were obtained. Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Semi-structured in-depth telephonic interviews were done at a time convenient for participants between April 9 to 11, 2020. Results: Source of information for all the participants was from a neighbour and the participants came to know about the news on 7th of April 2020. All the participants were aware of the correct attitudes and practices of the general public to be followed during the pandemic including hand hygiene, use of face masks, social distancing and adhering to the government lockdown rules. Mixed reactions of panic, fear and confusion were obtained. Most participants were concerned about children and elderly at home, financial constraints due to the blockage of the locality from adjoining areas, everyday hassles that they were about to experience, etc. Despite most participants having minimal fear of contracting the illness themselves, fear of a family member acquiring the same seemed to be significantly higher on hearing the news. Conclusion
The study adds to the existing literature that fear and anxiety during a pandemic are mostly due to the uncertainty related to the disease spread and misinformation. There is a need for phased and well informed lockdown implementation and better knowledge propagation among the general public in order to mitigate unwanted fear and panic among the general public.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|fear|locality|reactions|semi qualitative method|stigma,2021-05-02T23:51:54.144474,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-02T23:51:31.720645,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/citation/,wc5y6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608e2cf56801ab01d42aa8f2/,608e2cf56801ab01d42aa8f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc5y6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wc5y6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wc5y6,NA

How-ever, algebraic transformations reveal that this strategy does not yield a within-unit estimator. Instead, the standard FE interaction estimator reflects unit-level differences of the interacted variables. This property allows interactions of a time-constant variable and a time-varying variable in FE, but may yield unwanted results if both variables vary within units. In such cases, Monte Carlo experiments confirm that the standard FE estimator of z∙x is biased if x is correlated with an unobserved unit-specific moderator of z (or vice-versa). A within estimator of an interaction can be obtained by first demeaning each variable and then demeaning their product.

Against this backdrop, this study sought to examine how creative laborers’ pursuit of social media visibility impacts their processes and products. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 30 aspiring and professional content creators—including Instagrammers, YouTubers, TikTok creators, and those seeking monetization through Pinterest and Twitter—we contend that their experiences are not only shaped by the promise of visibility, but also by its precarity. As such, we present a framework for assessing the volatile nature of visibility in platformized creative labor, which includes unpredictability across three levels: (1) markets, (2) industries, and (3) platform features and algorithms.

Quasi-experimental evidence from Norway,"Ethnic or racial segregation in schools and neighborhoods remains a persistent reality in most major cities in Western countries. Although extensively theorized, determining the exact mechanisms that produce such patterns has proven difficult. In this article, we investigate one of the potential causes of ethnic segregation in schools; native flight motivated by parents’ school preferences. Both observational and experimental evidence suggests that native or White parents have a strong preference for racially or ethnically homogeneous schools. If this is the case, this may strongly contribute to school segregation. In contexts where school enrollment is determined primarily by geographic proximity to schools, such preferences may prompt White or native parents to move away from schools with high racial or ethnic minority shares among students, thus contributing to both residential and school segregation. Drawing on extremely detailed, population-wide, geo-coded register data on families and school catchment areas for elementary schools in Oslo, the capital of Norway, we investigate whether native parents move away from schools with higher shares students with non-Western immigrant backgrounds. We employ a Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design by exploiting the fact that within neighborhoods, the characteristics of schools differ discontinuously along school catchment area borders. The results indicate that native origin families systematically move away from schools with high shares of students with non-Western immigrant backgrounds.

This suggests arts engagement constitutes health-promoting behaviour in older age. However, there are no large-scale studies examining how the predictors of arts engagement vary with age. 

Methods: Data from the Health and Retirement Study (2014) were used to identify sociodemographic, life satisfaction, social, and arts appreciation predictors of (1) frequency of arts engagement, (2) cultural attendance, (3) difficulty participating in the arts, and (4) being an interested non-attendee of cultural events. Logistic regression models were stratified by age groups [50-59, 60-69, 70] for the frequency of arts participation outcome and [50-69 vs 70] all other outcomes. 

Results: Findings indicated a number of age-related predictors of frequent arts engagement, including gender, educational attainment, wealth, dissatisfaction with ageing, and instrumental activities of daily living (iADL). For cultural event attendance, lower interest in the arts predicted lack of engagement across age groups, whereas higher educational attainment and more frequent religious service attendance became predictors in older age groups (&gt; 70). Adults in both age groups were less likely to report difficulties engaging in the arts if they had lower neighbourhood safety, whilst poor self-rated health and low arts appreciation also predicted reduced likelihood of this outcome, but only in the younger (50-69) age group. Adults in the older (&gt; 70) age group were more likely to be interested non-attendees of cultural events if they had higher educational attainment and less likely if they lived in neighbourhoods with low levels of safety. 

Conclusions: Our results suggest that certain factors become stronger predictors of arts and cultural engagement and barriers to engagement as people age. Further, there appear to be socioeconomic inequalities in engagement that may increase in older ages, with arts activities overall more accessible as individuals age compared to cultural engagement due to additional financial barriers and transportation barriers. Ensuring that these activities are accessible to people of all ages will allow older adults to benefit from the range of health outcomes gained from arts and cultural engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,age|arts|cross-sectional|culture|health|wellbeing,2021-05-06T15:16:03.764743,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-06T15:15:07.892806,FALSE,NA,no,Data from the Covid-19 Social Study will be made publicly available following the end of the pandemic.,,no,This research was not preregistered.,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/citation/,8pcux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608b05a519183d0084550fc9/,608b05a519183d0084550fc9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pcux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8pcux/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8pcux,NA
