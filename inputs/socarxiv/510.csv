Yet, there is limited research on the relation between disagreement and liquidity, particularly regarding how disagreement affects private information's impact on trading and liquidity.  This paper proposes a model in which trading is entirely generated by disagreement stemming from overconfident interpretation of private signals. Contrary to traditional intuition, the model predicts that private information increases trading and enhances liquidity. A more general version of the model incorporates both disagreement and liquidity trading. The general model relates traditional intuition about private information destroying liquidity and trade to disagreement trading. The relation between private information and liquidity is not monotonic. Private information at first decreases liquidity but then enhances it, potentially explaining why private information seems to destroy liquidity in money markets but not in markets that are more informationally sensitive to start with.",TRUE,FALSE,disagreement|liquidity|overconfidence|private information,2018-12-19T11:37:07.910013,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-19T11:36:41.281216,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,Samuel Kruger,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/citation/,mfx6w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1976c05757c500180e9b28/,5c1976c05757c500180e9b28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfx6w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mfx6w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mfx6w,NA

We use archived Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data from four North American transit agencies to produce a detailed reconstruction of actual transit vehicle movements over the course of five days in a format that allows for travel time estimation directly comparable to schedule-based GTFS. With travel times estimated on both schedule-based and retrospective networks, we compute and compare a variety of accessibility measures. We find that origin-based accessibility even when averaged over one-hour periods can vary widely between locations. Origins with lower scheduled access tend to produce less reliable estimates with more variability from hour to hour in real accessibility, while higher access zones seem to converge on an estimate 5-15\% lower than the schedule predicts. Such over- and under-predictions exhibit strong spatial patterns which should be of concern to those using accessibility metrics in statistical models. Momentary measures of accessibility are briefly discussed and found to be weakly related to momentary changes in real access. These findings bring into question the validity of some recent applications of GTFS data and point the way toward more robust methods for calculating accessibility.",TRUE,FALSE,access|accessibility|General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS|Jacksonville Transportation Authority|MBTA|opentripplanner|public transport|SF Muni|Toronto|Toronto Transit Commission|transit|TTC,2018-12-18T10:02:21.536980,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-18T10:01:52.256510,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Nate Wessel &amp; Steven Farber,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/citation/,hzgpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s5k3b/,s5k3b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1858f6d54ad3001cd5eff8/,5c1858f6d54ad3001cd5eff8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hzgpd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hzgpd,NA

At the heart of this transformation was the rise of the state; a politically centralized territorial polity with an internally specialized administrative organization. But what drove the emergence and evolution of specialized governance is broadly contested. Here we use Seshat: Global History Databank to empirically test predictions from a variety of theories. One set of explanations proposes social scale (polity population and territory, population of the largest settlement) as the primary factor favoring the evolution of specialized governance institutions. Other theories focus on alternative mechanisms, such as social stratification or the provisioning of public goods. Still others point to the importance of sophisticated information and money systems as potential preconditions for the evolution of bureaucracy. Our analysis identifies polity population size as the main evolutionary driver of state-formation. Although information systems also play a role, stratification has no detectable impact, once polity population is included in the model; and, while territorial expansion may be a key factor in the emergence of certain first-generation or primary states, the territorial extent of polities actually has a negative effect on the evolution of sophisticated governance, once polity population is included in the model.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Evolution|Political Centralization|Seshat Databank|Social Complexity|State Formation|Statistical Analysis,2018-12-17T18:52:03.484868,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-17T18:50:39.610597,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/citation/,h7tr6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cx463/,cx463,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1690027b16bf0019ad1936/,5c1690027b16bf0019ad1936,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h7tr6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h7tr6,NA

The point of departure of my argument is the Ili-
Wawas Integrated Project, a combined logging and agricultural project which seeks to bring economic development to the remote Pomio district of East New 
Britain Province by connecting existing logging roads to the limited national road network around the provincial capital. Developing the national road network and creating standardized or—to use James Scott’s concept—legible environments can be seen as an integral part of state-making and strengthening the role of the state. In addition to the environment, the state also needs to 
make social life legible in forms of maps, censuses and laws. As I will argue in my paper, the Ili-Wawas, and other similar projects, may indeed strengthen the role of the state not only by creating the infrastructure and legibility needed by the state, but also in unintended and accidental ways. The side effects of logging and road building include, among others, fear of crime and land disputes. It is these that create among the locals a perceived need for state institutions, which may be as significant in advancing the role of the state as is the creation of infrastructure and legibility.",TRUE,FALSE,development|land dispute|legibility|neoliberalism|Papua New Guinea|road building|state,2018-12-16T15:21:05.662148,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-16T15:20:46.048020,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/citation/,fxyh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gmwht/,gmwht,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1654dce979520017e377cd/,5c1654dce979520017e377cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxyh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxyh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxyh7,NA

By contributing to state formation in this way, the inhabitants of Pomio also make claims on what the state should be like. While plantations become governable and statelike spaces, they do not produce simply governable subjects, nor do they produce a uniformly governable territory but an uneven space in which some places are more governable than others.

The answer to this question may shed some light on two widely debated issues: (1) Is cultural capital essentially an instrument of exclusion adopted by economic-based classes, with the status dimension of social stratification being an epiphenomenon of class structure? (2) Is cultural participation governed by strategic status-seeking? This paper argues that possible combinations of answers to these questions suggest three different scenarios of reactions to the loosening of links between distribution of cultural and economic capital: “meltdown” (the failure of high culture to mark boundaries of an economically privileged group results in a considerable decline in cultural participation, particularly among younger individuals (DiMaggio and Mukhtar, 2004), “transfer” (status culture being taken over by the descendants of the new economically advantaged groups), and “permanence” (no significant change occurs). In this paper, we analyse a unique database which allows tracing arts participation rates by major categories of consumers in Saint Petersburg, Russia, between 1991 and 2017—the period of the emergence of capitalism, also widely regarded as the time of economic decline of the traditional Soviet intelligentsia.

As a result, a political divide opened up so that by 2010 conservatives had the lowest level of confidence in science. This analysis extends the trends through the 2018 General Social Survey (GSS). I find that political conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who attend religious services regularly, all report falling levels of confidence in the scientific community. Further, for the period 2012-2018, educational attainment, for conservatives, is not associated with increased levels of confidence in science, except at the graduate degree level (and even there confidence is lower among conservatives). In the Trump era, with an assault on facts and truth defining the president and his party, the growing political divide over confidence in science seems likely to further undermine political processes that rely on common knowledge and understanding.
