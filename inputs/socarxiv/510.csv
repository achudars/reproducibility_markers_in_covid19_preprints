I describe my public work  2000 to 2009 on racial disparities in imprisonment which has included descriptive data analysis with graphical presentations, over 75 public presentations, and participation in multiple groups and commissions. My work does not fit neatly into any of the four boxes in Burowoy's 2x2 classification of types of sociology as professional, critical, policy, or public. I began the work ""as a person"" who became concerned about the issue, not ""as a sociologist."" In the first section I tell the story of how I got drawn into the issue by the efforts of community activists. I had critical concerns about the issue that brought different questions to the table than animated professional criminology,  but was not was concerned about criticizing sociology per se. In the second section, I stress that my special contribution was to bring professional skills in data analysis and presentation to the table in the service of a public purpose, and I argue that activist community often need these professional skills. In the third section I discuss the ways in which I have actively engaged with many different types of groups (grassroots activists, professional reformers, community groups) and talk about the ways in which these groups differ and, especially, the racial dynamics of different groups. I attempted to play a bridging role of bringing the discourses from one group (e.g. Black community members) into dialog with the discourses from other groups (e.g. police). In the fourth section, I critique Burowoy's distinction between public and policy sociology and talk about the real politics and racial dynamics of the different real groups I worked with. I stress that pointing to problems is much easier than figuring out how to solve them. In the conclusion I reflect on the ways in which my work may have had influence.",TRUE,FALSE,public sociology,2018-07-02T11:55:44.805825,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-11T16:09:51.408707,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology,Rowman and Littlefield,2009,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/citation/,cg6hp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7p6rk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/relationships/node/,7p6rk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1ae7e3b796ba00103f454e/,5b1ae7e3b796ba00103f454e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cg6hp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cg6hp

This is a case study of my racial disparities work that overlaps somewhat with other presentations I have made of the same material. My work has involved doing descriptive statistical analyses of racial patterns of imprisonment and making public presentations on these patterns, as participating in many meetings of boards and committees working on these issues.  Part 1 of this article describes the background of my work and how I got involved, partly through connections with community groups and partly through luck. Part 2 describes my public engagement, including giving talks and participating in many meetings as well as doing analyses at the request of community groups.

Providing Useful Knowledge, Becoming Embedded: Issues and Tensions as a Racial Justice Ally. Plenary presentation at the 2011 Conference of the Collective Behavior and Social Movements Section of the American Sociological Association. 


This informal essay based on my experiences working with community groups around issues of racial disparities in criminal justice addresses three topics: (1) What kinds of knowledge are useful and how sociologists can contribute to producing useful knowledge. Here I emphasize that movements typically have a great need for information about the issue and less need for information about how to be an activist. I stress the value of professional skills for producing this knowledge and the problems in making knowledge accessible. (2) The general problem of class and expertise and the interplay of race and class hierarchies in creating knowledge within movements with special attention to the role of sociologists. In this section I stress the importance of listening to the knowledge people have about their own experiences and circumstances and bringing this knowledge into dialog with ""professional"" knowledge. I also discuss the real tensions and conflicts that arise in mixed-race and mixed-class groups. (3) The generic problem of opportunism and conflicts of interest and perspective and how sociologists fit into these problems. In developing these arguments I draw on longstanding discussions of tensions and conflicts between beneficiary constituents. I also advance the concept of an activist professional, a person whose activism is closely related to or intertwined with their job, and make the point that activist professionals often experience tensions and conflicts of interest between advancing the movement and advancing (or at least not jeopardizing) their careers. I discuss the ways in which Black activist professionals had a different standpoint from White activist professionals around the racial disparity issue because they saw themselves as part of the beneficiary group. I argue that academics in movements are typically conscience constituents and activist professionals and that academics who seek to work with and provide useful knowledge to movements should be aware of  these tensions and conflicts. I conclude by honoring the efforts and commitments of the people I have met in the movement and emphasize how much harder it is to find solutions to problems than to identify problems.",TRUE,FALSE,activism|activist professionals|public sociology,2018-07-02T11:55:44.360031,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-08T17:40:27.467265,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/citation/,km72c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6fmcb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/relationships/node/,6fmcb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1abcd1ec24e20010b616ac/,5b1abcd1ec24e20010b616ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/km72c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/km72c

This study proposes to use the decomposition method to divide the problem of foot-orienteering into sub-parts and use the special quantitative methods to solve specific sub-problems. Experiments results show that the proficiency of the participants’ sub-skills is increasing. All participants took part in the Orienteering Competition of the National Student, and the team performance increased by nearly 13% and the proportion of the normal athletes who gain the ranking was increased from 0% to 60%. The results of this study demonstrate that applying the decomposition method and the above training methods are effective and reasonable, it also offers a useful solution for coaches to operate training and quantify easily.",TRUE,FALSE,Arithmetic Mean Running|Bleep Test in Plum-blossom|Bleep Test with Legend|decomposition method|deep thinking sport,2018-07-02T11:55:42.408430,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-08T10:58:09.118038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d51|Education|Outdoor Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/citation/,mjreh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b6zta/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/relationships/node/,b6zta,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b19dea7b796ba000f3e7e0f/,5b19dea7b796ba000f3e7e0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjreh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mjreh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mjreh

Drawing upon two formative theories from communication and psychology: self-construal and signaling theory, we examine the likelihood that users will change their profiles and what constitutes a significant profile change. Our findings indicate that users are more likely to change their Profile Summaries and Display Names than their Locations and Screen Names (i.e. handles). Further, we used topic modeling to partition users based on their profiles to identify themes and explored how profile changes differ among these thematic groups (e.g., Trump supporters). Last, we identified the most significant word changes by users in their profiles.

This mixed-methods studies uses student interviews, survey responses, and MOOC log data to examine the experience of students participating in an edX MicroMasters in a private university in the Northeastern United States. We found that the program attracted a cohort of mid-career professionals, largely in developed countries, who were seeking to enhance their skills in order to advance their careers. Successful students were more likely to be more motivated by “mastery” goals, focusing on gaining new skills and knowledge, than “performance” goals such as grades or credentials and many students who earned a credential said they did not think the credential by itself would help them advance their careers.
