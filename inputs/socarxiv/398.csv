A total of 87,997,893 documents were obtained, of which 95,304 (0.10%) were in the category of “communication.” In average, 4.24% of the documents in all 184 categories were open access. While in communication, it was 3.29%, which ranked communication 116 out of 184. An Open Access Index (OAI) was developed to predict the trend of open access in communication. Based on the OAI, communication needs 77 years to fully reach open access, which undeniably can be considered as “crisis in scientific publishing” in this field. Given this stunning information, it is the time for a global call for “open access” by communication scholars across the world.

And in my point of view, tomb of King Qa’a resembles a particular burial system – “Huangchangticou”(黄肠题凑). Since human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups O be found in Egypt, but no in the others in the image in the paper, I speculate that there must be a “indigenous people” in the Liangzhu area to return to Egypt with the fleet. From the paper , I speculate that the eagle in a statue of a man, dating from Yue State (越国) and the eagles in Fanshan Cemetery and Yaoshan Hill, the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City (良渚古城遗址反山墓地和瑶山), resemble the God Horus in Egypt. I can also get a conclusion that Zhejiang(浙江)(including Yuhang(余杭)and Shaoxing(绍兴)) was once Egypt’s colony. From the paper, I can get a conclusion that Mojiaoshan Terrace (莫角山台地) resembles the Ziggurat of Ur and Anu Ziggurat, Uruk (modern Warka) in function and shape. In my point of view, Narmer's tomb in Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos in Upper Egypt is a cenotaph of his. And from the paper, I can conclude that the “grass-wrapped silt” discovered by Liangzhu archaeologists in Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City has the same shape, size and use of building materials as the mud bricks used in the construction of cities, palaces and tombs during Narmer’s period of ancient Egypt, so I can conclude that the territory of Liangzhu culture (including Yuhang(余杭)and Shaoxing(绍兴)) was once Egypt’s colony. From the paper, I can find the prototype of the square-shape (the shape of ""Hui""(回), a Chinese character) altars on Mt. Yaoshan and Mt. Huiguanshan from Dendera zodiac. From the paper, I can conclude that the divine emblem unearthed from Tomb M12, Fanshan cemetery indicates that the owner of the tomb was probably the governor of ancient Egypt. Since Fanshan (反山) is an artificially piled up mastaba shape like mound and it is larger than any other tombs of mastabas of the kings in ancient Egypt, I can get a hypothesis that Yu (Narmer) died while on a hunting tour to the eastern frontier of his empire, and chose Fanshan (反山) as his tomb at first , but for some unknown reasons, he buried in Yu mausoleum (大禹陵) ,  Mount Kuaiji (会稽山) , south of present-day Shaoxing (绍兴).",TRUE,FALSE,Anu Ziggurat|Dendera zodiac|divine emblem|Fanshan (反山)|governor of ancient Egypt|grass-wrapped silt|Horus|Huangchangticou(黄肠题凑)|mastaba|Mojiaoshan Terrace|mud bricks|Narmer|square-shape altars|Uruk|Yu mausoleum (大禹陵)|Yu (禹)|Ziggurat of Ur,2019-08-28T20:54:25.351548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-28T20:53:58.828076,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce5|Arts and Humanities|History|Other History,"Bohai,Xu",2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/citation/,gbhvf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d650c392a8cc000163d47c8/,5d650c392a8cc000163d47c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gbhvf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gbhvf

Ego network data remain a popular choice, despite the growing availability of full networks from automated sources (such as cell phone records). This is in large part because ego network data are easy to collect but still provide a surprisingly large amount of network information. Ego network data are also quite flexible, with past work using the same basic data structure for widely different purposes: from measuring social support and social boundaries; to inferring global network features from a sample; to acting as a corrective for other sampling techniques (such as respondent-driven sampling). Ego network data are thus easy to collect and useful for a wide variety of substantive and methodological problems.

It is a key element in almost every commercial transaction over time and might be one of the main explanations of economic success and development. In Europe, the determinants of (generalized) trust have been investigated in the past. Most scholars have focused on aggregate (national) levels of trust. However, it can be assumed that driving forces, which foster or diminish trust, act at a sub-national level. Regional clusters remain undetected. With the use of the European Social Survey 6 and modern spatial diagnostics, this work examines the individual and regional determinants of trust in 88 European NUTS1 regions in 26 countries. There are two main findings. First, wealth, linguistic fragmentation, and religious ideologies shape trust on a regional level, education, income, and membership in associations foster trust on an individual level. Secondly, the study unravels regional dispersions in different types of ""trust regimes"" in Europe. Regional clusters of generalized trust are confirmed by spatial diagnostics.

Rather, powerful actors in these institutions determine the worthiness of candidates by evaluating whether those candidates engage in the work and social life of the institution. Those evaluations are shaped by race and social class distinctions, and perceptions of engagement are important for the candidate’s future successes.

The apparent lack of literature regarding the Aetas’ view on Usog and the health implications of this phenomenon prompted the researchers to explore the concept of Usog among the Aetas of Nabuclod, Pampanga. In this qualitative study, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data from the respondents. Purposive sampling was used in the selection of subjects and informed consent was sought. Following the individual interviews with five different Aeta families, thematic analysis was done so as to identify the common emerging concept of Usog. It was found that the Aetas of Nabuclod see Usog as a transmittable mystical force primarily inflicted by humans and not by spirits. This force is said to be transferred unintentionally through eye or physical contact. Similarly, this usually affects infants, with crying fits as the most common symptom. The Aetas’ primary treatment for Usog was the use of Amyong as incense or decoction.

The first part of the paper gives a brief background on the philosophers and their philosophies focusing on Descartes' Dualism then comparing it to Ricouer's concept of “Selfhood”. Meanwhile, the second part of this paper deals with how these two philosophies affect our understanding of the metaparadigm in nursing (Fawcett, 1984) specifically, the concept of person, health, environment, and nursing",TRUE,FALSE,Descartes|metaparadigm|mind-body|nursing|philosophy|Ricouer,2019-08-25T12:33:05.834147,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-25T12:32:43.090027,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/citation/,yd4nu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d624188e4727b00182a2fd6/,5d624188e4727b00182a2fd6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yd4nu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yd4nu/,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2445241,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yd4nu

An Empirical Investigation on Europe's Regional Social Capital,"Aiming to explain the European divide with respect to social and political values, scholars in the past have relied on a simplified four- (or even two-) dimensional regime model which tranches the continent according to the social capacities of its inhabitants. This ""cartography"" of ""Social Europe"" proves to be outdated by the results presented in this study which re-measures the social capital landscape in Europe. In this work, we apply a factor analysis model to the most commonly used approximations of social capital on the European Social Survey.
In addition, we explore, as a novelty in social capital literature, a classification tree to model generalized trust. The analysis shows that three distinct dimensions of social capital measures are important in Europe: additionally to generalised social capital, which is usually approximated by generalised trust, there is one dimension of civic engagement and one of communitarian values. This distinction leads to a new social landscape of Europe, which highlights the relevance of considering regional and cross-border clusters in all relevant social capital dimensions.The results of the non-parametric model reveal that Protestantism and education are good benchmarks to classify trust on an individual level. Based on these findings we argue for the necessity of policies with a regional focus that take the different sub-national structures of social capacity in Europe into account. We re-measure the European Social Capital landscape using current data and provide a novel non-parametrical statistical method from data science for this purpose.",TRUE,FALSE,Classification trees|Factor Analysis|Multi-level model|Social Capital,2019-08-25T03:11:02.817084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-25T03:10:30.388778,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/citation/,esgra,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6198988f8fe5001615a2a8/,5d6198988f8fe5001615a2a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgra/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/esgra/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/esgra
