We then apply this perspective to two crucial cases, showing how and why the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank advocated and actively promoted, for monetary policy purposes, the development of shadow banking and shadow money.

We tested the effect of environmental attitudes on behavior in an online experiment with real money at stake and real-world consequences.

Academic and popular discussions of populism frequently suggest that this is the case, and that anger and anxiety in particular, are crucial explanatory factors for the continued appeal of populist parties.  But despite the often-posited link between negative emotions and populism, few studies have explored this relationship empirically.  
This paper aims to fill this gap and answer three related questions: Firstly, to what extent is the relationship between negative affect and populist party support unique to these parties and do we observe differences between left and right-wing populism? Secondly, what is the temporal relationship between affect and populism?  Do voters support populist parties because they are anxious or does support for these parties create these negative emotions? And finally, are populists angry, scared, or both? In other words, to what extent do we need to distinguish between specific types of negative affect, such as anger and anxiety, when discussing the emotional underpinnings of populism? 
Comparing panel data from Austria and Germany, this paper investigates the relationship between anger and anxiety on the one hand, and support for populist parties on the other. Using a random-intercept, autoregressive cross-lagged design, the paper has three findings. 
First of all, the reinforcing pattern of increased negative emotions and increased party support is unique to (right-wing) populists. Secondly, this relationship is self-reinforcing. While negative affect leads to greater support for right wing populist parties, the reverse relationship is more consistent and of larger magnitude.  Negative emotions trigger populist support, but they are more important for maintaining it. Finally, it is important to distinguish between anger and anxiety. While only anxiety is consistent in its ability to trigger populist support, subsequently both anger and anxiety are increased.",TRUE,FALSE,AfD|Anger|Anxiety|Austria|Emotions|FPO|Germany|Panel Models|Populism,2019-03-13T13:27:41.589091,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-13T13:26:58.837375,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/citation/,e2wm6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6mh82/,6mh82,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c88928266b44d001b789ea1/,5c88928266b44d001b789ea1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2wm6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2wm6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2wm6,NA

Nonetheless, by standard classification metrics the discipline seems to have made little progress. Although some remedy is promised by particular cross-validation strategies and machine learning tools, which increase accuracy rates substantively, predictions over time remain challenging. In this research note we provide evidence that the predictive performance of conflict models is plagued by temporal residual error. We demonstrate that standard classification metrics for binary outcome data are prone to underestimate model performance in a Binary-Time-Series-Cross-Section context when temporal prediction error is high. We approach this problem as a Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem and propose to evaluate the predictive performance of this type of model in differently sized temporal windows. While retaining the ability of models to leverage disaggregated data for prediction, we provide a parsimonious aggregation approach that allows researchers to evaluate the time frame in which predictive models perform best.

Studying children’s time use cross-nationally provides new understandings of the micro-macro drivers of children’s daily activities with critical implications for their personal development, future lifestyles and identity formation. The study uses rich time-diary data from 2008-2015 for a pooled sample of children aged 10-17 from Finland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (N = 6,556), applying multiple linear regression models addressing (i) between-country and (ii) within-country variations. Findings are consistent with the Cross-Cultural Hypothesis by revealing that Finnish children spend the lowest time with parents and the highest time alone and with ‘others’, after accounting for multiple factors. In Italy and Spain, children’s time with parents is the highest, and time alone and with others clearly lowest. The UK lies somewhere in between the Scandinavian and Mediterranean models. In ‘family-oriented’ Italy and Spain, children spend more time eating (i.e., having dinners), while in more ‘individualistic’ Finland and UK screen-based time is highest (i.e. mobile phone use). The Structural Opportunities Hypothesis receives little support. Parental education generally leads to more time in educational activities in all four countries, while maternal employment generally weakly predicts children’s time use across activities and national contexts. Overall, the strong cross-national differences observed in child and adolescent time use do not seem driven by simple structural or socioeconomic opportunity contexts, but rather by cross-cultural differences in values around family relations and individuals’ daily routines.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-13T13:29:08.486141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-13T13:27:46.036535,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/citation/,ks6vg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c883d741d73810019c0c59d/,5c883d741d73810019c0c59d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks6vg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ks6vg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ks6vg,NA

Drawing on data from historical archives, original interviews, and ethnography, I examine two cases—one rural and one urban—of boom and bust in a now-defunct, Midwestern iron and steel commodity chain. From this data, I ask how and why natural resources remain ideologically and economically central to post-industrial communities. I demonstrate how the mobility of capital reproduces environmental, economic, and social inequalities.
This project revises our understanding of natural resource commodification by probing the tensions between the political economies of industrial capitalism and the place-based nature of social life. Specifically, I argue that post-deindustrialization, the commodification of nature continues to shape land use, infrastructures, and residents’ imaginaries of community identity and economic development. My argument is as follows. First, I draw on historical data to demonstrate how natural resource capitalism not only takes place, but it makes place. I show how the historical political economies of land use constructed persistent infrastructures and ideologies in the communities central to my study. Contemporary interviews reveal how long-term residents contemplate the past as they narrate their identities, reasons for staying, and ideal futures in their de-industrialized communities. Finally, I interrogate contemporary conflicts between possible revivals of industry and a new generation of tourism built on other “natural resources.” This project sheds light on why certain communities continue to center their identities, economic prospects, and perceptions of nature around the concept of natural resources, and offers wide-reaching implications concerning addressing structural and cultural components of human-environment decision-making.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-13T13:31:48.086466,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-13T13:30:26.391818,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/citation/,dhg54,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c86e02666b44d001c742015/,5c86e02666b44d001c742015,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dhg54/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dhg54,NA

In 2012, the question was changed with the inclusion of an additional response option describing uncertainty about pregnancy desire prior to the pregnancy. This analysis investigates how this additional response option affected women’s responses.
Methods: We use the change in the pregnancy intention question in 2012 as a natural experiment, taking advantage of relatively stable distributions of pregnancy intentions over short periods of time within states. Using PRAMS data from 2009-2014 (N=222,781), we employ a regression discontinuity design to test for differences in the proportion of women choosing each response option in the periods pre- and post-question change. 
Results: In the years 2012-2014, 13-15% of women chose the new answer option, “I wasn’t sure what I wanted”. The addition had a substantial impact on distributions of pregnancy intentions, drawing responses away from all answer choices except for “I wanted to become pregnant then.” Effects were not uniform across age, parity and race combined with Hispanic ethnicity, as well as across states.
Conclusions: These effects could impact estimated levels and trends of the proportion of births that are characterized as intended, mistimed or unwanted, as well as estimates of differences between demographic groups. These findings will help to inform new strategies for measuring women’s pregnancy and childbearing desires.",TRUE,FALSE,PRAMS|Pregnancy Intentions|Public Health|Question wording|Surveillance,2019-03-12T10:45:43.838485,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-12T10:45:11.523913,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/citation/,t6pqr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x8r7v/,x8r7v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c86acf11d73810017c2f0d2/,5c86acf11d73810017c2f0d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t6pqr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t6pqr,NA

We provide a new actor-centric approach to explicitly model strategic interdependence in multi-actor civil wars. We argue that competitive dynamics dominate strategic behavior between rebel organizations, but these can be offset by incentives to free-ride in cases where the underlying incompatibility displays public good characteristics. Based on a network game theoretic model, we derive a statistical framework that allows for a direct test of strategic interdependence. We find that the estimated duration interdependence is positive, that is weaker in secessionist conflicts, and that modeling this interdependence explicitly outweighs existing empirical measures of interdependence (e.g. number of organizations). Finally, we demonstrate that the model fit of rebel organizations' fighting durations can be improved by taking strategic interdependence into account.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|duration|network analysis|rebel organizations,2019-03-11T17:35:47.316784,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-11T17:35:16.991952,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/citation/,gz7xb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/65vp7/,65vp7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8677451d7381001ac04780/,5c8677451d7381001ac04780,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gz7xb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gz7xb,NA
