The eco-mom theory—the belief that women have greater environmental concern than men because mothers primarily care about the health and safety of their children, while fathers primarily care about the economic support of their household—is often proffered as an explanation for this difference. Researchers who have previously tested the eco-mom theory have narrowly operationalized parenthood; we are skeptical of this theory and believe it needs additional testing. We look at fertility in relation to concern for climate change using the 2010 General Social Survey. Modeling parenthood like previous studies, we find no differences in concern for climate change between women who have children and those who do not. Modeling fertility, we find that having more children is associated with less concern for climate change for women but not men. Additionally, we find no gender difference in concern for climate change for those with many children, but these findings are complicated by education. Overall, we refute the eco-mom theory and call for new climate change survey data that better capture gender roles and identity as well as more qualitative inquiries into public concern for climate change.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|eco-mom theory|environmental concern|gender|social roles theory,2019-06-05T03:18:29.818616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-05T03:17:55.260068,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/citation/,5t4mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5594ed987b5001688f180/,5cf5594ed987b5001688f180,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5t4mf/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496519852691,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5t4mf

Clemens offers a smart primer on political sociology that asks what is distinct about this sub-field. By surveying its main concepts and research agendas—power and politics, states, nation-states, social movements, social change, and transnationalism—she shows how political sociology examines social processes that influence both formal politics and the politics that take place in everyday settings. Clemens notes that that political sociology differs from political science in that the former studies politics in various settings and that patterns of political participation and the distribution of political power are shaped by social relations, while the latter studies “the formal institutions and acts of governing” (p.1).",TRUE,FALSE,Political Sociology|Social Cage|Social Closure,2019-06-05T03:16:50.396506,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-05T03:16:29.165913,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Nga Than,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/citation/,c6rvq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf509622a50c4001789bd10/,5cf509622a50c4001789bd10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c6rvq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c6rvq

More than 5.7 million in total, Obama-to-Trump voters were essential to Trump’s victory in the Electoral College.  They were more likely to be white, working class, and resident in the Midwest.  They had lower levels of political interest, were centrist in both party affiliation and ideology, and were late deciders for the 2016 election.  On economic interests, they were centrists, except for trade policy, which they viewed, on average, as a greater threat than other voters.  They claimed to have more experience with economic vulnerability than Democratic loyalists of comparable social standing.  On racial attitudes, including the racialized economic topic of immigration, they had a profile similar to Republican loyalists.  While their support of Trump may be attributable to surging white nativism, this article argues for an alternative explanation.

Using data on lung obstruction from the WHO Survey of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE 2007-08), this paper studies the determinants of respiratory health in India, home to a third of all deaths from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. First, we find that smokers and members of households that use solid fuels (wood, biomass, coal or dung) for cooking have higher lung obstruction. Second, even if a respondent's household uses clean fuels, their lung obstruction is higher if their neighbors use solid fuels. In neighborhoods with high solid fuel use, the lungs of members of households that use clean fuels can be as obstructed as lungs of members of households that use solid fuels. These negative externalities of solid fuel use are robust to additional controls for neighborhood socioeconomic status, falsification tests, tests with placebo measures, and tests using alternative measures of respiratory health as outcomes. Third, the influence of the determinants is patterned by gender. Smoking tobacco is an important influence on lung obstruction among men. Confirming non-linear dose-response relationships, we find that women from households that use solid fuels are the only group not further harmed by neighborhood solid fuel smoke, possibly because of high exposure to pollutants while cooking. The study improves our understanding of behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of respiratory health in India.

This study develops a simulation model that incorporates two of the ways that ideas can change as they spread from person to person.  First, ideas can be misinterpreted, or repeated to another person with error.  Second, people can generate new ideas by recombining two schemas, meaning two frameworks for ideas that they already know.  To simulate this, I seed a population with a set of 3 bit idea frameworks, which I refer to as schemas, and then simulate communication by letting a person draw a 5 bit string from the 3 bit schema, or by creatively recombining 2 3-bit frameworks into a 5 bit string.  The recipient of the 5-bit string matches the received string to the set of schemas that he or she already knows.  If he or she receives several bits that cannot be matched to an existing schema, he or she creates a new one.  To explore the parameter space, I vary the probability with which people draw from a single schema versus combining two existing schemas.  The results of this simulation suggest, paradoxically, that creatively recombining schemas leads to less diverse outcomes, and that some ideas are more likely to stick than others.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-01T00:33:46.958504,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-01T00:33:21.941903,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/citation/,85ez6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf1c3e623fec4001ae8ef50/,5cf1c3e623fec4001ae8ef50,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/85ez6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/85ez6

The Effect of Mohamed Salah on Islamophobic Behaviors and Attitudes,"Can exposure to celebrities from a stigmatized group reduce prejudice toward that group writ large? We estimate the causal effect of Mohammed Salah—a visibly Muslim soccer player— joining Liverpool Football Club on Islamophobia, using hate crime reports throughout England, 15 million tweets from British soccer fans, and a survey experiment of Liverpool F.C. fans. We find that hate crimes in Merseyside (home to Liverpool F.C.) dropped by 16% compared to a synthetic control, and Liverpool F.C. fans halved their rates of posting anti-Muslim tweets relative to fans of other top-flight clubs. Our survey experiment suggests that the salience of Salah’s Muslim identity enabled positive feelings toward Salah to generalize to Muslims more broadly. Providing real- world behavioral measures of prejudice reduction and experimental evidence from a naturalistic setting, our findings provide support for the parasocial contact hypothesis, indicating that positive exposure to outgroup celebrities can reduce prejudice.",TRUE,FALSE,hate crimes|intergroup contact|migration|prejudice,2019-05-31T09:16:06.898831,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-31T09:15:46.945107,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://osf.io/fxrmh,prereg_analysis,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/citation/,eq8ca,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf0cc9d2a50c4001786cc34/,5cf0cc9d2a50c4001786cc34,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq8ca/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eq8ca/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eq8ca
