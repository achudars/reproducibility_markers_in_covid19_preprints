A standard that is hard to meet. Being light-skinned, blonde and blue-eyed is the benchmark of beauty, of what is most desirable. But is that really what it takes to be attractive in America? This research examines the relationship between race, birth-place, ethnicity and self-rated attractiveness. The General Social Survey (2016) provides the quantitative data for this study. While past literature explores the connections between identity, self-esteem, and attractiveness, it does not explore the intersection of different identifying characteristics. Group position and Colourism approaches provide the theoretical foundations for the hypothesis and the research conducted in this paper. These theories also help explain why certain physical attributes are more valuable in American society. So how does the privileging of White America, specifically when measuring beauty, influence one’s opinion of their own attractiveness? This study has 1,622 respondents—non-institutionalized, English or Spanish speaking adults, who live in the country. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the individual and collaborative relationships between the variables. The results from this study concur with some of findings from the literature. Yet, they do not support the hypotheses. The results concluded that being Non-White had little influence on one's self-rated attractiveness. Similarly, birthplace and ethnicity had no statistical significance. However, the controls, age and sex, are significant. This research explores the role identity plays in one’s view of their own beauty.

The study draws on resource dilution theory and additionally discusses potentially wealth-enhancing consequences of having siblings. Data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP, N=3,502 individuals) are used to estimate multilevel regression models adjusted for parental wealth and other important confounders neglected in extant work. The main results of the current study show that additional siblings reduce wealth by about 27 to 39 percent. Parental wealth moderates the association so that sibship size is more negatively associated with filial wealth when parents are wealthier. Birth order position does not moderate the association between sibship size and wealth.

Using cumulative inequality theory, which posits that the disadvantage or advantage associated with one’s social location impacts life trajectory and perceptions of such, I propose that level of optimistic outlook in individuals from low-income backgrounds increases their chances of financial success in adulthood. Analyzing data from the 2016 General Social Survey, a nationally representative survey administered to randomly sampled adults in the U.S., I examine a subset of 1,269 individuals from backgrounds of far below average or below average family income levels. In doing so, I determine how optimistic attitudes, regarding matters such as personal agency and success, influence whether the individual may obtain a higher degree of financial success in adulthood compared to those of their families. Findings indicate that higher levels of optimism are associated with greater family income levels, with level of education and marital status as the biggest predictors of adult financial standing. With higher educational attainment, optimistic outlook increases, perhaps due to an increase in career opportunities and pathways to success. These findings show how influential education may be on intergenerational income mobility, however, they also provide insight on how disadvantage, including being a person of color; being divorced, separated or a single-parent; as well as how many children one has, may create limitations on educational attainment and effects on outlook.

This in turn requires trans-disciplinary methodologies for product development that can leverage the existing knowledge in both Ayurveda and modern science and technology. Product Development in general has two steps, research and development (R&amp;D) and manufacturing. Among the two, unlike in allopathic drugs, R&amp;D in Ayurveda for new product development is in its nascent stage, lacking adequate references on modern methodologies. Such references are important in particular to new comers in the sector. The scope of this paper is to provide a write-up of the Ayurvedic processes and to propose a guideline for Ayurvedic product development that can be used for R&amp;D. The methodology proposed was arrived at by referring selected classical Ayurveda texts and interacting with traditional and modern bio-medicine experts at the Trans-disciplinary University, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. The study documents three components in Ayurvedic product development namely product formulation-identification, product formulation-preparation and product formulation-validation which can be used to design the Ayurvedic product development methodology.

We use archived Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data from four North American transit agencies to produce a detailed reconstruction of actual transit vehicle movements over the course of five days in a format that allows for travel time estimation directly comparable to schedule-based GTFS. With travel times estimated on both schedule-based and retrospective networks, we compute and compare a variety of accessibility measures. We find that origin-based accessibility even when averaged over one-hour periods can vary widely between locations. Origins with lower scheduled access tend to produce less reliable estimates with more variability from hour to hour in real accessibility, while higher access zones seem to converge on an estimate 5-15\% lower than the schedule predicts. Such over- and under-predictions exhibit strong spatial patterns which should be of concern to those using accessibility metrics in statistical models. Momentary measures of accessibility are briefly discussed and found to be weakly related to momentary changes in real access. These findings bring into question the validity of some recent applications of GTFS data and point the way toward more robust methods for calculating accessibility.",TRUE,FALSE,access|accessibility|General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS|Jacksonville Transportation Authority|MBTA|opentripplanner|public transport|SF Muni|Toronto|Toronto Transit Commission|transit|TTC,2018-12-18T10:02:21.536980,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-18T10:01:52.256510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Nate Wessel &amp; Steven Farber,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/citation/,hzgpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s5k3b/,s5k3b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1858f6d54ad3001cd5eff8/,5c1858f6d54ad3001cd5eff8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hzgpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hzgpd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hzgpd,NA
h7tr6,preprints,2018-12-16T17:48:46.332453,2020-06-18T12:22:35.590242,2018-12-17T18:50:39.610597,2018-12-16T05:00:00,NA,Evolutionary Pathways to Statehood: Old Theories and New Data,"Over the past 10,000 years, human societies evolved from “simple”—small egalitarian groups, integrated by face-to-face interactions—to “complex”— societies of millions, characterized by great differentials in wealth, status, and power, extensive division of labor, and elaborate governance structures. At the heart of this transformation was the rise of the state; a politically centralized territorial polity with an internally specialized administrative organization. But what drove the emergence and evolution of specialized governance is broadly contested. Here we use Seshat: Global History Databank to empirically test predictions from a variety of theories. One set of explanations proposes social scale (polity population and territory, population of the largest settlement) as the primary factor favoring the evolution of specialized governance institutions. Other theories focus on alternative mechanisms, such as social stratification or the provisioning of public goods. Still others point to the importance of sophisticated information and money systems as potential preconditions for the evolution of bureaucracy. Our analysis identifies polity population size as the main evolutionary driver of state-formation. Although information systems also play a role, stratification has no detectable impact, once polity population is included in the model; and, while territorial expansion may be a key factor in the emergence of certain first-generation or primary states, the territorial extent of polities actually has a negative effect on the evolution of sophisticated governance, once polity population is included in the model.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Evolution|Political Centralization|Seshat Databank|Social Complexity|State Formation|Statistical Analysis,2018-12-17T18:52:03.484868,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-17T18:50:39.610597,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/citation/,h7tr6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cx463/,cx463,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1690027b16bf0019ad1936/,5c1690027b16bf0019ad1936,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7tr6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h7tr6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h7tr6,NA
