Previous research shows the generic structure of acknowledgements written by native Persian postgraduate students contains a ‘thanking-God move’, absent in native English speakers’ acknowledgements. In an approximate replication of Hyland’s (2004) study of the generic structure of acknowledgments, we aimed to verify the occurrence, frequency, and variation of moves and steps in three small corpora of acknowledgments from six disciplines (applied linguistics, business management, computer science, electrical engineering, microbial biotechnology, &amp; biochemistry). Each corpus contained 200 sample acknowledgements written in Persian or English. The authors were native Persian speakers and native English speakers. Fifty acknowledgements (100-400 words) were randomly selected from each corpus and analyzed using Hyland’s model. Two coders carefully, content-analyzed, and coded the acknowledgments. Then the data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results confirmed findings of previous research indicating that acknowledgements written by native Persian speakers (in Persian &amp; in English) contain all the moves and steps defined by Hyland plus a new step called ‘thanking-God’ step. The use of this step was significantly different across Persian and English (84% in English &amp; 100% in Persian; X2= 1.63, p≤ 0.05) and across writers (84% Persian &amp; 34% English; X2= 28.17, p≤.05). ‘Accepting responsibility’ and ‘dedicating the thesis’ were used least frequently by all writers, while ‘thanking move’ and ‘reflecting move’ were used most frequently.

The subject has been raised in an English-speaking country milieu (United States of America), while she has been used to speaking Arabic at home. In this regard, the paper highlights the aim of the encoded usage of code-switching utterances in term of addressing the monolingual brain hypothesis. This qualitative study is based on open observations of two continues months of a toddler as the participant of this study aiming at exploring whether children’s greeting differ from those of adults and whether this greeting differs between two languages with regard to monolingual brain hypotheses. So far, the study concluded that greeting has never been mixed upon context, though utterances are code-switched. Moreover, the greeting process is comprehended and acquired within the language context as a pragmatic speech act regarding greeter’s identity, context, and gender. Findings of this study significantly support the cognitive approach in term of greeting via using a high frequent greeting word among the American culture. As would cognitive linguists suggest, greeting speech act response varies regarding how greeters of each community greet the subject, but not how they greet each other’s in a community. Therefore, surprisingly the two-year-old subject perceptually recognizes the fact of receiving two different languages regardless to the monolingual hypothesis.",TRUE,FALSE,Bilingual|case study|code-switched greeting|monolingual brain hypothesis,2019-07-20T21:45:04.662154,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:44:49.357958,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/citation/,kf89q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa59eb2aa0d90019d2a84c/,5caa59eb2aa0d90019d2a84c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kf89q/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.28,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kf89q

This mixed-methods study aimed at examining the effects of the blended learning approach on Jordanian EFL learners’ grammar performance. The study also aimed at investigating the attitudes of Jordanian EFL learners toward blended learning. To achieve the objectives of the study, it employed a quasi-experimental design (pre and posttests) followed by qualitative interviews. The participants were divided into two groups: experimental and control groups. Among the 28 students in the sample, those in the experimental blended learning group (n=13) were taught using Moodle while those in the control group (n=15) were taught using conventional methods. All the 13 participants in the experimental group were interviewed. The results of the posttest revealed that students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control group. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis results showed that blended learning had a positive impact on the learners’ English grammar performance and that they were strongly satisfied and motivated to learn English using similar methods. It is concluded that blended learning could be used as an effective method of teaching English grammar in EFL settings.

A Feasibility Study in Promoting a Saudi-Owned TASL Programme,"Given that teaching Arabic, as a second language has become increasingly significant in the present context, it follows that there is an urgent and pressing need to develop efficient learning tools as well as adequate measuring tools for testing the learner’s development. There are numerous problems associated with measuring a learner’s proficiency in Arabic in the context of Western cultures. These problems are related to the non-adaptability of measuring tools from one setting into another without taking cultural factors into account. The difficulties faced by scholars in adapting Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) tools to the Saudi context is an example. However, the problems associated with such an adaptation indicate the need for context-specific language acquisition measuring tools. Either currently existing tools such as TESOL need to be radically altered to fit Saudi contexts and requirements, or entirely new tools must be created in order to test the efficacy of language learning in Saudi Arabia. This study aims at a close examination of ways in which existing tests such as TESOL may be adapted or modified to suit the requirements of teachers and learners in the Saudi context. A survey and evaluation of existing tools was followed by developing new tools specifically for Arabic language. It concludes by giving recommendations for proposed modification of existing strategies for Arabic learners that associates the language more directly with functional workplace contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic language learning|second language learning|standardised testing|teaching Arabic as a second language (TASL),2019-07-20T21:41:42.456431,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:41:16.683764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/citation/,2q5rd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa57c9641d10001bbf0ec0/,5caa57c9641d10001bbf0ec0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2q5rd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2q5rd

The conveniently selected participants were thirteen ESL learners and a native speaker of English instructor. Two data collection instruments were employed to gather the primary data for this research study. The first instrument was a student survey to explore the perceptions and beliefs of the students about MMCs. The second measure involved a set of semi-structured interviews with four students and their instructor. The results of the statistical data analysis of the student survey indicated that the majority of the student participants expressed their preference for using MMCs because this writing approach enabled them to more completely and professionally explain their meanings to others. The findings from the analysis of the data gathered from the semi structured interviews demonstrated that the students believed that MMCs made writing easier than writing with words only. However, the perception of the teacher was that some students believe that MMCs add an extra burden to their writing assignments and do not constitute an integral part of an assignment itself.

Theoretically speaking, the goal behind such reform is to shift from a content-based to a process-based learning/teaching and thus to make learning more relevant and realistic for students. However, in practice, teachers find difficulties in putting into practice the two approaches. The aim of the present paper is to explore those obstacles that hinder the execution of the PBL approach in the third-year secondary education English classes and to identify to what extent English language teachers master and use PBL methodology in their classes. To reach the aim of the study, the following hypothesis is put forward: teachers lack both training and background knowledge on the approaches that help to implement PBL in classrooms. For the sake of collecting information about the issue tackled in this study, twenty EFL teachers from some secondary schools in Mostaganem city received a questionnaire. The research findings confirm the hypothesis mentioned above. They reveal that teachers neither master nor use the project-based instruction proficiently in their classrooms despite the guidance provided in the third-year pedagogical documents.

One of the most challenging tests faced by Saudi students in their studies, is the summative speaking test. The test is consisting of three tasks in which students required to go through them all. Accordingly, there is a need to seek approaches to enhance students’ performance in the speaking test. In other words, formative assessment has not been used to overcome the challenges faced by the Saudi students at Taibah University in the speaking test. This research aims to investigate whether a formative speaking assessment has a significant impact on students’ performance in the summative test. Also, it aims to monitor student learning and to provide constructive feedback that can be used by teachers to improve students’ learning and help the students to identify their strengths and weaknesses in speaking skills. This study concludes that formative assessment helps Saudi students to overcome the challenges they face in speaking test.

They were divided in to two groups and each group comprised 200 advanced EFL learners. Explicit morphological instructions were given to group two in the classroom for full one semester whereas group one wasn't given any kind of morphological knowledge. To collect data, exactly the same lists of word-formation on different morphological processes and their use in the writing samples were administered to both the groups. The main objective of this research was to examine the correlation between the morphological awareness and the EFL writing after testing learners' reflection on word-formation. Then it also tried to explore the difference between their performances to check whether the morphological instructions improved their writing or not. The findings stated that group two students always performed far better than group one and showed a strong understanding of word-formation structure while applying and manipulating in the morphological-instructed tasks. The formulated hypothesis-the teaching of explicit morphemic rules improves not only morphological awareness to a large extent but also grammatical, intralingual, lexical and syntactic awareness that results to enhance collaboratively EFL writing competence. A promising contribution of this current study to pedagogy was that explicit teaching of morphology improved writing to a concrete, large extent and revealed clearly that it must be introduced to EFL learners from the early education so that their writing skill can be developed effectively.",TRUE,FALSE,derivation|EFL writing|inflection|internal change|Morphological awareness|suppletion,2019-07-20T21:40:04.709820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:39:36.129524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/citation/,s7f5r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa514308a3bf001902ca4c/,5caa514308a3bf001902ca4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s7f5r/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s7f5r

The role of adjectives becomes more and more important with the emergence of computer-mediated communication (СMС). The aim of the present paper is to shed light on the use of adjectives in СMС. It is assumed that adjectives in online comments do not keep the same linguistic structure and function like in spoken English and new forms emerge as the result of using СMС. It analyses adjectives used by non-native English speakers through collecting a corpus of fifty utterances obtained from comments posted publically in Facebook. The results demonstrate that adjectives take different forms by means of combining with non-linguistic forms, and express functions other than just modifying nouns in the narrow sense. Adjectives combine with non-linguistic forms to reinforce their function, and a pragmatic function seen in implying the description.",TRUE,FALSE,Adjectives|CMC|comments|emojis|English|Facebook|function|online|pragmatics,2019-07-20T21:39:42.353101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:39:17.286451,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/citation/,x46bf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa509f08a3bf001a01a354/,5caa509f08a3bf001a01a354,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x46bf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x46bf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.20,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x46bf
