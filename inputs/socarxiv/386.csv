Research on face-to-face service work has shown that these workers are expected to display certain emotions in the course of their work, a phenomenon known as emotional labor. However, little is known about emotional communication among online customer service workers. We explored emotional labor in an online context by examining the degree of emotional presence in mediated service interactions and its relationship with workers’ acting strategies (i.e., surface acting, deep acting). Further, we examined if emotional presence and acting strategies predict job satisfaction as well as burnout. Data collected from 130 online customer service workers indicated that they perceive the highest emotional presence in phone conversations, followed by email and chat. Although there was little relationship between emotional presence and acting strategies, those who engage in surface acting are less satisfied with their job and more likely to experience burnout. In addition, those who feel a higher degree of emotional presence over the phone tend to experience higher job satisfaction and less burnout. These findings suggest that online customer service workers also engage in emotional labor.",TRUE,FALSE,communication studies|computer-mediated communication|customer service|deep acting|emotional labor|emotional presence|online interaction|organizational communication|surface acting,2019-09-21T23:50:43.123675,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-21T23:50:32.520047,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/citation/,qjx5y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/crfu6/,crfu6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8654aab3103d00195129ba/,5d8654aab3103d00195129ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjx5y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qjx5y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qjx5y,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.04.037

This pattern of waning effects could well be the result of selective attrition, since those of modest social origins who make a given transition may have unobserved characteristics, such as cognitive or noncognitive skills, that help them make the next transition, while better off individuals may be less steeply selected on these characteristics. I study a sample of American 10th graders from 1980 to assess how much the pattern of waning effects is due to selective attrition along academic and noncognitive skills for this cohort. I find that controlling for academic skills makes the effect of socioeconomic status more stable across transitions, but controlling for noncognitive skills does not. Socioeconomic advantage does not decline uniformly across transitions, and it appears most pronounced at the transition into college.

Political science also shows signs of reworking itself in response to these crises. Sociology sits on the sidelines. There have not been the same reliability or ethical scandals, at least not in the limelight, nor has there been strong disciplinary moves toward open science. This paper therefore investigates sociology as a discipline looking at current practices, definitions of sociology, positions of sociological associations and a brief consideration of the arguments of three highly influential sociologists: Weber, Merton and Habermas. Based on this disciplinary review, I suggest that sociology is no different from its neighboring disciplines in terms of reliability or ethical dilemmas. Therefore, sociology should adopt open science practices immediately. Weber, Merton and Habermas – three very different social thinkers epistemologically – offer strong arguments that favor what we know as “open science” today. Open science promotes ethics and reliability, reduces fraud and ultimately increases the value of sociology for policymakers and the public.

Online practices of grassroots participation, which used to be considered the prerogative of democratizing forces fighting established powers, turned out to be an effective platform for far-right extremists. In the attempt to make sense of what happened and develop workable solutions, stakeholders rapidly moved through the different stages of grief, ranging from denial to anger and acceptance.

As a case in point, we trace the path through these stages which moved from an initial denial of the problem to concern over “fake news” and hoaxes, to finally focusing on the behavior of certain actors on the platform. Starting from the current phase, we analyze “coordinated inauthentic behavior”, a concept only briefly defined in Facebook public statements which, nevertheless, is useful to frame future studies insofar as both the idea of coordination and authenticity have been studied in the literature. Leveraging these works, we suggest a definition that is at once framed in this literature and easy to operationalize.

Using this definition and an unprecedented combination of CrowdTangle API (a tool for accessing Facebook and other social media data) and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election, we developed a method that led to the identification of several networks of pages/groups/verified public profiles (“entities”) that shared the same political news stories on Facebook within a very short period of time (10 in 2018, composed of 28 entities, and 50 in 2019, composed of 143 entities). We call this behavior “coordinated link sharing”. By analyzing the social media profiles of such coordinated entities, we observed that while some of them were clearly political, others presented themselves as entertainment venues, despite sharing political content too. Since the political news stories shared by these non-political entities can reach a broad audience which is largely unguarded against attempts to influence, we describe their behavior as “inauthentic”.

Further analyses showed that the news shared by the coordinated networks received a Facebook engagement higher than other news included in our dataset, that much news boosted anti-immigration and far-right propaganda and that several of the news outlets shared by these networks were already blacklisted by fact-checkers.",TRUE,FALSE,coordinated inauthentic behaviour|crowdtangle|election|facebook|italy|link sharing|social media,2019-09-20T20:42:43.439056,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20T20:41:41.424674,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/citation/,3jteh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wy7rd/,wy7rd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d84d8ac305a6800190b5b65/,5d84d8ac305a6800190b5b65,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3jteh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3jteh,NA

I ask two questions: 1) how do people who live in regions of consistent economic decline interpret the meanings of absent transportation? And thus, 2) what does transportation maintenance look like in those regions? This line of inquiry emerged unexpectedly from a broader interview project. Between 2015 and 2017, I conducted 90 interviews in two communities at opposite ends of a former, Midwestern steel commodity chain. In both a rural, iron mining community and an urban steel manufacturing neighborhood, transportation infrastructure emerged unbidden and central in interviewees’ descriptions of boom and bust. The late 19th and early 20th century construction of industrial transportation—rail, shipping, and roadways—was recalled by interviewees as facilitating both economic growth and cultural connection required for the social thriving of these communities. The closure of the anchor companies in these communities, then, was the climax in interviewees’ narratives, and the decline (both intentional and natural) of industrial transportation infrastructure appeared again and again as a visible, experienced, and emotional metaphor of the gradual disconnection and loss they experienced. References to declines in industrial transportation often segued to frustrations about the uneven distribution of public transportation (bus and passenger train) or highways. Declines in industrial employment and infrastructures propelled massive depopulation in my case study regions; depopulation, in turn, caused disinvestment in public transportation. This paper expands on the transportation track themes of marginalization of certain segments of the population, with a particular focus on the lived experiences of deindustrialization.",TRUE,FALSE,embodiment|infrastructure|metaphor|rust belt|transportation,2019-09-20T20:38:21.922019,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20T20:38:10.912565,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/citation/,3mhca,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d84cc8f305a6800170ba768/,5d84cc8f305a6800170ba768,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3mhca/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3mhca,NA

This study describes the development and validation the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS-36) which measures the extent to which females’ menstrual practices and environments meet their needs. 
Methods. A 54-item pool was developed following systematic-review of qualitative and quantitative studies and expert feedback. Item reduction and scale validation were undertaken using a cross-sectional survey of 538 menstruating schoolgirls in Soroti, Uganda. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a sub-sample of 52 girls two weeks after the first administration. Construct validity was tested through relationships with hypothesised correlates: confidence to manage menses, self-reported school absenteeism, and mental health symptoms. 
Results. The final MPNS-36 comprises 28 items applicable to all respondents, and 8 items capturing washing and drying experiences for those reusing menstrual materials. A four-factor solution for the core 28 items was the best fit for the data (RMSEA=0.028-0.029; CFI=0.961-0.964; TFI=0.957-0.959), supplemented by two factors for reuse (RMSEA=0.021-0.030; CFI=0.987-0.994; TFI=0.981-0.991). Subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores to support accessibility for practitioners. Subscales were ‘material and home environment needs’ (11 items, α-ordinal=0.84), ‘transport and school environment needs’ (5-items, α-ordinal=0.73), ‘material reliability concerns’ (3-items, α-ordinal=0.55), ‘change and disposal insecurity’ (9-items, α-ordinal=0.80), ‘reuse needs’ (5-items, α-ordinal=0.76), and ‘reuse insecurity’ (3-items, α-ordinal=0.56). Relationships between subscales and hypothesised correlates supported validity. Home- and school-based items were more strongly associated with confidence to manage menstruation at home and school, respectively. Higher scores predicted not missing school during the last menstrual period (total score: OR=2.62, 95%CI=1.52-4.50). Test-retest reliability was moderate (total score: ICC(2,1)=0.69).
Conclusions. The MPNS-36 demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity. It is the first measure to capture women and girls perceived menstrual hygiene and may be used across a range of study designs to assess menstrual needs. Future research should explore the suitability and sensitivity of the measure across contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,menstrual health|menstrual hygiene|outcome assessment|psychometrics,2019-09-20T09:10:43.418954,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20T09:10:20.396243,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/citation/,djh4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qshkc/,qshkc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d83bdc0b3103d00164f543e/,5d83bdc0b3103d00164f543e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/djh4x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/djh4x,NA

On the basis of a representative sample of the German population, which includes 1403 respondents who were interviewed at three waves separated by 6 months, we investigate the privacy paradox from a longitudinal perspective. Using a cross-lagged panel model with random intercepts, we differentiate between-person relations from within-person effects. Results revealed that people who were more concerned about their online privacy than others also shared slightly less personal information and had substantially more negative attitudes toward information sharing (between-person level). People who were more concerned than usual also shared slightly less information than usual (within-person level). We found no long-term effects of privacy concerns on information sharing or attitudes 6 months later. The results provide further evidence against the privacy paradox, but more research is needed to better understand the variables’ potential causal relations.",TRUE,FALSE,information sharing|longitudinal analysis|open code|open data|open material|open science|panel data|privacy|privacy concerns|privacy paradox|ri-clpm|structural equation modeling,2019-09-20T09:03:46.704930,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20T09:03:28.316724,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/citation/,fm4h7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4wabh/,4wabh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d83b1b3b3714e001988a7f3/,5d83b1b3b3714e001988a7f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm4h7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fm4h7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fm4h7,NA

This research is a qualitative study aimed at describing indigenous fashion for the community. The research location focuses on three villages namely Kayeli village, Kubalahin Village and Wasi Village with consideration of the traditional clothing use which is more often found in comparison of other villages in Buru Island. The number of informant interviewed by 25 people, consisting of customary figures, community leaders, leaders of indigenous institutions and village apparatus as well as local people residing at the research site. Analytical techniques used to follow the concept of Miles and Huberman where activities in the analysis of qualitative data are conducted interactively and continuously. The results showed that customary clothing in all three locations had several similarities in the use as well as differences in the placement of custom fashions. The villagers of Kayeli and Wasi used traditional clothes for the activities of receiving indigenous guests and traditional activities that took place in the village, while the community was kubalahin using traditional clothes while the traditional ritual was carried out. For people of the village Kayeli customary clothing has a value of sacral that must be obeyed by everyone who uses it, as well as in the village of Wasi and Kubalahin, they assume that identity in the customary clothing should be maintained with not arbitrary use Or placing custom
