We argue that the pandemic is especially challenging for students from socially disadvantaged and educationally deprived homes as parental engagement and resources are hugely important to guide and support the learning process during the school closure period.
To examine how well parents were able to help their children with schoolwork during the homeschooling period in Germany, we used data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) collected during the first homeschooling period in May/June 2020. Taking known mechanisms of inequality of educational opportunity into account, we explore the effects of parents’ aspirations and cultural, social, and economic capital on the ability to help their children.
Our results show that although the majority of parents were able to provide good support with schoolwork, we found the expected inequalities due to social background. Low educated parents are twice as likely to be unable to provide sufficient support compared to highly educated parents. In our multivariate analyses, family resources show a significant positive effect on the likelihood that parents were able to help.
Moreover, regardless of the social or cultural capital endowment of the parents, good technical equipment in the household is associated with a higher probability of support. Thus, ensuring technical home equipment could be a way to promote an educationally supportive learning environment across all social groups.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|educational inequality|Germany|homeschooling|learning environment|social background,2021-03-24T15:12:15.641727,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24T15:11:38.437436,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.5157/NEPS:SC2:9.0.0|https://www.neps-data.de,no,,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/citation/,vsdq4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6059dc67818bde00663af7ea/,6059dc67818bde00663af7ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vsdq4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vsdq4,NA

Our aim was to estimate DALYs directly due to COVID-19 in Scotland, during 2020; and contextualise its population impact relative to other causes of disease and injury.

Methods: National deaths and daily case data were used. Deaths were based on underlying and contributory causes recorded on death certificates. We calculated DALYs based on the COVID-19 consensus model and methods outlined by the European Burden of Disease Network. DALYs were presented as a range, using a sensitivity based on Years of Life Lost estimates using: cause-specific; and COVID-19 related deaths. All estimates were for 2020.

Findings: In 2020, estimates of COVID-19 DALYs in Scotland ranged from 96,500 to 108,200. Direct COVID-19 DALYs were substantial enough to be framed as the second leading cause of disease and injury, with only ischaemic heart disease having a larger impact on population health. Mortality contributed 98% of total DALYs.

Interpretation: The direct population health impact of COVID-19 has been very substantial. Despite unprecedented mitigation efforts, COVID-19 developed from a single identified case in early 2020 to a condition with an impact in Scotland second only to ischaemic heart disease. Periodic estimation of DALYs during 2021, and beyond, will provide indications of the impact of DALYs averted due to the national roll-out of the vaccination programme and other continued mitigation efforts, although new variants may pose significant challenges.",TRUE,FALSE,burden of disease|coronavirus|COVID-19|DALY|disability-adjusted life year|European Burden of Disease Network|population health|Scottish Burden of Disease|YLD|YLL,2021-03-24T21:48:24.841202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24T21:47:56.559834,FALSE,NA,no,"Summary data from the datasets supporting the conclusions of this article that were used to estimate COVID-19 morbidity in Scotland are available online in the Supplementary Material section.

While a growing body of work has examined inequities with respect to long-range transportation planning, less research examines how equity is incorporated in short-term planning processes via the Transportation Improvement Program. This research reviewed how the metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) that serve the 40 largest US urbanized areas used equity-based criteria for transportation project prioritization in regional planning. Just over half deployed at least one equity criterion for allocating transportation funds, which fell into one of six categories with varying degrees of complexity and potential for impact. While most MPOs included equity in their prioritization criteria, the methods could be improved to better align with more complete definitions of transportation equity, focusing on how targeted groups are defined, more comprehensive methods for equity evaluation, and an increase in the weight that equity is given in prioritization.

For example in the United States, Black and Hispanic scholars are underrepresented across the tenure-track, and while women’s representation has increased over time, they remain a minority in many academic fields. Here we investigate the representativeness of faculty childhood socioeconomic status and whether it may implicitly limit efforts to diversify the professoriate in terms of race, gender, and geography. Using a survey of 7218 professors in PhD-granting departments in the United States across eight disciplines in STEM, social sciences, and the humanities, we find that the estimated median childhood household income among faculty is 23.7% higher than the general public, and faculty are 25 times more likely to have a parent with a PhD. Moreover, the proportion of faculty with PhD parents nearly doubles at more prestigious universities and is stable across the past 50 years.

The application of detailed mortality rates by demographics and other determinants of mortality is crucial for obtaining an unbiased representation of the wealth distribution of the living. Yet, in this paper we suggest that a simplified mortality multiplier method, derived using average mortality rates and aggregate tabulations by estate size, may be sufficient to derive compelling estimates of wealth concentration. We show that the application of homogeneous multipliers leads to estimates that are close in level and trend to the concentration of wealth derived in the existing literature with the detailed mortality multiplier method for a variety of countries. The use of mortality rates graduated by estate size does not confute this finding. We also derive the general formal conditions for the similarity between the distributions of wealth of the living and estates at death and discuss the main caveats. These findings may unlock a wide array of aggregate estate tabulations, previously thought to be unusable, for estimating historical trends of wealth concentration.

I measure upward mobility as the likelihood of obtaining at least a primary education for individuals whose parents did not finish primary school, whereas downward mobility as the likelihood of failing to complete primary education for individuals whose parents completed at least primary school. In addition, I explore the geography of educational IGM using nearly 400 “provinces” (coarse administrative units similar to states in the U.S.) and more than 6,000 “districts” (fine administrative units similar to counties in the U.S.). I document wide cross-country and within-country heterogeneity. In LAC, the distance between the most and least upwardly mobile country is close to what has been recently documented in Africa, although the least mobile countries in Africa are less mobile than the least mobile in LAC. I document a declining trend in the mobility gap between urban and rural populations, but I do not find important differences by gender. Within countries, the level of mobility is highly correlated to the share of primary completion of the previous generation, which suggests a high level of inertia. In addition, upward (downward) mobility is negatively (positively) correlated to distance to the capital and the share of employment in agriculture, but positively (negatively) correlated to the share of employment in industry.

Here, we identify subsets of scenarios of the IPCC 5th (AR5) and forthcoming 6th (AR6) Assessment Reports that project 2005-2040 fossil-fuel CO2 emissions growth rates most consistently with observations from 2005-2020 and International Energy Agency (IEA) projections to 2040—71% of these scenarios project between 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C of warming by 2100, with a median of 2.2 degrees C. Though these scenarios do not fully capture uncertainty about future emissions and warming, and they assume continued mitigation progress, our results suggest the world is presently on a lower emissions trajectory than is often assumed.

However, previous studies have employed resource-intensive audit and data collection methods such as the authors or volunteers manually searching for and tagging individual reading list items by characteristic such as author country or place of publication. This can be prohibitive to repeating the study at different time periods or on large reading list data sets, which leads to a gap in evidence-based data to support and inform curriculum decolonisation. We describe a novel computational method applied to 568 articles, representing 3,166 authors from the Imperial College London Masters in Public Health (MPH) programme over two time periods (2017-18 and 2019-20). Using summary statistics, we found a shift in composite geographic distribution of reading lists sources across the two time periods studied and relate this to interventions to decolonise the curriculum at Imperial. Our approach to applying a computational method to produce data as evidence in decolonisation toolkits is discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,curriculum|decolonisation|geographic bias|Higher Education|reading lists,2021-03-23T12:08:01.324338,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-23T12:07:33.480288,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/cyj2x/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/citation/,375bh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cyj2x/,cyj2x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6058c950e8afef02475f1ab8/,6058c950e8afef02475f1ab8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/375bh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/375bh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/375bh,NA
