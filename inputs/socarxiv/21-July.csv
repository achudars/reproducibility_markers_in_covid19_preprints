An international survey experiment,"Our knowledge of support for affirmative action policies (AAP) and its determinants is mainly restricted to the US context. However, AAP polarise the public debate in Western democracies as they involve favouring a candidate at the cost of others because of group membership. Against this backdrop, we ran a factorial survey experiment in Denmark, France and Germany on the introduction of a hypothetical regulation favouring women and immigrants by equal qualifications in the recruitment process for a managing position. Our data show that support for AAP is significantly larger for women than for immigrants. Moreover, support for AAP for both target groups is much higher in France than in Germany or Denmark. Germans and Danes show similar lower levels of support for AAP for immigrants, while support for AAP for women is higher in Germany than Denmark. We conducted multilevel regression models to investigate the power of several attitudinal factors in explaining these target group and country differences. From these models, we drew two conclusions: First, respondents’ varying level of ethnic and gender prejudice and perceived disadvantage faced by women and immigrants can entirely explain target group differences in support for AAP. Second, the differences between Germany and Denmark in support for AAP for women can be explained by national differences in the level of prejudices and perceived disadvantage of both target groups and attitudes toward state intervention. However, this set of attitudinal variables cannot explain why support for AAP is much higher in France than in Germany and Denmark.",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative survey|Gender|Identity politics|Immigration|Political attitudes|Vignette experiment,2021-06-14T09:46:00.874890,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-14T09:45:50.036293,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/citation/,hxbeu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c7222e18f70b038ea759c2/,60c7222e18f70b038ea759c2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxbeu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hxbeu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hxbeu

Building on Haney’s contextual approach, this chapter will present a co-produced qualitative analysis of research findings on separated mothers in prison. This collaboration between a mother with lived experience of the prison system and a prison researcher will draw on feminist criminological work reflecting on personal experience of the prison system. Interweaving lived experience reflections with a study of maternal imprisonment, we discuss how imprisoned mothers’ experiences of separation from their children are mediated by social support and wider systemic issues with the criminal justice system. Three aspects were emphasised by mothers and prison staff: 1) the impact of family relationships; 2) wider systems and agencies beyond prison; 3) prison mother-baby units.

It is widely understood that the existing mechanisms which shape health inequalities have resulted in COVID-19 outcomes following this same, familiar, pattern. Our aim was to estimate inequalities in the population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland, measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2020. These were scaled against pre-pandemic inequalities in DALYs combined across all causes, derived from the Scottish Burden of Disease (SBoD) study.
Methods: National deaths and daily case data were input into the European Burden of Disease Network consensus model to estimate DALYs. Total Years of Life Lost (YLL) were estimated for each area-based deprivation quintile of the Scottish population. Years Lived with Disability were proportionately distributed to deprivation quintiles, based on YLL estimates. Inequalities were measured by: the range, Relative Index of Inequality (RII), Slope Index of Inequality (SII), and attributable DALYs were estimated by using the least deprived quintile as a reference. Overall, and inequalities in, COVID-19 DALYs were scaled against pre-pandemic estimates of inequalities across all causes from the SBoD study.
Results: Marked inequalities were observed across several measures. The SII was 2,048–2,289 COVID-19 DALYs per 100,000 population. The RII was 1.16, meaning that the rate in the most deprived areas was around 58% higher than the mean population rate, with 40% of COVID-19 DALYs attributed to differences in area-based deprivation. Overall DALYs due to COVID-19 ranged from 7–20% of the annual pre-pandemic impact of inequalities in health loss combined across all causes.
Conclusion: The substantial population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland was not shared equally across areas experiencing different levels of deprivation. The extent of inequality due to COVID-19 was similar to averting all annual DALYs due to diabetes. In the wider context of population health loss, overall ill-health and mortality due to COVID-19 was, at most, a fifth of the annual population health loss due to inequalities in multiple deprivation. Implementing effective policy interventions to reduce health inequalities must be at the forefront of plans to recover and improve population health.",TRUE,FALSE,burden of disease|coronavirus|COVID-19|DALY|deprivation|disability-adjusted life year|European Burden of Disease Network|inequality|population health|Scottish Burden of Disease|YLD|YLL,2021-06-15T00:20:21.523181,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-15T00:20:09.088389,FALSE,NA,no,"Summary data used to construct the figure and table in this article are available as supplementary material.

The population represented by these inflows comprised approximately 470 thousand immigrants. The data was drawn from two special 2016 census tables which collected information on immigrants' admission categories (economic, family and refugee) and their reported ethnic ancestries. Explorations focused on the following aspects: census counts and periods of arrival, residential preferences, admission class mix, population configurations and human capital attainment profiles. Five main historical immigrant waves had been already been identified by Canadian scholars: Lead or Eurolatino, Andean, Coup, Central American and Technological or Professional. Evidence of the presence of these immigrant waves was found in the census data explorations undertaken. Census figures revealed that the largest ethnic immigrant inflow corresponded to those reporting Spanish ancestry (158 thousand or 34% of the total) followed by the Colombian, Mexican, Salvadoran and Peruvian inflows. Residential concentrations in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec were also detected. Explorations suggest that ""Latino"" communities in Canada are emerging as the demographic product of a mixture of admission classes which are uniquely distributed in age-gender cohorts of their respective population configurations. Human capital attainment explorations revealed that inflow members of the working populations corresponding to the fifth technological or professional wave from countries such as Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia ranked at top levels of education and income achievements, those admitted as economic class in particular. The study of Latin American ethnic inflows to Canada is especially relevant for social policy because it represents a ""collective"" case study where the researcher is able to summarize a complex immigration picture through the examination of the geographical region representing a sample of units which ensures maximum variation in terms of several push-pull migratory factors at work.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 Census|Canada|Immigration|Latin America,2021-06-13T23:31:06.679235,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-13T23:30:49.985361,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,None,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/citation/,a8e2z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c69301da0ff2035b390c1a/,60c69301da0ff2035b390c1a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8e2z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a8e2z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a8e2z

Writing this book aims to facilitate understanding for all levels of society regarding state defense management in a broader perspective. The management of state defense more broadly includes the meaning, causes, elements, history, and challenges in defending the state; the condition of the Indonesian nation; main character and role mismatch; what it takes to become a great nation; the existence of economic growth; foreign policy and diplomacy capabilities; multicultural society as an asset; and disaster management as part of defending the nation. The book “Management of State Defense: A Modern Approach to Becoming a Great Nation” is intended by the author for all levels of society, from students, teachers, athletes, technicians, doctors, businessmen, and government officials. The target of the wider community is due to the various capacities and roles of the community. Thus, the community can manage this diversity by implementing the right state defense strategy. This book describes the problem of state defense management from a broader and deeper perspective. The state defense management presented includes the concept of defending the state (to equalize perceptions), the actors who play a role in protecting the state (not only in the form of the Military and Police), and the impacts caused in defending the state.

The progress of the nation can be obtained by qualified human resources (HR). Human resources (HR) can be obtained if education in the country is adequate and organized. The role of teachers, in general, is as an educational task, including educating, teaching, and training. In technological advances, many learning media can be obtained quickly, but the role of teachers remains irreplaceable. The book Visible Learning by researcher John Hattie (2013) mentions that one of the five determining factors of student success in achieving achievement is the role of teachers. The magnitude of the role of the teacher shows that the quality possessed by a teacher must be equal. The professionalism of teachers is assessed from various aspects, one of which is the attitude of a teacher when teaching. The attitude of a professional teacher reflects the values contained in Pancasila. Pancasila is still the most appropriate philosophy and paradigm both in reality and ideologically to control Indonesia. This book aims to show the sides of qualified and professional teachers to become outstanding teachers for millennials in the global age. Based on the title and the purpose, the author shows that teachers in Indonesia can become professionals in the millennial generation. The teacher in question starts from kindergarten to upper secondary level. So this book will be helpful for teachers and prospective teachers at any level who want to increase their potential.
