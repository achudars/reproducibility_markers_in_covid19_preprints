Few studies, however, investigate the role and impact of such online platforms on planning outcomes. We evaluate the impact of participant input via a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), a platform to suggest the placement of new bike share stations in New York City (NY) and Chicago (IL). We conducted 2 analyses to evaluate how close planners built new bike share stations to those suggested on PPGIS platforms. According to our proximity analysis, only a small percentage of built stations were within 100 feet (30 m) of suggested stations, but our geospatial analysis showed a substantial clustering of suggested and built stations in both cities that was not likely due to random distribution. We found that the PPGIS platforms have great promise for creating genuine co-production of planning knowledge and insights and that system planners did take account of the suggestions offered online. We did not, however, interview planners in either system, and both cities may be atypical, as is bike share planning; moreover, multiple factors influence where bike stations can be located, so not all suggested stations could be built.

Takeaway for practice: Planners can use PPGIS and similar platforms to help stakeholders learn by doing and to increase their own local knowledge to improve planning outcomes. Planners should work to develop better online participatory systems and to allow stakeholders to provide more and better data, continuing to evaluate PPGIS efforts to improve the transparency and legitimacy of online public involvement processes.",TRUE,FALSE,bike share|co-production|crowdsourcing|PPGIS,2019-01-12T21:42:27.854191,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T21:42:11.033572,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/citation/,mtnza,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a4e36e8da0e001a56b2ab/,5c3a4e36e8da0e001a56b2ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mtnza/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mtnza,https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2018.1476174

Past works have attributed this “openness” to deliberate government strategy or lack of capacity. Most, however, do not consider the role of private social media companies, to whom the state delegates information controls. I suggest that the apparent incompleteness of censorship is largely a result of principal-agent problems that arise due to misaligned incentives of government principals and private media company agents. Using a custom dataset of annotated leaked documents from a social media company, Sina Weibo, I find that 16% of directives from the government are disobeyed by Sina Weibo and that disobedience is driven by Sina’s concerns about censoring more strictly than competitor Tencent. I also find that the fragmentation inherent in the Chinese political system exacerbates this principal agent problem. I demonstrate this by retrieving actual censored content from large databases of hundreds of millions of Sina Weibo posts and measuring the performance of Sina Weibo’s censorship employees across a range of events. This paper contributes to our understanding of media control in China by uncovering how market competition can lead media companies to push back against state directives and increase space for counter-hegemonic discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,bureaucracy|censorship|China|delegation|information control|social media,2019-01-12T20:00:41.099219,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T20:00:13.420560,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/citation/,wn7pr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a2d2d804708001bf8d910/,5c3a2d2d804708001bf8d910,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wn7pr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wn7pr,NA

Decreasing the number of cars on the road through carpooling can mitigate many problems related to transportation, including traffic congestion, emissions, and safety. Mobile information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide communicative and financial capabilities, termed affordances; to make carpooling much more convenient. However, research has yet to distinguish the role of affordances in reaching a critical mass of drivers. This chapter showcases empirical results from an in-depth study of a carpooling app, coupled with an innovative policy pilot to provide toll road discounts for carpool trips registered with the program. 

Results from the pilot countered with a for-profit model suggest drivers require sufficient reimbursement for travel costs and coordination time, to reach a critical mass needed to support a competitive travel option. However, recruitment tactics such as paid and organic media coverage, face-to-face events and incentives, and driver-focused outreach support growth of the carpool system registration, and use. Additional studies are needed to evaluate different combinations of ridesharing affordances and transportation policies to determine whether communities can realize the benefits of a critical mass of ICT-supported carpooling.",TRUE,FALSE,affordances|autonomous vehicles|carpooling|critical mass|ridesharing,2019-01-12T20:02:41.172369,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T20:02:15.504352,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/citation/,xqmhr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a2c867cf3f50018b963fb/,5c3a2c867cf3f50018b963fb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xqmhr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xqmhr,NA

We trace the congressional rollcall votes on 44 bills across seven Congresses (2006-2018), and link them to constituent's perceptions of their representative's votes and their evaluation of their representative.  Correlational, instrumental variables, and experimental approaches all show that constituents hold representatives accountable. A one-standard deviation increase in a constituent's perceived issue agreement with their representative can improve net approval by 35 percentage points.

Digital involvement may be particularly valuable in exploring methods to plan at a megaregional scale. Research is beginning to address digital inequalities, recognizing that broadband and smartphone access may restrict opportunities for disadvantaged groups. However, the geography and equity of participation remain pragmatic issues for practice and research. This paper reviews the geography and equity of the participation methods in Austin, Texas for active transportation (bicycling and pedestrian) through three approaches to co-produce informed plans: in-person meetings, public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), and an emerging smartphone platform that logs trips and encourages input on route quality. In addition to spatial analysis with standard deviational ellipses, we include qualitative case analysis to contextualize the geographic and equity implications of different participation approaches. Results show that both online techniques resulted in a larger geography for participation than in-person meetings, with the regional PPGIS covering the most area. However, review of the income levels in each area shows that use of the smartphone-based crowdsourcing platform was aligned with lowest-income areas. This study shows that online participation methods are not homogeneous regarding geography or equity. In some contexts, smartphone applications can help reach lower-income communities, even when compared with in-person meetings. Crowdsourcing tools can be valuable approaches to increase geography and equity of public participation in transportation planning.",TRUE,FALSE,bicycling|crowdsourcing|equity|GIS|megaregion|public participation,2019-01-12T15:10:26.982152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T15:10:12.560572,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/citation/,9ghrn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c398bf48047080018fceb7a/,5c398bf48047080018fceb7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ghrn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ghrn,https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198118823498

To explore this question, I study the relationship between income and happiness and I analyze the effect religiosity has on this relationship. I propose that income will have a bigger impact on the happiness of those who are non- or less religious compared to those who are very religious. The very religious believe that tough times are tests and they believe that God will, in due season, bless them too. This helps them stay happy and hopeful, even if they are not living in the best conditions. I use the General Social Survey, face-to-face interviews with adults (18 years and older) living in U.S. households, of 2016. I analyze the responses of 1,569 respondents. Consistent with existing research, income is significantly and positively correlated with happiness. However, the correlation between happiness and income is greater among those who are non- or less religious than among those who are very religious. The results confirm that religiosity acts as a buffer to negative life circumstances.",TRUE,FALSE,Happiness|Income|Religion|Religiosity|Religious Belief|Wealth|Well-Being,2019-01-12T15:09:47.246290,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T15:09:24.752735,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/citation/,2tz4y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c38da8c7cf3f50019b5b56f/,5c38da8c7cf3f50019b5b56f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tz4y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2tz4y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2tz4y,NA

A multi-scalar analysis of distributional justice and wind energy in the United States,"The transition towards renewable energy is likely to be uneven across social and spatial dimensions. To ensure this transition is equitable and just, energy injustice has become the key framework for analyzing and interpreting the distribution of energy infrastructure. Wind energy development has experienced a significant gap between broad public support for increased development but persistent localized opposition to proposed projects, indicating that wind represents a locally unwanted land use. We argue that although the negative impacts of wind energy infrastructure are less extreme than those posed by other, more toxic, unwanted land uses, their status as a locally unwanted land use will produce similar distributional injustices as have been found throughout the environmental injustice literature. Using data from both the American Community Survey and the U.S. Wind Turbine Database, we use logistic and Poisson regressions, fixed effects, and temporal lags to evaluate the current landscape of wind energy injustice along the social dimensions of income, race and ethnicity, age, education, labor force participation, and rurality at three spatial scales: between all counties within the contiguous United States, between counties within states with wind energy, and between census tracts within counties with wind energy. We find results vary by scale and whether the model is comparing the presence of any development or the size of that development. The most evidence of injustice is visible at the within-county level related to whether or not there is any wind energy development, with few relationships present when evaluating the absolute size of development.",TRUE,FALSE,Energy justice|Environmental justice|Multilevel model|Renewable energy|United States|Wind energy|Wind farms,2019-01-11T15:15:27.822983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-11T15:14:57.809869,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/citation/,enbd4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c38ad95e8da0e001854f04e/,5c38ad95e8da0e001854f04e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/enbd4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/enbd4,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.101406
