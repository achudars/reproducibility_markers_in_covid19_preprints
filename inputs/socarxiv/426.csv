We argue that it can, but to profit from such contributions requires developing coherent positions at the level of ontology and coherent epistemological views concerning interfield relations in science. In this paper, we carve out a coherent position that makes sense for cultural sociology based on Sperber’s “infra-individualist” and Clark’s “extended cognition” arguments. More substantively, we take on three canonical topics in cultural sociology: language, intersubjectivity, and associational links between elements, showing that the cognitive neurosciences can make conceptual and empirical contributions to the thinking of cultural sociologists in these areas.

Given these two observations, we test the hypothesis that schooling may attenuate the genetic predisposition to poor mental health. Specifically, we estimate associations between a polygenic score (PGS) for depressive symptoms, schooling attainment and gene-environment (GxE) interactions with mental health (depressive symptoms and depression), in two distinct United States datasets at different adult ages- 29 years old in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and 54 years old in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). OLS results indicate that the association of the PGS with mental health is similar in Add Health and the WLS, but the association of schooling attainment is much larger in Add Health than in the WLS. There is some suggestive evidence that the association of the PGS with mental health is lower for more-schooled older individuals in the WLS, but there is no evidence of any significant GxE associations in Add Health. Quantile regression estimates also show that in the WLS the GxE associations are statistically significant only in the upper parts of the conditional depressive symptoms score distribution. We assess the robustness of the OLS results to omitted variable bias by using the siblings samples in both datasets to estimate sibling fixed-effect regressions. The sibling fixed-effect results must be qualified, in part due to low statistical power. However, the sibling fixed-effect estimates show that college education is associated with fewer depressive symptoms in both datasets.",TRUE,FALSE,gene-environment interactions|mental health|polygenic scores|schooling,2019-06-26T21:10:47.884365,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26T21:10:33.575074,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,None,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/citation/,wjp5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d13ac82e200da00186fea1e/,5d13ac82e200da00186fea1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wjp5v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wjp5v

Couples were more likely to report that one person managed the shared pot of money in countries with high gender inequality compared with couples in more gender equal countries. This pattern was not moderated by within-couple earnings equality. We found a cohabitation—marriage gap in income arrangements that is largest where national-level gender equality is high. In more gender equal contexts, married couples were more likely to pool and manage their money together, whereas a larger proportion of married couples assigned one money manager in countries with less gender equality. Cohabiting couples were more likely to keep some money separate than to take-up a pooled, jointly managed approach in more gender equal countries.

We test whether higher levels of educational attainment are associated with the decrease in housework participation as the previous research in countries of the global north suggests. Our findings reveal that education is not likely to reduce housework participation among Japanese women. Married Japanese women with children are unlikely to reduce their time spent on housework with the increase of their educational level and married Japanese women without children are more likely to increase their housework participation proportionately to the level of their education.

Equally, such interactions are consequential for social capital, and may  be a dimension of cultural fit. Thus processes of status attainment and resource allocation may vary across workplaces in concert with their sociability. Using a new measure of time spent with coworkers, constructed using the American Time Use Survey, this paper shows that work explains a great deal more variation in sociability between coworkers than individual characteristics. The extent of shared workplace identities, influenced by occupational competition levels and union membership, and incentives to socialize are two important mechanisms in this process. Moreover, norms and expectations of appropriate behavior in the workplace accompany occupational differences in sociability, and matching these expectations is consequential for workers' earnings.",TRUE,FALSE,coworkers|cultural fit|occupations|organizations|sociability|social interactions|work,2019-06-26T09:59:43.563437,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26T09:59:09.274663,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/citation/,vs6hw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d109073e200da00176e896b/,5d109073e200da00176e896b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vs6hw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vs6hw

social and commercial. While the measurement of commercial performance is
relatively straightforward and well understood, our understanding of the factors
related to measuring social performance is more ambiguous. Is the adoption of
social performance measurement (SPM) practices more related to external pressures, such as the need to demonstrate legitimacy to funders and peers, or is it more closely related to the growing rationalization within the social sector? We examine the relationship between external and internal factors and the adoption of SPM using a novel dataset of 1864 nascent social enterprises from around the world. Our findings suggest support for the argument that the adoption of SPM in social
enterprise is related to the growing rationalization of the social sector, which
challenges some of the past research on this topic, and provides a more nuanced
perspective of SPM in social enterprise.",TRUE,FALSE,impact measurement|legitimacy|performance measurement|rationalization|Social enterprise|social entrepreneurship|Social performance measurement,2019-06-26T10:08:02.848922,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26T10:07:48.485861,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/citation/,8wa5c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y3p4j/,y3p4j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0ec8fb65ffa5001c1def03/,5d0ec8fb65ffa5001c1def03,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8wa5c/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11266-017-9898-1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8wa5c

To address this gap, we offer a micro-interactional analysis examining real-life aggressive bouncer behavior captured by venue surveillance cameras. Quantitative results show that bouncer physical aggression is associated with interactions where bouncers are directly involved as a conflict party, compared to situations where they solely intervene as a third-party. Further, a qualitative analysis of emotional cues identifies anger as a plausible mechanism underpinning bouncer aggression. We consider the implications of these findings for night-time economy violence prevention strategies and discuss the relevance of video data for barroom research.",TRUE,FALSE,aggression|bouncers|CCTV|micro-interaction|night-time economy|video-based observation|violence,2019-06-21T20:53:43.946702,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-21T20:53:18.171914,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/citation/,h6n9y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0d3ba9e200da00196cf7f8/,5d0d3ba9e200da00196cf7f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6n9y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h6n9y/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h6n9y
