Overall, the rate of entry (creation) has been declining over time while the rate of exit (dissolution) has remained steady. New districts tend to be small relative to existing districts and and exhibit slow growth over time.

Even though individuals might make conscious decisions to consume healthy food, their environment might prevent them from doing so. Given the current lack of attention toward a holistic viewpoint that considers obese target users, healthy nutrition, and specifications of a target society, therapy procedures recommended by therapists as well as general healthy nutrition policies have been made useless and much less effective. The case study in this research was conducted on patients with obesity and preliminary studies show lack of success of patients, regardless of their nutrition program recommended by therapists. Observations were interpreted that unhealthy nutrition habits and obesity would not be changed just based on a calorie variable as being calculated in diets, but social, cultural and psychological factors do have an important role in generating obesity, and the disregard for considering such factors have resulted in divergence of patients between health centers, sports clubs, and monitoring groups (whether physicians or nutritionists). The hypothesis generated from such observations would signify that considering cultural-social context and generating a useful model (considering effective variables), together with treatment procedures, would help the patient reach a successful goal. Expansive design was chosen as the design approach in order to emphasize continuing the relation between users and providers of service, even after obtaining the service by a user. This viewpoint and design resulted in the dialogue between user and provider of the service or product. Based on the research, three solution scenarios were generated: considering promoting healthy nutrition culture through schools, general promotion strategies in media and society, and a collective treatment system. Based on priorities and requirements, the third scenario, designing a collective treatment center was chosen and conceptualized through tools such as system map, interaction storyboard, and consumer satisfaction diagram. The value of such a study is based on presentation and institutionalizing the theoretical infrastructures in the area of service design, while diverse solutions would be presented to specialists based on scenario-based design as well.",TRUE,FALSE,Activity Theory|Expansive Design|Healthy Food|Nutrition|Obesity|Service Design,2019-06-07T21:32:23.081265,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-07T21:31:58.488690,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/citation/,kpn7e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9736e8c451d0017ea29cf/,5cf9736e8c451d0017ea29cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kpn7e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kpn7e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kpn7e,NA

Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. To identify the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective, an integrative conceptual framework is needed. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the ""commoning"" process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain recognition for their productions outside and thus reach social and economic inclusion. Despite the difference in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory. As a place of both anchoring and opening, the community territory is the priviledged space where autonomous and consensual control over the governance of common biocultural resources can be exercised.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptive cycle; inclusive agriculture; participatory action research; short value chain; territorial development,2019-06-06T17:53:06.302180,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-06T17:52:40.357040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,all co-authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/citation/,qwtu5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g4znd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/relationships/node/,g4znd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf92b2dd4c7d700163e2a8a/,5cf92b2dd4c7d700163e2a8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qwtu5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qwtu5,NA

The centrality of the Second Amendment in American culture can be better understood through the intersection of American nationalism with Protestant Christianity. Understanding the transformation of the Second Amendment from an important Constitutional amendment to an article of faith in religious nationalism provides new insight about the meaning of guns for American identity. This paper argues that the NRA has capitalized on the religious nationalism that arose in the late 1970s alongside the Moral Majority and has increasingly used religious language to shape the discourse surrounding the Second Amendment. The use of religious rhetoric, such as references to evil, illustrates the merging of American civic religion with the New Christian Right’s rhetoric. Using issues of the American Rifleman to investigate the changing discourse since the mid-1970s, this paper demonstrates how the NRA increased its use of religious language to frame the political debate about gun rights through a religious nationalist lens.",TRUE,FALSE,gun culture|NRA|religious nationalism|Second Amendment,2019-06-05T03:17:47.210327,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-05T03:17:26.172591,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/citation/,t3b4j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf6c6e0fe9cf50018bd47fe/,5cf6c6e0fe9cf50018bd47fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t3b4j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t3b4j,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0276-z

We extend Robert Brandom’s inferentialist account of meaning into scientific representation to argue that representational language is explicatory, not explanatory, in nature. We provide a broader philosophical rationale for inferential accounts of scientific representation, and an epistemologically modest account of the role of models in terms of inferential scorekeeping.

The aim of the present paper is to investigate how translators deal with English 'there' sentences in two translated Arabic texts. The method adopted in the study is a descriptive-analytic one. In Arabic the words 'hunaaka' and 'tammata' are usually used to render English 'there' ; however, the data of the study show that in many cases translators avoid using  these two words. The flexibility of word order in Arabic , in addition to the use of full lexical verbs , more frequently than English does in 'there' sentences , help to translate these sentences adequately into Arabic. It is also found that syntactic restrictions are not the only reason for the fact that many 'there' sentences are not translated using 'hunaaka' and ' tammata'; the discourse and stylistic levels, play a role in the translator's decision to use other means. In some cases, the use of 'hunaaka /tammata' is shown to be optional and in other cases to be obligatory, unless an alternative construction is produced. Major translational changes affecting the information structure of the texts, are not found in the target language.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic-english translation|Arabic existentials|existential –there|hunaaka|tammata,2019-06-04T11:28:21.476949,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:09:20.592757,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/citation/,fdb37,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5f12b096624001ad89876/,5cf5f12b096624001ad89876,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdb37/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fdb37/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fdb37,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.15

Many theatre scholars and playwrights argue that the value of these plays, which were primarily regarded as fiction or imaginative reconstruction of the past, may prevail over history. Theatre, which is considered the most symbolic form of art, can be historically educative and evocatively accurate. Based on the aforesaid arguments, this study aims to explore the dramaturgicals, theatricals or thespians used in Yerima's Attahiru (1999) in order to repudiate and resist the distorted versions of the colonial history of Sokoto Caliphate in an effective and affective way. To achieve this aim, textual analysis is used by combining its important approaches: author-oriented approach and context-oriented approach. This analysis is significant because the researchers investigated the colonial resistance captured in the play through postcolonial theory. In addition, this paper explores the attitudes of the colonialist and the colonised reproduced in the play and how the play helps in the decolonisation process, as well as how the images of the damaged heroes are reconstructed in the play in order to restore national pride and integrity. The play reconstructs and corrects a seriously damaged and awfully misrepresented African spiritual leader, Caliph Attahiru of the old Sokoto Caliphate in Northern Nigeria.",TRUE,FALSE,Attahiru|drama|Nigeria|postcolonial resistance|Sokoto Caliphate,2019-06-04T11:29:01.903077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:09:31.576856,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/citation/,vc3xr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5f004b700fa001d9f7cf9/,5cf5f004b700fa001d9f7cf9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc3xr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vc3xr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vc3xr,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.14
