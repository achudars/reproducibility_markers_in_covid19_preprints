A longitudinal test of the asymmetry thesis of police-citizen contact","Objectives: Test the asymmetry thesis of police-citizen contact that police trustworthiness and legitimacy are affected more by negative than by positive experiences of interactions with legal agents by analyzing changes in attitudes towards the police after an encounter with the police. Test whether prior attitudes moderate the impact of contact on changes in attitudes towards the police.
Methods: A two-wave panel survey of a nationally representative sample of Australian adults measured people’s beliefs about police trustworthiness (procedural fairness and effectiveness), their duty to obey the police, their contact with the police between the two waves, and their evaluation of those encounters in terms of process and outcome. Analysis is carried out using autoregressive structural equation modeling and latent moderated structural models.
Results: The association between both process and outcome evaluation of police-citizen encounters and changes in attitudes towards the police is asymmetrical for trust in police effectiveness, symmetrical for trust in procedural fairness, and asymmetrical (in the opposite direction expected) for duty to obey the police. Little evidence of heterogeneity in the association between encounters and trust in procedural fairness and duty to obey, but prior levels of perceived effectiveness moderate the association between outcome evaluation and changes in trust in police effectiveness.
Conclusions: The association between police-citizen encounters and attitudes towards the police may not be as asymmetrical as previously thought, particularly for changes in trust in procedural fairness and legitimacy. Policy implications include considering public-police interactions as ‘teachable moments’ and potential sources for enhancing police trustworthiness and legitimacy.",TRUE,FALSE,legitimacy|panel analysis|police-citizen encounters|policing|procedural justice,2019-11-18T03:34:22.583635,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-18T03:33:54.320276,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/citation/,adhbm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n5p64/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/relationships/node/,n5p64,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcd8a0c871e81000ea6e5eb/,5dcd8a0c871e81000ea6e5eb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adhbm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adhbm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adhbm,NA

Although understanding the drivers of migration is critical to enacting effective policies, theoretical advances in the study of migration processes have been limited by the lack of data on flows of migrants, or by the fragmented nature of these flows. 
In this paper, we build on existing Bayesian modeling strategies to develop a statistical framework for integrating different types of data on migration flows. 
We offer estimates, as well as associated measures of uncertainty, for immigration, emigration, and net migration flows among 31 European countries, by combining administrative and household survey data from 2002 to 2015. Substantively, we document the historical impact of the EU enlargement and the free movement of workers in Europe on migration flows. 
Methodologically, our approach improves on the Integrated Modeling of European Migration (IMEM) framework by providing a robust statistical framework for evaluating recent migration trends that is flexible enough to be further extended to incorporate new data sources, like social media.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian modelling|Combining data|Europe|International migration|Labour Force Survey|Migration flows|Migration models|Migration statistics|Population registers|Uncertainty,2019-11-15T07:53:41.971686,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T07:53:19.206687,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/citation/,cma5h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcd2b707cbfdf000e9dffa1/,5dcd2b707cbfdf000e9dffa1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cma5h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cma5h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cma5h,NA

We set out a research agenda for answering the question of how platform power is held accountable that is both empirical and normative. Empirically, we emphasize the need to trace how accountability actually operates in practice. What accountability mechanisms exist, how are they used by publics, how do platforms respond, and with what effects? At the same time, we outline a normative agenda to investigate what genuine accountability requires and how existing accountability practices compare to this standard. Informed by deliberative approaches to democracy, and drawing in particular on Rainer Forst’s work on justification, we argue that the accountability of platforms is a question of their power being justified adequately to affected publics and that this depends on the quality of the discursive processes through which decisions about platforms are justified. Focusing on the quality of discursive processes allows us to distinguish critically between cases where publics merely accept platform power, unreflectively and in contexts of limited information and choice, to cases where power is justified through good reasons tested through inclusive public discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet governance|Internet regulation|platform accountability|platform governance|platform regulation,2019-11-15T07:52:41.772841,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T07:52:25.597606,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/citation/,tx2db,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dccd4107cbfdf000c9d4f6c/,5dccd4107cbfdf000c9d4f6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tx2db/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tx2db,NA

Standard and non-standard accents have differing levels of prestige and demonstrate variation across other attitudinal terms. Because prestige can increase the likelihood of information transmission, we explore variation in accent prestige to determine whether accent can be used as a measure of prestige in social transmission experiments. Participants (n=152 US; 142 UK) were presented with standardised recordings of a standard passage, containing lexical terms that highlight phonological differences between accents of English. Passages were spoken by middle-aged white male speakers representing a range of eight accents from the listener’s country of residence and two from the alternative country. Participants rated the speakers on 24 different personal qualities including traits associated with prestige and friendliness. As predicted, participants rated the standard accents favourably for prestige across both locations. Participants perceived location-specific non-standard accents as having lower prestige, and accents deemed as having lower prestige as being friendlier. Accent indexes differential qualities for listeners, regardless of whether the concept is operationalised by the term “prestigious” or multiple terms related to ‘prestige’.

We assess how the construction and proliferation of white knowledge(s) shapes analysis and interpretation, argumentation, peer review, and ultimately, publication.

In this letter, we demonstrate two results. First, we derive bounds for the bias in non-spatial models with omitted spatially-lagged predictors or outcomes. These bias expressions can be obtained without prior knowledge of the network, and are more informative than familiar omitted variable bias formulas. Second, we derive bounds for the bias in spatial econometric models with non-differential error in the specification of the weights matrix. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that an omitted spatial input is the limit condition of including a misspecificed spatial weights matrix. Simulated experiments further demonstrate that spatial models with a misspecified weights matrix weakly dominate non-spatial models. Our results imply that, where cross-sectional dependence is presumed, researchers should pursue spatial analysis even with limited information on network ties.",TRUE,FALSE,bounds|measurement error|omitted variables|spatial dependence,2019-11-13T09:04:22.404179,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-13T09:03:58.267847,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/citation/,8phvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yq46x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/relationships/node/,yq46x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcadf338f0e5e000cd35877/,5dcadf338f0e5e000cd35877,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8phvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8phvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8phvx,NA
