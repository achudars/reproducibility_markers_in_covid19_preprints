the patenting of new technologies like biotechnology and software, unknown

of the claim terms as of a particular point in time. Both the knowledge of
the PHOSITA in a particular field and the meaning of particular terms to
that PHOSITA will frequently change over time. But at which point in time
shall we fix the meaning of the claims?

It is a fundamental principle of patent law that the time at which we
determine the meaning of claim terms varies depending on what legal rule is
at issue. Where the question is one of novelty or nonobviousness - whether
the invention is truly new - the courts compare the patented invention to
the prior art as both were understood at the time of the invention. Where
the question is one of enablement or written description - whether the
inventor understood and described the invention in sufficient detail -
courts evaluate the adequacy of the disclosure based on the meaning of the
claims at the time the patent application was filed. Where the question
involves the meaning of a special patent claim element called a
means-plus-function claim, courts evaluate the scope of that claim element
at the time the patent issues. And where the question involves alleged
infringement of the patent, courts evaluate infringement in at least some
circumstances based on the meaning of the claim at the time of
infringement.

An equally fundamental principle of patent law is that patent claims must
be construed as an integrated whole. In particular, patentees (or accused
infringers, for that matter) are not permitted to argue that a patent claim
means one thing when it comes to validity and something else entirely when
it comes to infringement. Instead, courts give claims a single meaning in
any given case, engaging in only one act of claim construction for any
given patent.

These two principles contradict each other. In this paper, I seek to
resolve this conflict. In Part I of this paper, I document the
distinguished pedigree of both principles. In Part II, I argue that patent
claim terms should have a fixed meaning throughout time, and that that
meaning should be fixed at the time the patent application is first filed.
Part II also discusses some complications that arise as a result of the
prosecution process, and how to deal with the problem of later-developed

While many trademark courts have protected parodies, there are a surprising

expressive parodies often don't apply to brand parodies. Our goal in this
paper is to think about what circumstances (if any) should lead courts to
find parody illegal. We conclude that, despite courts’ increasing attention
to speech interests in recent years, the law’s treatment of parody reflects
too much uncertainty, leaving would-be parodists vulnerable to threats of
legal action by trademark holders. In particular, given the flexibility of
likelihood of confusion analysis, parodists’ fate is usually determined by
the subjective judgment of courts, whose treatment of parody often seems to
turn on instinct rather than trademark principles. We suggest some

skirt the edges of existing intellectual property rights, for example by
taking the ideas but not the expression from a copyrighted work or
""designing around"" the claims of a patent. However, improvers cannot always
avoid the intellectual property rights of the basic work on which they wish
to improve. Some improvements fall within the scope of the preexisting
intellectual property right, either because of an expansive definition of
that right or because economic or technical necessity requires that the
improver hew closely to the work of the original creator in some basic

upon descriptions of technology. However, technologies may have qualities
that are unappreciated or unidentified in a patent description, but which
are nonetheless present. The law refers to these unknown attributes as
inherent in the product or process. What should be done about such
characteristics or qualities of a technology that exist but are not
explicitly described, either through ignorance or inadvertence? This
problem is explicitly presented in at least five different patent
doctrines: anticipation, the on-sale bar, priority disputes,
double-patenting, and enablement; and it casts its shadow across the law
governing subject matter, infringement, and obviousness.

Inherency is also perhaps the most elusive doctrine in all of patent law.
The cases appear to flatly contradict each other, are often accompanied by
dissents, and in the last three years alone have triggered one abortive en
banc rehearing and strong calls for a second. In particular, the courts
have split sharply over whether an element can be inherent in a prior art
reference even if people of ordinary skill in the art do not appreciate the
existence of that element.

In this Article, we argue that this confusion is largely unnecessary. While
many courts have recited as gospel the idea that inherency requires
knowledge or appreciation of the inherent element, in no case does the
application of the inherency doctrine actually turn on knowledge of the
element. Rather, the inherency cases are all ultimately about whether the
public already gets the benefit of the claimed element or invention. If the
public already benefits from the invention, even if they don't know why,
the invention is inherent in the prior art. If the public doesn't benefit
from the invention, there is no inherency.

In Part I, we examine the main thread of inherency cases, those arising out
of the novelty and statutory bar provisions of the Patent Act. We explain
how the courts got off track in their focus on knowledge, and why a focus
on benefit clearly and consistently explains the doctrine. In Part II, we
consider inherency in a different context, one in which the inventor must
show possession of the claimed invention, either to prevent a new matter
rejection or to establish priority of invention. Finally, in Part III, we
discuss the broader implications of this rule, including what the inherency
doctrine may mean for patents on DNA sequences and patents on drugs derived
from traditional knowledge. A proper understanding of the inherency
doctrine may offer a logical explanation for the product of nature cases,
undermining the last significant exception to patentable subject matter.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:12.808330,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:13:33.678000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/citation/,udnxw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gntch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/relationships/node/,gntch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde3cf6c613b01ecd9365c/,57bde3cf6c613b01ecd9365c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udnxw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udnxw

inversion, those who argued less than a decade ago that cyberspace was a
place all its own - and therefore unregulable by territorial governments -
are finding their arguments and assumptions used for a very different end.
Instead of concluding that cyberspace is outside of the physical world,
courts are increasingly using the metaphor of cyberspace as a ""place"" to
justify application of traditional laws governing real property to this new
medium. Dan Hunter's excellent article explains how and why this is
happening with uncanny accuracy, pointing to the power of metaphor in
influencing legal thinking and the particular strength of metaphor in
making the new seem familiar. He also quite correctly observes that
reliance on the cyberspace as place metaphor is leading courts to results
that are nothing short of disastrous as a matter of public policy. Finally,
he concludes that there is no way for the Internet to escape the firmly
entrenched spatial metaphor, either by substituting another metaphor or by
eschewing metaphor altogether. Already, he concludes, the idea of
cyberspace as a place is too well-established in our minds. The result is a
paper that is both extraordinarily important and profoundly depressing.

In this essay, I do not challenge Hunter's argument that the cyberspace as
place metaphor is rampant, nor his conclusion that judicial use of the
metaphor has had pernicious consequences. Rather, I focus on the logical
steps that courts seem to be missing as they move from metaphor to
decision. Thus, in Part I, I explain why the cyberspace as place metaphor
is not a particularly good one. In Part II, I suggest some ways courts
might take account of these differences between the real world and the
Internet. In Part III, I observe that even if one accepts the place
metaphor in toto, it need not follow that everything in this new place must
be privately owned. Nor must it follow that private ownership rights
include complete rights of exclusion. My conclusion is somewhat more
optimistic than Hunter's. While acknowledging the dangers of the cyberspace
as place metaphor and the fact that courts have already started down the
wrong road, I suggest that courts and commentators who think seriously
about the nature of the Internet still have ample room to make reasoned
policy decisions. Though we may easily be misled by metaphor, we need not
be its slaves.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:25.114018,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:12:20.264000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/citation/,bjzw9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kbbtf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/relationships/node/,kbbtf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde385b83f6901f3656297/,57bde385b83f6901f3656297,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bjzw9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bjzw9

to agreements, licensing practices or affirmative conduct involving the use
or disposition of the intellectual property rights or the products they
cover. But sometimes an antitrust claim centers on an intellectual property
owner's refusal to use or license an intellectual property right, perhaps
coupled with efforts to enforce the intellectual property right against
infringers. The allegation may be that the intellectual property right is
so essential to competition that it must be licensed across the board, or
that a refusal to license it to one particular party was discriminatory, or
that in context a refusal to license helped a monopolist to acquire or
maintain market power.

Claims based on a unilateral refusal to license - the subject of this
chapter - present important issues at the center of the tension between
antitrust and intellectual property. The antitrust and intellectual
property laws are not necessarily in conflict. For the most part they serve
complementary goals, though each must limit the scope of the other.
Unilateral refusal to license cases, however, cut to the heart of the
intellectual property owner's right to exclude others from practicing the
intellectual property. As such, efforts to invoke antitrust law in this
context deserve special scrutiny.

Section 2 reviews the basic principles relating to unilateral refusals to
license intellectual property rights. Section 3 discusses in detail the
various sets of circumstances in which antitrust plaintiffs argue for
exceptions to those basic rules. Section 4 distinguishes unilateral from
concerted and conditional refusals to deal.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:30.363747,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:10:23.838000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/citation/,8nbwt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hckf4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/relationships/node/,hckf4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde3119ad5a101f868d871/,57bde3119ad5a101f868d871,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8nbwt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8nbwt

However, because each new technology provides an important input to
subsequent innovation, the exclusive rights conferred by a patent may also
impose significant costs upon follow-on innovators. Optimal patent policy
should seek to maximize the patent incentive effect, while minimizing
burdens placed on future innovation by tailoring the scope of the patent to
the characteristics of each technological sector affected.

In the case of software, recent scholarship has illuminated the innovation
profile of the current industry. Software is characterized by incremental
innovation, relatively low development costs, and short, volatile product
life cycles. Interoperability and compatibility between complementary
products is a major concern, making technical transparency or reverse
engineering critical to product development. This suggests a need for
relatively narrow patents that are relatively easy to obtain, and subject
to the exceptions necessary to ensure interoperation and follow-on
development.

However, current software patent doctrine bears little relationship to this
industrial profile. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit has set an extremely lax standard of disclosure software patents,
resulting in patents scope unconstrained by doctrines of enablement and
written description. Recent changes that make patent law amenable to
software have produced a flood of new applications, allowing firms to adopt
a patent thicket strategy for licensing leverage. At the same time, Federal
Circuit case law suggests that a stringent standard for patent
non-obviousness will be applied to such patents, resulting in relatively
few valid software patents. Optimal software patent doctrine would
constrain scope to deal with patent thicket while lowering the
non-obviousness standard to validate more issued software patents.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:29.081297,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:08:27.461000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/citation/,cmv9r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fu7vn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/relationships/node/,fu7vn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde29d594d9001fdd0de84/,57bde29d594d9001fdd0de84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cmv9r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cmv9r
