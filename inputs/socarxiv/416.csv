First, a causal understanding of validity is not compatible with the standard validation framework, which forces researchers to think critically what it means to measure unobserved constructs. Second, test scores only provide ordinal information about individuals, they are not interval scales and require the use of suitable corresponding methods for their study. Third, measurement invariance, which causes measurement error, may make comparison of test scores across groups invalid. The paper explores these three data problems applied to standardized tests---one mathematics and two language assessments---taken by a cohort of German children. The paper proposes a comparative validation framework for researchers based on nonparametric psychometric models and the representational theory of measurement. This framework can help researchers to determine if data fit the assumptions of a measurement model, to check for various forms of measurement error, and to overcome potential issues. A comparison of competing statistical modeling alternatives reveals substantial differences: By conceptualizing ability as ordinal instead of interval and excluding items that do not fit the assumptions of measurement models, I find a reduction in effect sizes for typical covariates studied in social stratification research.",TRUE,FALSE,childhood|class inequality|psychometrics|quantitative research on education|standardized testing,2019-07-18T16:06:25.250974,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T17:11:05.781997,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,Alejandra,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/citation/,tyhrg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d30608c835aff0017543662/,5d30608c835aff0017543662,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyhrg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tyhrg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tyhrg,NA

We test whether this travels to a young middle-income democracy where women's rights are tenuous: South Africa. Contrary to prior work we find no discernible effect on attitudes about women's rights or partisan identification. Using a unique dataset of over 7,500 respondents and an equivalence testing approach, we reject the null hypothesis of any effects of 5 percentage points or greater at conventional levels of statistical significance. We speculate that our null findings relate to opportunity: daughter effects are more likely when parents perceive economic, social, and political opportunities for women. When women's customary status and de factor opportunities are low, as in South Africa, having a daughter may have no effect on parents' political behavior.

However, like other nonlinear probability models, statistical network model parameters can only be identiﬁed to a scale and cannot be compared between groups or models ﬁt to the same network. This study addresses these issues by developing methods for mediation and moderation analyses in exponential random graph models (ERGM). It ﬁrst discusses ERGM as an autologistic regression to illustrate that ERGM estimates can be aﬀected by unobserved heterogeneity. Second, it develops methods for mediation analysis for both discrete and continuous mediators. Third, it provides recommendations and methods for interpreting interactions in ERGM. Finally, it considers scenarios where interactions are implicated in mediation analysis.

Against this background, policymakers often call for more diversity in the teacher workforce, assuming that migrant students might benefit from being taught by a migrant teacher. Despite the popularity of this claim, there is almost no research-based rationale for increasing the diversity of teachers in Europe. This paper is a step to fill this research gap for Germany. We aim to assess whether migrant teachers reduce ethnic educational disadvantages. Our analyses are based on the ‘IQB National Assessment Study on Languages 2008/2009’, a nationally representative large-scale assessment study of ninth-graders that provides information on migration status of both students and teachers. Our dependent variables are objective German language competence scores and teacher-assigned grades. Results run contrary to the widely held expectations. We find virtually no evidence that migrant students benefit from being taught by a migrant teacher.",TRUE,FALSE,education|ethnic disadvantage|Germany|language competence scores|migrant teachers|teacher–student congruence,2019-07-17T12:21:28.518634,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-17T12:20:56.908788,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/citation/,2s8n6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2ca3971c5b4a001da2a56e/,5d2ca3971c5b4a001da2a56e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2s8n6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2s8n6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2s8n6,NA

From the data above, Indonesia must improve its infrastructure and human resources more in an integrated manner so that it can join in the big wave of global trade because geographically, Indonesia is in a strategic position in the world trade route. The basic weakness is the high cost of logistics which includes transportation costs, warehousing costs, inventory storage costs, customer service costs and logistical administrative costs when compared to other countries in the Asian region. Another disadvantage is that there are still various infrastructure standards such as ports, highways and air and water transportation networks and other supporting infrastructure. The lack of availability of funds for infrastructure programs, unclear infrastructure development priorities, uncertain legal rules, and inadequate law enforcement make Indonesia's ranking still inferior to other ASEAN member countries.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-17T12:21:46.161291,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-17T12:21:33.511666,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/citation/,kyxj6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2c9fa745253a001c427cde/,5d2c9fa745253a001c427cde,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kyxj6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kyxj6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kyxj6,NA

In this paper, we focus on the unemployed’s expectations of being stigmatized (stigma consciousness) and the consequences of such negative expectations on job search attitudes and behaviour. Using data from the panel study “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS), we find that the unemployed with high stigma consciousness suffer from reduced well-being and health. Regarding job search, the stigmatized unemployed
are more likely to expect that their chances of re-employment are low, but in contrast, they are more likely to place a high value on becoming re-employed. Instead of becoming discouraged and passive, we find that stigmatized unemployed
individuals increase their job search effort compared to other unemployed individuals. However, despite their higher job search effort, the stigma-conscious unemployed do not have better re-employment chances.",TRUE,FALSE,Expectancy-value theory|Job search|Social stigma|Stigma consciousness|Unemployment,2019-07-15T13:31:43.319487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-15T13:31:10.121016,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/citation/,x8kqh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2c74b5a26b3400180aa4d1/,5d2c74b5a26b3400180aa4d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8kqh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x8kqh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x8kqh,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12651-019-0261-4
