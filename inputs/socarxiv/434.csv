These textbooks are published by different international publishers and used extensively in EFL programs around the globe. Moreover, attitudes do influence language learning. This paper aims to investigate teachers’ attitudes toward the commercial textbooks used in (EFL) programs. In this quantitative research, forty-three EFL instructors were surveyed through a Likert scale questionnaire. The results reveal, in general, the negative attitudes of the teacher towards commercial English textbooks since for them such textbooks are found insufficient in meeting the courses’ aims and objectives, students language proficiency level, their cultural sensitiveness, and their academic backgrounds. The study found teachers opinion vis-à-vis textbooks inappropriate content, a mismatch in learners’ needs and not in agreement with teaching methodologies. The paper offers a few recommendations to the EFL instructors as well as to the instructional designers to adapt and customize commercial textbooks in line with learners’ needs.

This research aims to analyze the speech acts of complimenting in Ukrainian and American cultures in order to use them for teaching pragmatics second language (L2) students. Defining the ways of complimenting in Ukrainian, Russian and American English help to avoid misunderstandings and pragmatic failures. This study uses a method of ethnomethodology. Speach acts are studied in their natural contexts. To carry out this research native speakers of English in the United States and native speakers of Russian and Ukrainian from all over Ukraine were interviewed on-line. The analysis was made on the data that included: 445 Russian, 231 Ukrainian and 245 English compliments. Results of this study show how native speakers tend to compliment people: syntactical structure of expressions, cultural lexicon, attributes praised and language context. It has implications for teaching English to Ukrainians and for teaching Russian and Ukrainian to speakers of English. Knowing how to use speech acts allows the speaker to have pragmatic competence.

The study follows the methodological synergy approach proposed by Baker et al. (2008), a heuristic methodological approach that combines methods of discourse analysis and corpus-assisted statistical tools including keyword, collocation, and concordance analysis. Drawing on this methodological synergy approach, the investigation yields significant findings contextualized within the socio-economic-political context of the European Union (EU) leave referendum to trace how the issue of immigration is represented in the discourses of the Remain and Leave campaigns. The frequency results show that immigration is one of the most salient topics in the Brexit corpus. Concordance analysis of the word immigrants and collocation investigation of the word immigration reveal opposing attitudes toward immigration in the EU referendum debate. The analysis uncovers negative attitudes toward the uncontrolled flow of immigrants from other EU countries and public concerns about immigrants' negative impacts on wages, education, and health services. Other findings reveal positive attitudes toward immigrants emphasizing their positive contributions to the UK economy.

Punctuation is a largely overlooked stylistic feature in ``stylometry'', the quantitative analysis of written text. In this paper, we examine punctuation sequences in a corpus of literary documents and ask the following questions: Are the properties of such sequences a distinctive feature of different authors?

The cultural evolutionary scholarship disagrees regarding what was the main factor responsible for the emergence and spread of these innovations over the past few millennia. Proponents of the Big Gods Hypothesis suggest that this development should be primarily associated with changes in social complexity, since representations of powerful and morally concerned deities represent a factor promoting cooperation among strangers in large-scale societies and thus a cultural selection advantage for groups adopting these innovations. Advocates of the Affluence Hypothesis suggest that the emergence and spread of morally oriented religious systems has to be primarily coupled with economic development, namely with an increase in affluence, which occurred during the so-called “Axial Age” period. According to this proposal, an increase in affluence enabled adoption of ""slow"" life-history strategies by certain proportion of the population, what led to emergence of new form of religion, emphasizing morality, long-terms goals and practices of self-control. This paper contributes to this debate by focusing on historical setting often referred to in both of these proposals: the ancient Mediterranean. Using quantitative text analysis methods in analyzing a corpus of ancient Greek texts from the period from 800 BC to 400 CE, this study offers a more nuanced view of the process under scrutiny than the one which has been proposed in previous ethnographic and comparative studies. Finding statistically significant differences in the context of usage of the Greek term theos (god) in the texts from the pre-axial and axial period, the obtained results can be more easily interpreted in terms of the Affluence Hypothesis than in terms of the competing account.",TRUE,FALSE,Affluence Hypothesis|Axial Age|Big Gods|Cognitive Science of Religion|Cultural Evolution|Life History Theory|Quantitative Text Analysis|Vector Semantics,2018-12-31T17:30:01.764013,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-31T17:29:46.020628,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb4|Arts and Humanities|Religion|History of Religions of Western Origin|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb7|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Comparative Methodologies and Theories|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/citation/,3tjb7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8j5vm/,8j5vm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c298791a7c0a700183e83e3/,5c298791a7c0a700183e83e3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3tjb7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3tjb7

We show that despite the upheaval, the core pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm remains relatively intact: central bankers believe that they should primarily pursue price stability through targeting low inflation in a transparent manner, and that they need operational independence to achieve this goal. In a bid to address post-crisis conditions and maintain their credibility, however, central bankers have also layered new elements onto the old core. We document both the resilience of pre-crisis beliefs and the process of layering using computer-assisted text analysis and qualitative analysis of 13,586 speeches given between 1997 and 2017 by central bankers from around the world.",TRUE,FALSE,central banking|global financial crisis|layering|monetary policy|policy learning,2018-12-28T15:16:00.808094,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-28T15:15:51.163582,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/citation/,bms5n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sh4vg/,sh4vg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c24e72928af78001b6241ac/,5c24e72928af78001b6241ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bms5n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bms5n/,https://doi.org/10.1111/padm.12567,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bms5n

This study takes issue with unidirectional approaches to researching paratexts in terms of linguistic or sociological accounts, and argues for a bidirectional understanding of paratext to unearth the interplay between structure and agency. Drawing on Genette’s paratextual features and Bourdieu’s sociology, this interactive approach is explored in a series of analyses of paratexts enveloping two Arabic translations of Gibran’s The Earth Gods. Through a discussion of the linguistic manifestations and the socio-historical backdrops of paratexts, the paper argues that the preface with its attendant micro features has the potential to exhibit the translation illusion, which epistemologically foregrounds the stakes and investments that motivate the production of translation.",TRUE,FALSE,Bourdieu|Genette|Gibran|Paratext|Sociology,2018-12-27T13:08:43.449700,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-27T13:08:25.243917,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures",International Journal of Society|Culture &amp; Language,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/citation/,6ey3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c230f167cd9be001b5dfdfe/,5c230f167cd9be001b5dfdfe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ey3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ey3u/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ey3u
