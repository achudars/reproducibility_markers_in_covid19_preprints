The latter assesses learners using different digital means one of which are social media. The present study investigated the impact of social media, as being one aspect of e-assessment tools, on EFL students’ written production. It tried to highlight the nature of this impact, enquired about the reasons behind their writing difficulties, and explored whether these errors were caused by social media or not. This research work relied on a case study that consisted of 31 third-year undergraduates and 22 English teachers at the department of English at Tlemcen University, Algeria. The data were gathered through the use of two questionnaires administered to both learners and instructors plus two writing tasks, one assigned on social media and the other in the classroom. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively through error analysis. After identifying the different errors produced by the students, the findings revealed that a relationship existed between learners’ use of social media and their writing issues. Their intensive use of social media led to a significant decrease in the writing level of the learners who have developed a new form of writing that includes linguistic habits which reflect the informalities often found on a social media environment, and do not necessarily follow the norms and rigours of the English language. They have become unable to distinguish between the formal and informal context to the point that certain linguistic aspects have become fossilized.",TRUE,FALSE,Error analysis|fossilization|linguistic deficiencies|social media|writing,2019-06-07T11:48:42.949898,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-07T11:48:22.324491,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/citation/,e5ya9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9dee089c9830017bcf900/,5cf9dee089c9830017bcf900,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5ya9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e5ya9

Does ICT provide more independence for the learner? As a hypothesis, we propose the following: ICT sharpens learners' willingness and desire to learn while facilitating their access to language and culture. It installs them in a report of independence thus favoring the acquisition of the skills.

The main contributor to this process is always the teacher who has to adhere to the process of change for the purposes of developing his/her own career and improving the quality of teaching. This study aims to determine how action research would improve quality teaching in pre-service and in-service teacher training, and shed light on the reciprocal relationship between action research and innovation. In this paper, action research is considered as a constant independent variable that can enhance the dependent variables of pre-service / in-service teacher training and quality teaching requirements. The latter are supposed to be two purposes of innovation. Innovation is, thus, performed as the usual practice of innovative teachers who take risks of improving quality teaching in a methodological procedure according to their teaching contexts. The study attempts to answer the following questions: What is quality teaching and how does it impact innovation within the quality teaching assurance framework? What is action research and how does it help teachers improve their research and innovation potential?

Even though individuals might make conscious decisions to consume healthy food, their environment might prevent them from doing so. Given the current lack of attention toward a holistic viewpoint that considers obese target users, healthy nutrition, and specifications of a target society, therapy procedures recommended by therapists as well as general healthy nutrition policies have been made useless and much less effective. The case study in this research was conducted on patients with obesity and preliminary studies show lack of success of patients, regardless of their nutrition program recommended by therapists. Observations were interpreted that unhealthy nutrition habits and obesity would not be changed just based on a calorie variable as being calculated in diets, but social, cultural and psychological factors do have an important role in generating obesity, and the disregard for considering such factors have resulted in divergence of patients between health centers, sports clubs, and monitoring groups (whether physicians or nutritionists). The hypothesis generated from such observations would signify that considering cultural-social context and generating a useful model (considering effective variables), together with treatment procedures, would help the patient reach a successful goal. Expansive design was chosen as the design approach in order to emphasize continuing the relation between users and providers of service, even after obtaining the service by a user. This viewpoint and design resulted in the dialogue between user and provider of the service or product. Based on the research, three solution scenarios were generated: considering promoting healthy nutrition culture through schools, general promotion strategies in media and society, and a collective treatment system. Based on priorities and requirements, the third scenario, designing a collective treatment center was chosen and conceptualized through tools such as system map, interaction storyboard, and consumer satisfaction diagram.

Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. To identify the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective, an integrative conceptual framework is needed. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the ""commoning"" process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain recognition for their productions outside and thus reach social and economic inclusion. Despite the difference in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory. As a place of both anchoring and opening, the community territory is the priviledged space where autonomous and consensual control over the governance of common biocultural resources can be exercised.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptive cycle; inclusive agriculture; participatory action research; short value chain; territorial development,2019-06-06T17:53:06.302180,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-06T17:52:40.357040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,all co-authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/citation/,qwtu5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g4znd/,g4znd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf92b2dd4c7d700163e2a8a/,5cf92b2dd4c7d700163e2a8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwtu5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qwtu5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qwtu5

We study the role of forum size (number of people in a forum) on contribution of content per person with a field experiment on a massive open online course (MOOC).  We find that larger forums elicit more contribution per person. The number of questions and other help-seeking threads posted per person was unchanged by size, but replies and other more conversational posts increased sharply.  Most of the positive effect of size was in a subset of socially responsive subjects.  The implication of social responsiveness driving our results is that the unequal distribution of contribution on online platforms is unlikely to be easily changed: if more contributions are elicited from infrequent contributors, the greatest contributors would contribute even more due to there being more to respond to.",TRUE,FALSE,discussion forums|free riding|group size|knowledge sharing|lurkers|Massive Open Online Courses|online engagement|user-generated content,2019-06-06T17:53:47.218469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-06T17:53:20.607426,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/citation/,47rng,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wuenx/,wuenx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf91101d4c7d700163e1882/,5cf91101d4c7d700163e1882,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47rng/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/47rng/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/47rng

The centrality of the Second Amendment in American culture can be better understood through the intersection of American nationalism with Protestant Christianity. Understanding the transformation of the Second Amendment from an important Constitutional amendment to an article of faith in religious nationalism provides new insight about the meaning of guns for American identity. This paper argues that the NRA has capitalized on the religious nationalism that arose in the late 1970s alongside the Moral Majority and has increasingly used religious language to shape the discourse surrounding the Second Amendment. The use of religious rhetoric, such as references to evil, illustrates the merging of American civic religion with the New Christian Right’s rhetoric. Using issues of the American Rifleman to investigate the changing discourse since the mid-1970s, this paper demonstrates how the NRA increased its use of religious language to frame the political debate about gun rights through a religious nationalist lens.",TRUE,FALSE,gun culture|NRA|religious nationalism|Second Amendment,2019-06-05T03:17:47.210327,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-05T03:17:26.172591,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/citation/,t3b4j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf6c6e0fe9cf50018bd47fe/,5cf6c6e0fe9cf50018bd47fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t3b4j/,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0276-z,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t3b4j
