The survey method was used to determine the levels of students’ knowledge of three global environmental problems. In this study, drawings (separate for each topic) and open-ended questions specific to all three topics were used as data collection tools. The data obtained from drawings and open-ended questions were analyzed together and assessed based on three knowledge categories (informed view, transitional view, and naïve view). The results indicated that the levels of secondary school students’ knowledge about three global environmental problems were low. It was also found that they held various misconceptions and their knowledge levels on each topic were close to each other. The results of the Pearson Correlation indicated that there was a significant relationship between the levels of secondary school students’ knowledge about only GW and OLD, but a weak correlation. The results of MANOVA indicated that there was a significant difference in the mean scores of students’ knowledge of GW from 8th to 7th-grade students, while there was a significant difference in favor of 8th-grade students with respect to the topics of AR and OLD.",TRUE,FALSE,Acid Rain|Global Warming|Ozone Layer Depletion|Science Education|Secondary School Students,2021-03-26T22:10:38.699435,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-26T22:10:02.120360,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/citation/,ehq2s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605df0c1763cf500ca1b264e/,605df0c1763cf500ca1b264e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ehq2s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ehq2s/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.187,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ehq2s

This ideal vaccination strategy needs of a high degree of international cooperation among different countries. International initiatives as COVAX, advocated by the WHO, try to achieve such goal. However, in the present scenario with limited number of vaccine doses, Game Theory model also predicts that they are becoming goods subject to the Tragedy of the Commons. Countries with the capability to control vaccine dose distribution will desert from the international agreements, vaccinating first to their own nationals. If such behaviour is known by other countries (as is happening now) more countries will be tempted to desert as well. Eventually it will end in a Nash equilibrium, which stops the ideal vaccination strategy. Furthermore, in poorer countries, with great difficulties to get access to vaccine doses, these will be transformed into Giffen goods. Vaccination data available to date, show that we are in a scenario where vaccine doses have transformed into goods subject to the Tragedy of the Commons, countries desert from cooperation reaching a Nash equilibrium and vaccine doses are close to become a Giffen good for the poorer countries. This dynamic will not only rise the number of infected and dead by COVID-19, but also the likelihood of an escape mutant (in the SARS-CoV-2 populations) will be increased. If, eventually, this turns out to be the new scenario new vaccines could be developed for those new escape mutant strains, going back to a very similar setting as the starting one. Most likely, the world will reach a Pareto optimality (equilibrium between desertion and cooperation) due the pressure of those who seek high levels of cooperation to attain a global vaccination strategy.",TRUE,FALSE,|COVID-19 vaccines|Giffen goods|Nash equilibrium|Tragedy of the Commons,2021-03-29T19:30:27.084792,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-29T19:29:59.903122,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Javier García y García de Alcañíz|Julia Romero-López|Victoria López-Rodas y Eduardo Costas,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/citation/,m5pnu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605ddf51229503009d6eb5fa/,605ddf51229503009d6eb5fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m5pnu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m5pnu

However, unlike in countries with a centralized register, local authorities in Germany administer their own registers. This not only makes sampling for a nation-wide survey more costly and cumbersome but may also result in gaps in the gross sample, as selected municipalities can refuse the use of their register for sampling purposes. If alternative municipalities to substitute refusals are not available, different sampling methods are required. With the present study, we aimed at testing the usability of the Address Database of the Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously carried out two surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of 3,000 each; one drawn from the city’s population register and the other from the ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well, both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD can be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the usage of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys. More importantly, in the net sample of the DPD survey, women and young persons were considerably under-represented. This indicates coverage issues for which DPD provided no further information.

The historical record catalogues this relationship in several ways including the mass displacement of Native children into boarding schools throughout the 19th century and the widespread adoption of Native children into non-Indian homes in the 20th century. Child removal was commonplace, and explicitly directed at the elimination of Native cultures and nations through aggressive assimilation. This violent legacy eventually prompted the passage of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978. The ICWA introduced federal protections for Native children, families, and tribes against unnecessary removal and affirmed the role of the tribe as an important partner in child welfare proceedings. To what extent has this landmark legislation changed the prevalence and frequency of Native family separation since 1978? What can be done to reduce the threat of the child welfare system on the well-being of Native families today? 
In this Article, we use administrative and historical data to statistically evaluate the magnitude of change in AIAN family separation since the passage of the Indian Child Welfare Act and locate the institutional pathways by which AIAN families are funneled into the child welfare system. Our findings reveal that despite long-standing treaty responsibilities to support the health and well-being of tribal nations, high rates of separation among AIAN children persist. In particular, we find that the frequency of AIAN children's placement into foster care has remained relatively stable since the passage of the ICWA, that AIAN children remain at incredibly high risk of family separation through the child welfare system, and that the post-investigation removal decision by child welfare agencies is a key mechanism of inequality in family separation. We situate these findings within theories about settler colonialism and Indigenous dispossession to illustrate that the continuous removal of Native children from their families and tribal communities is not an anomaly. Instead, we argue that the very intent of  a White supremacist settler-state  is to dismantle Native families and tribal nations. Based upon these findings, we shift our focus away from the particularities of Indian child welfare and argue  that the child welfare system more broadly must be abolished in order to stop the routine separation of Native children from their families by the state. Left intact, child protection systems prioritize surveillance and separation over welfare and support, affecting non-White children and families in immeasurable ways. We suggest that the ICWA has provided, and will continue to provide, a necessary intervention to protect Native families so long as this intrusive system remains. We conclude by exploring how an abolitionist approach to child welfare might positively impact Native families  by immediately redirecting social and financial resources into the hands of Native families and working cooperatively with tribal communities to promote Indigenous communities of care.",TRUE,FALSE,Abolition|Child welfare|Foster care|Indian Child Welfare Act,2021-03-26T22:12:28.180531,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-26T22:12:01.451526,FALSE,NA,no,Data are available upon request from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/citation/,mqgtc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605d911c763cf500701b2925/,605d911c763cf500701b2925,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqgtc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mqgtc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mqgtc

masyarakat desa tabatan dalam memenuhi kebutuhan untuk bertahan hidup, 2) 
bentuk-bentuk mata pencaharian atau pekerjaan sampingan para nelayan, 3) 
permasalahan yang terdapat pada desa tabatan. Penelitian ini dilakukan di Desa 
Tabatan Kecamatan Jenamas Kabupaten, Barito Selatan Provinsi, Kalimantan Tengah. 
Teknik mengumpulkan data yang digunakan peneliti adalah melakukan observasi, 
wawancara dan mengamati aktivitas masyarakat desa dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan 
hidup. Mayoritas masyarakat desa tabatan bekerja sebagai nelayan, yaitu pekerjaan 
yang sangat bergantung terhadap faktor alam seperti kondisi iklim yang sering 
berubah. Kondisi iklim dapat mempengaruhi hasil tangkapan ikan nelayan dan hal 
tersebut berpengaruh terhadap penghasilan masyarakat yang bekerja sebagai nelayan. 
Hasil penelitian ini memperlihatkan bahwa (1) masyarakat memiliki strategi dalam 
penggunaan alat penangkap ikan dengan menyesuaikan kondisi iklim yang sedang 
terjadi (2) sebagian nelayan masyarakat desa juga memiliki pekerjaan sampingan

Yet we lack a systematic and rigorous scientometric review that evaluates how research topics have evolved and by whom has authored them. We review all papers (N=1,901) and authorship contributions (N=3,267) published in the journal between 1947 and 2020. Our techniques employ natural language processing, social network analysis, and a novel mixed-method approach to incorporate un-supervised machine learning models conjoint with qualitative coders. After a brief history of the journal we show that authorship and articles have evolved over time, with a shift to shorter and multi-authored articles, with 34\% female authorships and skewed gender ratios in certain topics. The majority of articles have covered fertility, mortality and family research, studying groups, time and change, with topics expanding and waning in prevalence over time. Children are rarely studied and if examined, in relation to infant mortality or sex-preferences of parents. Research on women focuses on family planning and contraception, fertility decline, unions and divorce, whereas men’s domains are migration, historical demography (war, famine) and employment. Geographical bias is also present with family planning examined in Africa and Asia and fertility decline in North American and Europe.

This is increasingly motivating scholars to strive for more collaborative pedagogic dynamics between teachers and students. At the same time, research into co-creation of Game Based Learning material such as board games has largely focused on the value added to games when educators involve students in the design process. However there has been scant research examining the qualities of co-creational game design exercises as teaching experiences themselves, thus overlooking the opportunity to conceptualise such activities as an innovative teaching tool that can help educators facilitate student engagement and participation. To address this research gap, this paper presents a case study where Project Management students participated in two co-creation workshops designing educational Project Management games. 

Data were collected conducting focus groups at the end of the two workshops. Throughout the paper we have sought to present some positive outcomes of such processes as well as some critical points that emerged through the data that were collected. Mentionable outcomes include a series of positive characteristics of co-creative Game Based Learning activities like enhanced engagement as well as a list of challenges when facilitating such activities. The main findings of this research have been organised in two frameworks, one outlining five positive characteristics of co-creative Game Based Learning activities: engagement with knowledge, knowledge assessment, creativity, communication and the second outlining challenges in facilitating such activities: lack of focus, lack of structure and the need for more practice-oriented games. The suggested frameworks can assist educators conceptualise and utilise such exercises to create more effective and participatory learning environments.",TRUE,FALSE,Board Games|Co-Creation Theory|Education|Game Based Learning|Gamification|Higher Education|Playful Learning|Project Management|Student Engagement,2021-03-26T17:00:22.951350,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-26T17:00:07.623476,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/citation/,jynx3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605cfc90763cf5002d1b339a/,605cfc90763cf5002d1b339a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jynx3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jynx3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jynx3
