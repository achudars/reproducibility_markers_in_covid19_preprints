Panel data evidence from The Netherlands during the Great Recession, 2007–2015","Political developments since the 2008 financial crisis have sparked renewed interest in the electoral implications of economic downturns. Research describes a correlation between adverse economic conditions and support for radical parties campaigning on the populist promise to retake the country from a corrupt elite. But does the success of radical parties following economic crises rely on people who are directly affected? To answer this question, we examine whether individual-level changes in economic circumstances drive support for radical parties across the ideological divide. Analyzing eight waves of panel data collected in The Netherlands, before, during, and after the Great Recession (2007–2015), we demonstrate that people who experienced an income loss became more supportive of the radical left but not of the radical right. Looking at these parties’ core concerns, we find that income loss increased support for income redistribution championed by the radical left, but less so for the anti-immigration policies championed by the radical right.

We test this theory by measuring communication network structure and group outcomes in a population of 1,002 nascent wikis.

Previous studies mainly adopted a synchronic approach, implicitly assuming that the differences between students with and without a migration background, as well as mechanisms underlying these differences, are constant throughout the educational career. This hypothesis is empirically tested thanks to INVALSI data and a series of  four-levels random intercept regression models (student, class, school and province). Results indicate that the importance of contextual factors on the ethnic gap in achievements is marginal to the relevance of individual characteristics, and that children of immigrants underperform natives at each educational level. However, assessing the independent role of ethnicity on the one hand, and migration on the other, it emerges that: while the negative influence of the migration experience is strongest at higher grades, the effect of ethnicity changes from negative to positive during the educational career.

Consistent with previous research, I find that husbands' education has a larger impact than wives' on the probability that couples migrate together.

I find that non-cohabitation is unusual but not unknown among highly educated workers; the prevalence of non-cohabitation among all college-educated workers was 1.9 percent, and the prevalence was as high as 2.8 percent for women and 4.2 percent for men under 30. Consistent with the idea that some couples live apart to solve a dual-career location problem, I also find that non-cohabitation is more common among workers with higher levels of education and workers in occupations with high degrees of geographic clustering.

I test the interaction between school-level racial composition and student-level race as a predictor of special education receipt. I find that as the proportion of White students increases, the risk of lower-status disabilities, such as intellectual disability, increases for Black, Latinx, and Native American students. As the proportion of White students decreases, White students’ risk of higher status disabilities, such as speech/language impairment, increases relative to students of color. Thus, in the context of racial distinctiveness, student race becomes salient to sorting into special education.",TRUE,FALSE,disability|race|racial composition|special education,2019-04-15T01:55:03.242486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-15T01:54:52.775332,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,Rachel Fish,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/citation/,n6fgp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb24aeb39926900181100a7/,5cb24aeb39926900181100a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6fgp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n6fgp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n6fgp,NA

This study investigated how personality traits are related to compliance with environmental regulation in agriculture. The object of study was a water-protection rule that required farmers using fertilising to keep it a minimum distance away from nearby water bodies. Self-interested infringements can cause serious environmental damage to waters (negative externalities) through nitrogen runoff. In a survey among German farmers, we employed a 10-item version of the Big Five Inventory to measure the traits that are used as predictor variables in a regression analysis. The outcome variable was the farmers’ compliance behaviour in a business management game where rule-breaking was more profitable than rule-abidance. Some noteworthy findings were observed in the surveyed sample. (i) Neuroticism was positively related to ‘overall compliance’, measured as a binary yes/no variable; that is, more anxious farmers were less prone to rule-breaking. Surprisingly, however, a positive relationship between neuroticism and compliance was not found when looking separately at the deviant subgroup; here, greater neuroticism was associated with more severe rule violations, in terms of illicitly fertilised acreage. (ii) In the deviant subgroup, as might have been expected, higher levels of conscientiousness were associated with less severe rule-violations. Contrary to expectations, again, higher levels of agreeableness were linked to more severe non-compliance. A substantial positive relationship was found between extraversion and the severity of non-compliance, in accordance with ex-ante expectation. For openness to experience, no noteworthy results were obtained. The results indicate that agents with heterogeneous personality traits might react differently to identical economic and institutional environments. Moreover, it is suggested that, other than traits, there is another quality in agents (e.g. social control) that may have a decisive influence on their belonging to the compliant or non-compliant subpopulation. Farmers’ responses to changes brought forward by regulators who aim to prevent rule-breaking might therefore differ as well.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioural psychology|Big Five|environmental protection|nitrogen runoff|non-compliance|personality psychology,2019-04-12T16:45:28.572965,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-12T16:44:58.229745,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c64|Law|Agriculture Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/citation/,jnexr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb0aabf39926900180f4785/,5cb0aabf39926900180f4785,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jnexr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jnexr,NA
