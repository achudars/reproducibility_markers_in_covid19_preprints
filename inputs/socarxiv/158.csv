While the association between neighbourhood cohesion and mental health has been widely studied in the general population, the effects of neighbourhood cohesion across ethnic groups is not well understood. Ethnicity is often left out of study design, many studies do not consider effect modification by ethnicity, or they rely on overly simplistic ethnic categories.
 
Methods
Data from the UK household longitudinal study was used to investigate whether changes in neighbourhood cohesion is independently associated with changes in mental health (measured using the GHQ) over 9 years (2009 to 2018), and whether the association differed across 17 ethnic groups. The study used a fixed-effect modelling approach that includes within-person estimators that allows each participant to act as their own control. 

Results
Compared to British white, the following ethnic groups all saw a similar improvement in GHQ (-0.76, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.70) for each point increase in neighbourhood cohesion: Irish, any other White, White and Asian mixed, Chinese, Caribbean, African, any other Black, Arab, and others. Some ethnic groups saw stronger improvements in mental for each point increase in neighbourhood cohesion, including White and Black Caribbean mixed, any other mixed, Indian, Pakistani, any other Asian, with the strongest effect seen in Bangladeshi participants (-2.52. 95% CI -3.48 to -1.56). 
 
Conclusion
Our study highlights the importance of ethnocultural data in research examining neighbourhood effects on mental health. Future research should evaluate policies to improve neighbourhood cohesion for ethnic minorities to address ethnic mental health disparities.",TRUE,FALSE,ethnic health disparities|ethnicity|mental health|neighbourhood cohesion|neighbourhood effects|social capital,2020-11-03T06:50:42.073552,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-03T06:50:25.737031,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/citation/,uj6wa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9c58ba101721041da44075/,5f9c58ba101721041da44075,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uj6wa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uj6wa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uj6wa,NA

We examine whether previous trends in low physician voter turnout persist, contrasting to similar occupational groups and the general population.
 
Methods: Data were from the 2004-2018 Current Population Survey (CPS) November Voter Supplement, a biennial nationally representative household survey that collects self-reported or reports by proxy (household member) voting rates and behavior from congressional and presidential elections. We identified five representative healthcare professionals (physicians, dentists, pharmacists, registered nurses, physician assistants) and five other comparison professions (postsecondary teachers, chief executives, civil engineers, social workers, lawyers) selected by similarities in income or educational backgrounds. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) were estimated from multivariable logistic regressions comparing voting rates and behavior across occupations controlling for the year and sociodemographic characteristics associated with voting.
 
Results:  The pooled sample of US citizens age 18 and older (N=750,236) included 3,009 physicians, mean age 47.6 (SD, 14.9) years, 33.5% women. Household-level response rates ranged from 84%-92%. Physicians and other healthcare providers were significantly less likely to vote than comparison professions or the public after controlling for characteristics associated with voting. Compared to the public, adjusted physician voting rates were 12% lower than expected: aRR of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83- 0.92) whereas comparison professions all demonstrated significantly higher voting rates, with postsecondary teachers showing the highest rates, aRR 1.18 (1.14-1.21). Physicians were 30% more likely to vote by mail, aRR 1.32 (1.12-1.42), and 15% more likely to vote before election day, aRR 1.15 (1.06- 1.25). Physicians who did not vote or register were 70% more likely to report this was due to being “Too busy, conflicting work or school,” compared to the public, aRR 1.7 (1.36 -1.96).
 
Conclusion: Over 2004-2018, adjusted analysis find physicians and other healthcare professionals were significantly less likely to vote, whereas comparative professions were more likely to vote than the general public. Physicians were more likely to vote using alternatives to poll-based voting (voting early, vote by mail) and more likely to miss voting and registration due to work conflicts.",TRUE,FALSE,civic engagement|healthcare voting|physician advocacy|physician voting,2020-11-03T06:51:29.610894,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-03T06:50:57.136251,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.18128/D030.V7.0,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/citation/,chg26,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9c4a80101721041ea4246d/,5f9c4a80101721041ea4246d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chg26/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/chg26/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/chg26,NA

While creators often frame response videos as debates, those targeted assert that they function as vehicles for harassment from the creator and their networked audience. Platform policies, which base moderation decisions on individual pieces of content rather than the relationship between videos and audience behavior, may therefore fail to address networked harassment. We analyze the relationship between amplification and harassment through qualitative content analysis of 15 response videos. We argue that response videos often provide a blueprint for harassment that shows both why the target is wrong and why harassment would be justified. Creators use argumentative tactics to portray themselves as defenders of enlightened public discourse and their targets as irrational and immoral. This positioning is misleading, given that creators interpellate the viewer as part of a networked audience with shared moral values that the target violates. Our analysis also finds that networked audiences act on that blueprint through the social affordances of YouTube, which we frame as harassment affordances.

A growing body of evidence indicates, firstly, that their learning activities are characterised by frequent switching between academic content and online media, and, secondly, that this form of behaviour is negatively associated with academic outcomes. It is less clear, however, whether media use and media multitasking in general is associated with academic performance. In the present study we adopted an exploratory frame and a survey-based methodology to investigate this relationship among students from three countries in Southern Africa. In addition to self-reported media use measures, we investigated the predictive capacity of online vigilance on academic performance. Online vigilance is a novel construct which describes individual differences in users' cognitive orientation to online connectedness, their attention to and integration of online-related cues and stimuli, and their prioritisation of online communication. Our findings (n=1445) indicate a weak, negative association between self-reported media use measures and academic performance, as well as online vigilance and academic performance. Combined, media use and online vigilance predict 9% of variance in academic performance for our full sample. However, when considering only Namibian students (n=402), they predict 27% of variance.

Over the last two decades, significant advances in computational linguistics offer alternatives to the methods in use so far to classify languages, but less quantitative research has been devoted to long-range language relationships. Classical methods reach their limits at a level where the signals they infer are more likely to be due to chance than to relatedness. We created a distance-based method without dependency on expert judgments to set up an automated language classification inference system. We used a backward selection method to optimize the key elements of the system towards existing reference classifications: a word list, sound change rules and other parameters. We arbitrated choices in study design and features, which are beneficial for longer-range inference, if necessary at the cost of the short-range performance. The scope of the project is global: the system processes 1962 languages from all families, the limit for inclusion of more languages being the availability of the material needed by our system. After exploring the methodology, we show that it leads to a reliable language classification, matching the reference listings to a high proportion. We then apply a series of statistical models to target middle- and long-range relationships and explore connections outside the well-established classifications. By shedding light on relationships between top-level language families in the context of chance interference, our results deliver a strong support for two major long-range hypotheses: Eurasiatic (connecting Indo-European, Uralic, Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic) and Austric (connecting Austronesian, Tai-Kadai, Austroasiatic and Hmong-Mien).

We design and conduct an experiment to test the effect of ego-relevance in two types of team tasks: when contributions are complementary and substitutable. Ego-relevance is manipulated by calling the Raven IQ Test an “IQ Task” or a “Pattern Task”. We find that the effects of ego-relevance are mediated by beliefs about the teammate's contributions. Subjects act as conditional cooperators. However, the pessimistic ones contribute even less in the Ego-relevant condition, whereas the optimistic ones contribute more in the Ego-relevant condition. We do not find the nature of team production process being complementary or substitutable moderating the effect of ego-relevance on contribution decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,ego-relevance|experiment|team contribution|team production,2020-10-30T07:08:37.093511,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-30T07:07:41.542781,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be available after publication.,,available,NA,http://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=nf6ba4,prereg_designs,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/citation/,zy248,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9b7e5d10172103b6a4726c/,5f9b7e5d10172103b6a4726c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zy248/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zy248/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zy248,NA

A marketing segmentation analysis was carried out using a roster of 26 typical weekly activity items leading to the extraction of typical activity patterns and the identification of six major segments present in the Canadian adult population: ""Hygienists"" (25%), ""Caregivers""(14%), ""Sound Body Minders"" (23%), ""Home-centric"" (19%), ""Media-centric"" (9%) and ""Oblivious"" (10%). Weekly activities included a wide range of actions such as washing hands, avoiding crowds, watching T.V., internet browsing, exercising, alcohol consumption and others. The six population segments were identified using a combination of principal component and k-means cluster statistical analysis. Marketing segmentation is a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns, help design messages and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with the various societal consequences of the COVID-19 confinement.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|COVID-19 pandemic|Market Segmentation|Routine Activities,2020-10-30T07:09:01.176643,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-30T07:08:18.318675,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.fern2350.com/uploads/4/6/3/7/4637956/routine_acts_segments_v5_november2020_ed.pdf,no,Available at author's website: https://www.fern2350.com/,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health,None,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/citation/,6vumh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9b472587b7df04203b6a91/,5f9b472587b7df04203b6a91,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vumh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vumh,NA

Background: Family rituals like birthday celebrations are important and meaningful events in people’s lives, but little is known about who partakes in these in contemporary postdivorce families. Method: We assessed whether divorced parents celebrated their child’s birthday together with their ex-partner (i.e., the child’s other biological parent), current partner (i.e., the child’s stepparent), and jointly with both. Dutch Data (N=2,451) was analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Most parents celebrated the child’s birthday without the ex-partner, but with the current partner. One quarter celebrated with both. The ex-partners’ presence was more likely when parents’ and their current partners’ relationship with the ex-partner was good; and less likely when parents had repartnered and when the ex-partner had sole custody or additional biological or stepchildren. The presence of the current partner was more likely in case of coresidence with the biological parent and when the ex-partner had a new partner; and less likely when the ex-partner had sole custody and when parents’ relationship with the ex-partner was good. Conclusions: Child-related family rituals mostly involve the “new” stepparent rather than both biological parents. The effects of relationship quality, co-residence, repartnering, and having additional biological or stepchildren highlight the importance of (step)parents’ willingness to interact with each other, structural opportunities for parent-child interactions, and parents’ shifting loyalties from their ex-partner to their new family.",TRUE,FALSE,divorce|ex-partner relations|family boundaries|family rituals|parents|postdivorce parenting|stepfamilies,2020-10-30T07:09:40.621432,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-30T07:08:54.670880,FALSE,NA,no,"The New Families in the Netherlands data is stored on the DANS repository (Data Archiving and Networked Services), where permission to download the dataset can be applied for.",,no,No public preregistration,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/citation/,sgu8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7wdb6/,7wdb6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9b408f87b7df04203b5ad7/,5f9b408f87b7df04203b5ad7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgu8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sgu8t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sgu8t,NA
