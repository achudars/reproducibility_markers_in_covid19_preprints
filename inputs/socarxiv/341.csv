This paper examines one possible explanation for this penalty: the willingness to accept lower-paying jobs that have more favorable characteristics that help women reconcile family and work. This idea was formulated based on the theory of compensating wage differentials (CWDs). A factorial survey is used to empirically examine the willingness to accept lower-paying jobs. An online survey comprised 398 women who interrupted employment due to family reasons.

The securitization of cross-border mobility has been a common theme in examining immigration policies in the Global North. The securitization of emigration and diasporas in non-democratic contexts remains neglected; this is particularly true with regard to Arab states’ extraterritorial authoritarian practices. This article argues that authoritarian states develop a range of migration policies that are driven by the contradictory pressures of economic and political imperatives or, put differently, an illiberal paradox: if a state does not expect economic gains from cross-border mobility, it is more likely to securitize its emigration policy; otherwise, it is more likely to securitize its diaspora policy. The article illustrates this trade-off via a most-similar comparison of Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco.

In an effort to shift the discussion on state-diaspora relations beyond liberal democratic contexts and single-case studies, this article comparatively examines how authoritarian emigration states in the Middle East – Libya, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, and Jordan – behave towards their own citizens living beyond state borders. It identifies how each state develops multi-tier diaspora engagement policies aimed at three separate stages of citizens’ mobility: first, policies of exit regulate aspects related to emigration from the country of origin; second, overseas policies target citizens beyond the territorial boundaries of the nation state; finally, return policies set processes of readmission into the country of origin. In doing so, the article identifies similarities across disparate Middle East states’ engagement with emigration and diaspora policymaking. At the same time, the article paints a more complex picture of non-democracies’ strategies towards cross-border mobility that problematizes existing conceptualizations of authoritarian practices and state-diaspora relations.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab politics|authoritarianism|autocracies|diasporas|Egypt|Jordan|Libya|Middle East|migration|migration diplomacy|state-diaspora relations|Syria|transnational repression|Turkey,2019-07-24T13:15:23.124423,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T12:23:46.545164,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,NA,Mediterranean Politics,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/citation/,r7e3x,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xgc5e/,xgc5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d37edb9835aff001857d875/,5d37edb9835aff001857d875,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r7e3x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r7e3x,https://doi.org/10.1080/13629395.2018.1511299

While the average age and educational attainment of workers in these occupations has increased significantly since the 1970s, many of these occupations offer low wages, along with limited fringe benefits and opportunities for advancement. These occupations also employ a disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic women. Using longitudinal data from the 2004 and 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation which provide occupational data over a four year timespan, we evaluate the prevalence of occupational mobility by sex, race, and ethnicity. This research shows there are racial disparities in occupational mobility, with Black and Hispanic women less likely to exit retail and service occupations than White, non-Hispanic women. Educational attainment increased the likelihood of occupational mobility. Hispanic women’s lower levels of educational attainment depressed their occupational mobility, while longer job tenure increased the likelihood they would be occupationally mobile. Differences in human capital and job tenure did not explain mobility disparities between Black and White, non-Hispanic women.

The research constructs a model based on the available data from the database, which consists of eight independent variables, including access to fixed lines and mobile phones, household income, educational level, English language proficiency, gender, marital status, and age. Those variables are regressed against one dependent variable which represents an index of the Internet use. The OLS multivariate regression shows that the most important determinants of ICT usage are educational level, English proficiency, and age. In contradiction with previous works and findings, household income appeared to be not a strong determinant of the digital divide in 2006.",TRUE,FALSE,digital divide|East and South-East Asia|human capital|ICTs|technological inequality,2019-07-24T11:07:25.533869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T10:45:09.174508,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/citation/,ydmhg,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d372aa5835aff0017585d35/,5d372aa5835aff0017585d35,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydmhg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydmhg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydmhg,NA

This study extended the understanding of bicycle mode choice and the influence of built form through an analysis of dwelling type, density, and mode choice. Apartment dwelling and active transportation are related to intensification, but an understanding of the impact of increased density on bicycling is muddied by the lack of isolation of cycling from walking in many studies and by the lack of controls for the confounding effects of dwelling type. This study examined the relationship between dwelling type and mode choice in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In this study of 223,232 trips, 25 variables were controlled for, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimate relative risk ratios. Strong evidence was found that a trip that originated from an apartment-based household was less than half as likely to be taken by bicycle as a similar trip that originated from a house-based household in Toronto in 2011. Increased population density of the household location had a positive impact on the likelihood that a trip would be taken by walking and a negligible and uncertain impact on the likelihood that it would be taken by transit. However, increased population density had a negative impact on bicycling. Further analysis found that the negative impact of density did not seem to apply to those who lived in single detached housing but rather only to the likelihood that apartment and townhouse dwellers would cycle. Further research is required to identify the exact barriers to cycling that apartment dwellers experience.",TRUE,FALSE,apartments|bicycle|density|mode choice|Toronto,2019-07-24T11:03:46.304196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T10:05:25.251181,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,Trudy Ledsham|Steven Farber|&amp; Nate Wessel,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/citation/,nvg64,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d371272251f0e001809ac7a/,5d371272251f0e001809ac7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nvg64/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nvg64,https://doi.org/10.3141/2662-08
