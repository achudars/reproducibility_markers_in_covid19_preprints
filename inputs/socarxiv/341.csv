On attitudes towards the use of big data algorithms for law enforcement,"The use of predictive AI tools to improve decision-making in relation to crime prevention and investigation is a reality. They are being implemented almost before we fully understand how they work, while we make relevant legal decisions that may determine the progress of the technology, and long before we can predict their full impact. This paper addresses the attitudes towards this technological revolution applied to criminal justice, focusing in particular on its use by police. The first section summarises and describes the techniques and technologies that make up predictive policing. Subsequently, the main part of the study analyses the attitudes with which this technology has been received. These range from the optimism of those who defend its immediate implementation as a way to improve police objectivity and efficiency, to the pessimism of those who see its use as strengthening a dystopia of state control and surveillance. Two apparent extremes that correspond to the transition from optimism to technological pessimism of the twentieth century. The article concludes with a defence of a realistic, critical and informed view of the use of these predictive algorithms. A vision that, on the one hand, accepts that there are no neutral technologies, yet does not fall into fatalism and technophobia; and, on the other hand, places the human being and the legitimate police function at the centre of the algorithmic equation while redefining its objectives based on the scientific evidence applied to each individual technology.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithms|big data|criminal justice system|predictive policing,2020-01-13T18:01:42.460402,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-13T18:01:21.321590,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/citation/,a7juk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1c7bb26822bd00b4feddcb/,5e1c7bb26822bd00b4feddcb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7juk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a7juk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a7juk,NA

Evidence from the U.S. States, 2000-2015","Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The rise in suicide rates is contributing to the recently observed decline in life expectancy. While previous research identified a solid association between economic strain and suicide, little attention has been paid to how specific welfare policies that are designed to alleviate economic strain may influence suicide rates. There is a growing body of research that is using an institutional approach to demonstrate the role of welfare-state policies in the distribution of health. However, this perspective has not been applied yet to the investigation of suicide. In this study, I combine these approaches to analyze the association between two specific policies, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and overall and gender-specific suicide rates across the 50 U.S. states between 2000 and 2015. I estimate two-way fixed-effects longitudinal models and find evidence of a robust association between one of these policies – SNAP – and overall and male suicide. After adjusting for a number of confounding factors, higher participation in SNAP is associated with lower overall and male suicide rates. Increasing SNAP participation by one standard deviation (4.5% of the state population) during the study period could have saved the lives of approximately 31,600 people overall and 24,800 men.",TRUE,FALSE,Fixed-Effects|Food Stamps|Health|Panel Data|Social Determinants|Social Policy|Suicide,2020-01-13T01:29:41.779143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-13T01:29:15.932221,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/citation/,pnr5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/54hfv/,54hfv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1b9f916822bd0070ff2104/,5e1b9f916822bd0070ff2104,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnr5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pnr5x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pnr5x,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112778

This prediction was based on a computational model that quantified in the USA such structural-demographic forces for instability as popular immiseration, intraelite competition, and state weakness prior to 2010. Using these trends as inputs, the model calculated and projected forward in time the Political Stress Index, which in the past was strongly correlated with socio-political instability. Ortmans et al. (2017) conducted a similar structural-demographic study for the United Kingdom and obtained similar results. Here we use the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive for the US, UK, and Western European countries to assess these structural-demographic predictions.

To examine the co-occurrence of mental health (depression, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, suicide ideation) and substance use outcomes among female, male, and transgender–gender nonbinary (TNB) college students exposed to sexual assault (SA).

Methods. Data were drawn from a 2018 U.S. national survey of college student wellbeing (N = 50,438). Inverse propensity-weighted three-step latent class analysis was used to examine co-occurrence of outcomes while adjusting for 31 potential confounders of the relation between SA exposure and outcomes.

Results. Four latent classes were identified for female and male participants, and two for TNB participants, reflecting a range from low to high outcome risk. Exposure to SA was associated with significantly and substantially increased odds (ORs: 2.03–3.64) of membership to the highest-risk outcome class compared to the lowest risk class.

Conclusions. Exposure to SA in the college setting is associated with substantially increased risk of co-occurrence of depression, anxiety, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicide ideation regardless of gender identity.",TRUE,FALSE,college|depression|gender nonbinary|latent class analysis|mental health|non-suicidal self-injury|sexual assault|suicide|transgender,2020-01-11T21:02:22.831370,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-11T21:02:13.960797,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/citation/,exhqn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1a23d06822bd0040ff3b95/,5e1a23d06822bd0040ff3b95,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exhqn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exhqn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exhqn,NA

This article synthesizes existing approaches to conceptualizing legitimacy across the social sciences to identify widely agreed upon definitional properties, and builds on these points of consensus to develop a generalizable approach to operationalization. Legitimacy implies specific relationships among three empirical elements: an object of legitimacy, an audience that confers legitimacy, and a relationship between the two. Together, these empirical elements constitute a dyad (i.e., a single unit consisting of two nodes and a tie). I identify three necessary conditions for legitimacy—expectations, assent, and conformity—that specify how elements of the dyad interact. I detail how these conditions can be used to empirically establish legitimacy (and illegitimacy), distinguishing it from dissimilar phenomena that may appear similar in their empirical manifestations. I elaborate the advantages of approaching the measurement of legitimacy in this way. Followed to its logical conclusion, this operationalization has important implications for understanding the effects of legitimacy.

But how does the economic news track the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality? Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of U.S. news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households, with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further, we present evidence that this “class bias” emerges not from pro-rich journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the media’s focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the relationship between economic growth and distribution.

Yet, conventional methods for analyzing causal mechanisms are difficult to use when the causal effect of interest involves multiple mediators that are potentially causally dependent—a common scenario in political science applications. This article introduces a general framework for tracing causal paths with multiple mediators. In this framework, the total effect of a treatment on an outcome is decomposed into a set of path-specific effects (PSEs). We propose an imputation approach for estimating these PSEs from experimental and observational data, along with a set of bias formulas for conducting sensitivity analysis. We illustrate this approach using an experimental study on issue framing effects and an observational study on the legacy of political violence.

longo dos governos Lula e Dilma (2003-2015), acreditando ser a transferência de pautas
das grandes áreas programáticas do planejamento governamental para o quantitativo de
servidores ativos um indicativo da dimensão institucional das capacidades estatais. As
análises realizadas se basearam principalmente nos Planos Plurianuais (PPAs) associados
a dados dos Censos Demográficos, do Sistema Integrado de Administração de Recursos
Humanos (SIAPE) e análises das Leis de Diretrizes Orçamentárias. Os aumentos e
reduções nos quantitativos dos Ministérios foram considerados indicadores da
movimentação das áreas prioritárias de atuação do estado, associados a avaliação de sua
eficácia. Os resultados atestam que a “máquina estatal” passou por recomposição após os
cortes do período neoliberal e hoje situa-se num quadro de relativa estabilidade e até
queda em alguns setores. No âmbito do desenvolvimentismo, o Estado se situa
novamente como grande incentivador do desenvolvimento.",TRUE,FALSE,Emprego Público|Inchaço Máquina Pública|Serviço Público|Setor Público,2020-01-12T17:38:42.262366,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-12T17:38:32.332957,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/citation/,7a2gk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e18ae126822bd000dfebec8/,5e18ae126822bd000dfebec8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a2gk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7a2gk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7a2gk,NA

Employing the concept of ‘hypocognition’ suggested by Robert Levy, the author describes the search for the conceptual tools necessary to create interdisciplinary dialogue in this new research field. In addition to a brief overview of this search and the resulting discussion, the paper argues with the traditional approach to the human body and technologies as separate phenomena. As new technologies interact with the human body in new and intricate ways, and influence human beings, societies, and cultures across the world, their study must become part and parcel of anthropology, which has so far focused on tradition and paid less attention to innovations.",TRUE,FALSE,body studies|hypocognition|interdisciplinary research|technology research in anthropology,2020-01-12T17:16:22.007972,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-12T17:16:07.617304,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/citation/,afcmq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e188b7e7545840350f9c596/,5e188b7e7545840350f9c596,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afcmq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/afcmq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/afcmq,NA
