Social integration is assumed to either bring about the health effects of unemployment (causal pathway hypothesis) or shield the unemployed from such effects (buffering hypothesis). However, there is scarce empirical evidence, especially based on panel data, regarding these two hypotheses. In our analysis, we use up to ten waves of the “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS) German panel study and apply fixed effects panel regressions to account for unobserved confounders. We test several indicators that cover different aspects of social integration (numbers of strong and weak ties, conflict in the household, employed friends, general and job search-specific social support).

This paper investigates how underreporting affects estimates of the incidence and composition of poverty in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Specifically, I apply benefit adjustments for the underreporting of three social transfers to the Current Population Survey (CPS ASEC) to provide more accurate estimates of poverty rates. Diagnostic checks indicate that the imputed benefit adjustments are imperfect, but do provide a more accurate representation of household income than the uncorrected CPS ASEC data. In 2015, the benefit adjustments add more than $30 billion of income transfers to the CPS ASEC, primarily concentrated among low-income households with children. I test the effects of the benefit corrections on two conceptualizations of poverty: the U.S. Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and a relative measure of poverty set at 50 percent of federal median income. In 2015, the SPM poverty rate for the total population falls from 14.3 to 12.7 percent, a 1.6 percentage point (11 percent) decline, after adjusting for underreporting. Among children, the SPM poverty rate falls from 16.1 to 12.8 percent, a 3.3 percentage point (20 percent) decline. The percent-of-median poverty rate experiences similar declines after applying the benefit imputations. The findings suggest that the unadjusted CPS ASEC data meaningfully overestimates the incidence of poverty in the U.S., particularly among households with children. Documentation for applying the benefit corrections to the CPS ASEC is provided for improved estimates in future poverty research.",TRUE,FALSE,child poverty|CPS ASEC|income|measurement|poverty,2019-01-10T02:16:46.953088,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-10T02:16:29.982162,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/citation/,6vmws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c35c5a8804708001bf6c1dd/,5c35c5a8804708001bf6c1dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vmws/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-018-02053-0,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vmws

Temporary migration to developing countries might play a role in generating individual commitment to development, but finding exogenous variation in travel with which to identify causal effects is rare. In this paper we address this question using a natural experiment – the assignment of Mormon missionaries to two-year missions in different world regions – and test whether the attitudes and activities of returned missionaries differ.

I argue that a integration of computational register analysis and synthesis will benefit register studies as a whole, by enabling a new large-scale research program in register studies. It will enable comprehensive global mapping of functional language varieties in multiple languages, including the relationships between them.

This paper provides
an alternative and more complex genealogy, arguing instead that income accounting was born out of a governmental project, implemented by institutionalist economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) during the interwar period, to manage “the business cycle.” Bridging the literatures on the history of economic policymaking of the interwar period and the postwar triumph of “American Keynesianism,” it shows that institutionalists developed income accounting as a knowledge infrastructure to monitor inter-sectoral imbalances the generated cyclical fluctuations. Called the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) System, this infrastructure constructed “the economy” as a composite statistical object, composed of many disparate, non-fungible substantive elements that could not have been otherwise patched into a coherent whole. Wrapping these elements into the veil of money, the NIPA System became the interface through which policymakers intervened in intersectoral imbalances at the level of monetary flows with fiscal tools.",TRUE,FALSE,American State|History of Economic Ideas|History of Economics|Infrastructure|Keynesianism|Macroeconomic Indicators|National Income Accounting|Sociology of Expertise|State,2019-01-10T02:18:40.960815,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-10T02:18:15.558129,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cce|Arts and Humanities|History|United States History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",Onur Özgöde,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/citation/,gp5ju,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c350a59e8da0e001755d6a9/,5c350a59e8da0e001755d6a9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp5ju/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gp5ju/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gp5ju

Particularly within the Global South, scant work has theorised the interplay between migration and interstate bargaining. This article proposes the framework of migration diplomacy to examine how mobility features in states’ issue-linkage strategies, in both cooperative and coercive contexts.

Lippman, ""Hero of the Crossing: How Anwar Sadat and the 1973 War Changed the World""","Anwar Sadat, Henry Kissinger wrote in his memoirs, initially appeared to him as nothing more than ‘a political clown.’ This was neither the first nor the last time the Egyptian President had been referred to disparagingly. Such opinions accompanied Sadat throughout his political life as one of the Free Officers working in the shadow of Gamal Abdel Nasser and, following Nasser’s death, as Egypt’s second President. They have even endured long after his October 1981 assassination. But how did a man that Egyptians referred to as a nukta, or a joke, manage to succeed Gamal Abdel Nasser after his death in September 1970, to spearhead the 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel, to move Egypt away from the Soviet sphere of influence, and to re-align the country’s economic and foreign policies with the United States? How did Sadat achieve the unthinkable by negotiating, and concluding, a peace treaty with Israel? The constant tension between expectations and reality, or between moments of apparent triumph and despair, form the basis of Thomas W. Lippman’s recent book on the Hero of the Crossing, the name Anwar Sadat fashioned for himself following the Egyptians’ crossing of the Suez Canal during the 1973 military operations.",TRUE,FALSE,1973 War|Anwar Sadat|Arab Spring|Egypt|Egyptian Revolution|Hosni Mubarak|Infitah|Ramadan War|Yom Kippur War,2019-01-08T20:04:41.855061,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-08T20:03:47.519163,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/citation/,u7ptm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c34f9f9e8da0e001953179e/,5c34f9f9e8da0e001953179e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7ptm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u7ptm/,https://doi.org/10.5840/peacejustice201626221,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u7ptm
