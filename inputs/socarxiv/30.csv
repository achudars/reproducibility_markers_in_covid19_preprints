The constant need for communication in a scientific area to keep pace with the continuing advancements and the newly published research works, mainly in the Speech-language Pathology branch, pushes the researcher to look for the appropriate tools which bridge the gap and ease the task. The researcher tries to find out how translation can bridge the gap between the technological improvements, anglicized data, and the actual context in which the Algerian students and teachers work?  This research paper aims, thus, at researching the significance of translation from English to Arabic in an Algerian academic context (at the University of Oran 2). To reach the predetermined objective, the researcher uses of descriptive case study research in which a students’ questionnaire, a teachers’ interview, and program analysis are used. The findings show that a total absence of both the English language and translation in such a scientific discipline widens the gap between the requirements of the age and the actual practice enormously.

This study addresses the implications of this shift for the attitudes of university-level English majored Saudi students taking a listening and speaking course. The study investigated the students’ attitudes towards: a) the importance of speaking in English; b) teachers use of emails to communicate their feedback on students’ English-speaking tasks; c) online teaching of English speaking; and d) online learning and teaching of the English language. The data collection tool was a 21-item questionnaire. The participants were 18 second-year male Saudi students who were studying English at a Saudi university.

Distance Learning Experiences of Foreign Language Students at Ataturk University During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Covid-19 pandemic forced Turkey, like other countries, to give up face to face teaching in all educational institutions and to move toward distance education. This research aims to determine the learning experiences of foreign language students participating in distance education during the pandemic and their beliefs about whether it is possible to learn a foreign language without school. There were two problems that attempted to be answered; first, is it possible to learn a foreign language during and after the pandemic without being physically at school and second, what kinds of experiences do students gain in distance learning of foreign languages. The sample of the study consists of the students of department of foreign languages at Atatürk University, in Turkey. The study was carried out with a sample population composed of two hundred forty-two male and female students from German, French, and English Language Education Departments. A questionnaire consisting of thirteen close-ended questions created with a 5-Likert type developed by the researcher was applied. Participants answered the questionnaire online via Atatürk University Course Information System. The data were analyzed through the SPSS program to determine their frequency and descriptive analysis, and interpreted with content analysis and descriptive analysis. The results demonstrated that students believe that they can’t learn a foreign language without going to school.

Yet, despite the growing policy interest, knowledge about the size distribution of wealth is currently limited. In this paper we expand our windows of observation on the distribution of personal wealth using a novel source on the full record of inheritance tax files. The data cover up to 63% of the deceased population and are available between 1995 and 2016, a period of substantial economic turbulence and structural reform for the Italian economy. Our benchmark results rely on the distribution of the net wealth observed in the National Accounts balance sheets. Unlike available statistics estimated from household survey data, our results point to a strong rise in wealth concentration and inequality since the mid-1990s. Whereas the level of wealth concentration in Italy is in line with those of other European countries, its time trend appears more in line with the U.S. experience. Moreover, Italy stands out as one of the countries with the strongest decline in the wealth share of the bottom 50% of the adult population. We explore the role of household wealth portfolios, accumulation patterns during the life cycle, and inheritance flows, its concentration, and taxation patterns as main drivers of the trends observed. A range of alternative series of wealth concentration helps us better understand the role of adjustments and imputations and is based on a multi-series approach, i.e., comparing the pieces of information given by different and competing sources.

The concept of epistemic justice brings the ability to know and the right to be recognized as a knowledgeable person under a scheme of justice. It problematizes social conditions that potentially compromise the ability to share knowledge and effectuate change, and the possibility of being recognized as a knowing subject and being granted access to equitable means of producing knowledge. This paper engages with temporal aspects of epistemic justice: the role time plays in people’s possibilities to create knowledge and the way they create knowledge, the role time plays in valuation and circulation of knowledges, and the way hegemonic forms of time potentially make some knowledges circulate more freely than others. Since conceptions of time intertwine forms of knowledge, hierarchies and speakabilities of times form an immediate correlate of hierarchies of knowledge. By extension, such hierarchies feed into epistemic justice. Thus, democracy’s duty to emancipate suppressed voices requires emancipating the times from which those suppressed voices speak.",TRUE,FALSE,epistemic agency|Epistemic justice|knowledge|temporality|time,2021-04-20T03:30:23.121275,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T03:29:58.775883,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Govert Valkenburg,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/citation/,3v4z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607dd14d0c81820279518341/,607dd14d0c81820279518341,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3v4z7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3v4z7

What strategies most effectively encourage compliance with this critical covid-19 prevention measure? Relying on social identity theory, we experimentally assess two possible mechanisms of compliance, elite endorsement and social norms, among a representative sample of White U.S.–born Evangelicals, a group that has shown resistance to prevention measures.

In doing so, it contributes to an ongoing discussion on ‘What does infrastructure really mean?’ by deconstructing the omnipresent concept of ‘infrastructure’ as an expression of modernity that has crystallised a sociotechnical imaginary: a relation between technology, space and power. Indeed, our understanding of its etymological, epistemological and intellectual origins is patchy, based on repeated chronological mistakes and conceptual misunderstandings. To put it bluntly: we do not know how the word came to be. By unearthing the origins of ‘infrastructure’, this article aims to contribute to scholarly debates on the definition(s) of infrastructure in social sciences, urban studies, science and technology studies and infrastructure studies. It also wishes to contribute to ongoing debates taking place in the public sphere regarding what should count as ‘infrastructure’. This paper’s findings demonstrate a clear relation to Karl Marx’s ‘historical materialism’; the paper also analyses how the word evolved over a short period of time to become sociotechnical metaphor; finally, the paper demonstrates the emergence of a concept that linked engineering to larger socioeconomic concerns in the 1890s, well before the emergence of ‘infrastructure’ as a key concept of development economics in the 1950s.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|infrastructure|materialism|Saint-Simonianism|sociotechnical imaginaries|sociotechnical metaphor,2021-04-20T03:28:54.118121,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T03:28:13.083091,FALSE,NA,no,All data available from Google Books Ngram Viewer,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c85|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c88|Arts and Humanities|French and Francophone Language and Literature|Other French and Francophone Language and Literature|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/citation/,mx2u7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607db9560c818202725160bc/,607db9560c818202725160bc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mx2u7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mx2u7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mx2u7

First, only a fraction of the existing armed groups participates of the agreement. Second, the legitimate government fails to establish institutional presence in the areas previously controlled by those who do participate. Under these two conditions, the resulting vacuum of power may attract active armed groups who engage in selective civilian victimization to obtain control. Studying the recent Colombian experience, we find that the permanent ceasefire declared by the FARC insurgency in 2014 led to a surge in the targeting of community leaders in former FARC strongholds, perpetrated by armed groups excluded from the peace process, with the goal of consolidating their dominance in those areas. Critically, selective victimization is attenuated by some dimensions of state capacity and exacerbated in places which are more valuable as proxied by the existence of recent land conflicts.",TRUE,FALSE,Armed conflict|Peace process|Selective civilian targeting|Territorial control,2021-04-20T01:52:25.942656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T01:51:50.659092,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/citation/,st96r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607da7ef0c8182026a5179c0/,607da7ef0c8182026a5179c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/st96r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/st96r/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/st96r

Using data from multiple sources, I construct a panel dataset that includes 150 country-year observations nested in 70 countries, covering 23 years from 1991 to 2013. Through estimating hybrid panel models, this article discovers that more secular countries have lower maternal mortality ratios, higher female labor force participation rates, greater shares of parliamentary seats held by women, higher rates of women with completed secondary education, and smaller shares of the total population who adhere to inequitable gender attitudes. Moreover, from a longitudinal perspective, secularization is the only predictor of declined maternal mortality ratios and increased female parliamentary representation within a country. Interactive models suggest that further secularization within high-income nations can increase maternal mortality ratios. Furthermore, secularization’s equalizing effect on parliamentary representation moderates as countries become more affluent.",TRUE,FALSE,Development|Gender Inequality|Global Stratification|Hybrid Models|Secularization,2021-04-20T01:51:25.773249,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T01:50:57.977484,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/citation/,my6xv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607d9c5a0c818202695146ca/,607d9c5a0c818202695146ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/my6xv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/my6xv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/my6xv

We examine if COVID-19 bereavement corresponds with older adults’ reporting depression in 27 countries, and test for variation by gender and country context.
Methods: We analyze SHARE COVID-19 data collected between June-August 2020 from N=51,383 older adults (age 50–104) living in 27 countries, of whom 1,363 reported the death of a relative or friend from COVID-19. We estimate pooled-multilevel logit regression models to examine if COVID-19 bereavement was associated with self-reported depression and worsening depression, and we test whether national COVID-19 mortality rates moderate these assocations. 
Results: COVID-19 bereavement is associated with significantly higher probabilities of both reporting depression and reporting worsened depression among older adults. Net of one’s own personal loss, living in a country with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate is associated with women’s reports of worsened depression but not men’s. However, the country’s COVID-19 mortality rate does not moderate associations between COVID-19 bereavement and depression.
Discussion: COVID-19 deaths have lingering mental health implications for surviving older adults. Even as the collective toll of the crisis is apparent, bereaved older adults are in particular need of mental health support.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-20T01:51:27.946907,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T01:50:22.468576,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://www.share-project.org/share-covid19.html,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/citation/,tzm9n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/twsma/,twsma,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607d9410eb9cc9029014cf60/,607d9410eb9cc9029014cf60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzm9n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tzm9n/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tzm9n
