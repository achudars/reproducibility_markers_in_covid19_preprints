Now, the human community is struggling against transmitting disease called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease). Many countries, including China, Italy, the United States of America, Spain, France and Iran, etc. experienced catastrophic COVID-19 attack and lost the lives of their many citizens.

This paper presents a countryside discussion on the process and importance of a quick response of India as a remedy against COVID-19.

A survey experiment is simply an experiment conducted on a survey. Survey experiments address key limitations of non-experimental surveys and experiments on convenience samples. Surveys are great for speaking to patterns in a broader population, but are limited in their ability to examine causal mechanisms (i.e., what exactly causes what). Lab experiments speak to causality, but using convenience samples limits generalizability (i.e., the extent to which the patterns can be expected to apply to a wider population). Survey experiments combine strengths from survey methods and experimental methods, providing leverage on both generalizability and causality. By using population-based sampling frames from survey research, survey experiments can generalize to a broader population. And by using experimental methods, specifically randomly assigning people to experimental conditions, survey experiments can establish whether one thing causes another.

But how did the general public respond to such good news? We report results of a nation-wide natural experiment in the US and the UK on how the vaccine news influenced citizens' government evaluations, anxiety, beliefs and elicited behaviors. While most outcomes were unaffected by the news, trust in government and elected politicians (and their competency) saw a significant decline in both countries. As the news did not concern the government, and the government did not have time to act on the news, our results suggest a dispositional response to positive news more likely to be explained by a form of the psychological mechanism of motivated reasoning.

Since the increase of Bali’s tourist activities, the traditional houses for the Balinese that demonstrated not only a way of shelter but also complex cultural links have become objects of transformation. This transformation tended to fade its meanings and values, even though the Balinese have tried to maintain their culture as tourism resources. This phenomenon is an architectural challenge for the people to produce an innovative design of the transformed house. A descriptive exploratory approach with qualitative methods was used in this paper. Using interviews, field works and architectural examination in Taro, Kendran, and Ubud, this paper explores innovative designs that not only can accommodate traditional functions of the houses but also address the new demands of tourists.

We assess individual-level panel data collected weekly between 20 March and 25 June (N=2,297), which allows us to examine the risks of short-time work, furlough, and job loss, as well as changes between working on-site and from home. Using sequence analysis, we detect typical patterns of employment trajectories and analyse how these vary between socio-demographic groups. Finally, we relate the types of employment trajectories to changes in income, subjective job security (compared to values in January and February 2020), and COVID-19 infection risks. Our results show clear gradients in employment risks: low-wage workers were severely affected by furlough and job loss, while highly qualified employees were able to work from home. Furthermore, in contrast to previous crises, service sector and female employees were more affected by short-time work; however, its timing and duration differs compared to male workers in manufacturing. Income loss was pronounced among those who became unemployed and those continuously in short-term work, while everybody—including employees continuously working from home—experienced a significant reduction in subjective job security compared to employees whose employment hours or location have not changed.

In previous work, the kinetics of the groups that remain constant in their empire's nationalistic ideologies was developed. Now, this research tries to calculate how beliefs diminish until disappearing. Founded in basic historical data of two ideologies, Christianism and Sovietism, the aim of this work is to establish that the populations increase is inversely proportional to the difference between that population and the maximum Nm that could reach, dN / (Nm - N), and the elapsed time 1dt, where1  is a coefficient greater than zero. As an eternal duration is impossible, a decrement factor Nmexp (-2t) is introduced. This produces a differential equation that can be interpreted mechanically as the initial impulse that pushes and made it works. The conclusion can be desegregated in three parts: first, in terms of formal equations; second, in sociological terms, to say, religious beliefs are more important than political beliefs; and finally, in terms of political change, that is, slow transformations last very much longer than rapid ones.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-19T06:05:45.402522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-19T06:05:01.910689,FALSE,NA,no,The data to calculate the rise and fall curves correspond to the populations of territories under the influence of the ideologies understudy in several years.

At the same time, reports of non-governmental forms of disaster aid - both from organizations and among individuals - are widespread. Given that formal government programs have not fully met the material needs of many households across the United States during the pandemic, we build on disaster scholarship to compare utilization of three distinct forms of disaster support to better understand how households are getting by: (1) government safety net programs, (2) not-for-profit support, and (3) informal social support. We focus our study on a large, yet especially vulnerable and under-researched population: rural residents across the Western U.S. Drawing on results from a representative survey fielded during the summer of 2020, we find that informal social support was the most widely used safety net, with over half of all residents giving or receiving some form of informal support. However, differences in age, education, sex, race, ethnicity, and homeownership status variously predicted different types of safety net use, demonstrating the unevenness of pandemic impacts and access to relief resources across demographic groups. Finally, rural residents who experienced the worst pandemic impacts were the most likely to utilize any of the three forms of safety nets examined. Despite identified limitations to government relief, both formal government programs and informal social support systems were utilized by those most affected by the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Disaster|Informal Social Support|Rural|Safety Net,2021-01-19T06:04:41.225821,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-19T06:04:16.058224,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/64ezg/,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Kathryn McConnell|Alexis A.
