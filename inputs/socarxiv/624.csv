This American aversion to consumption taxes has commonly been attributed to the embrace of a strongly progressive income tax, perfected during World War I. A comparison of tax revenues across all levels of government, however, shows that the United States had much lower levels of consumption taxes (compared to GDP and to total taxes) than Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as far back as 1902, even before the introduction of the income tax here. At the same time, American ability-to-pay taxes (including income and profit taxes, estate and inheritance duties, and corporate license and franchise fees) remained at the low end of the Anglo-world range until World War II. The most striking difference, though, is that local taxes (essentially equivalent to property taxes) were much higher here, taking around 50% or more of total American taxes until the Great Depression but accounting for only about 40% of total taxes in Canada and roughly 15% to 25% in the other three countries. In other words, American consumption taxes (raised by state and federal governments) were so low in the first third of the 20th century not because of the income tax, but because the American state was unusually reliant on local funding. It is only with the wide-spread property tax revolts of the early 1930s, together with the growth of the federal warfare state during the 1940s, that ability-to-pay taxes came to dominate the American tax system.",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative tax systems|Consumption taxes|Fiscal federalism|Income taxes|Property taxes,2018-07-02T11:01:23.549454,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-20T15:41:10.557368,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c19|Law|Taxation-Federal|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c65|Law|Taxation-State and Local|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/citation/,f4akh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vbxaw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/relationships/node/,vbxaw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59493f5c6c613b022a736de3/,59493f5c6c613b022a736de3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4akh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f4akh/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f4akh

Electoral participation in the German federal elections from 1994 to 2013 was characterized by inertia for most eligible voters. However, one reason for dynamics in turnout behavior is changes in individual alienation with regard to the political parties. When voters develop a more favorable view of the political parties than in the previous election in terms of the parties’ generalized evaluation or perceived competence, then they are motivated to switch from abstention to voting (and vice versa). But the political parties’ capacity to raise turnout rates is rather narrow compared to the influence of other determinants, such as the perceived duty to vote.

This increase has happened alongside the declines in within-establishment occupational segregation on which most prior research has focused. We examine more than 40 years of longitudinal data on the racial employment composition of every large private-sector workplace in the United States to calculate between-area, between-establishment, and within-establishment trends in racial employment segregation over time. We demonstrate that the return of racial establishment segregation owes little to within-establishment processes but rather stems from differences in the turnover rates of more- and less-homogeneous workplaces. Present research on employment segregation focuses intently on within-firm processes. By doing so, we may be overstating what progress has been made on employment integration and ignoring other avenues of intervention that may give greater leverage for further integrating firms.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity policy|employment segregation|organizational demography|theil decomposition,2018-07-02T11:01:22.419050,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-18T22:38:35.466275,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",John-Paul Ferguson and Rembrand Koning,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/citation/,c6hsd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5jhyf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/relationships/node/,5jhyf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5946ffb39ad5a10239f71f7c/,5946ffb39ad5a10239f71f7c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6hsd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c6hsd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c6hsd

For instance, the unparticipated monad (P1), Soul, generates all individual, participated souls (P2), which in turn generate the attribute of life in their respective, participating bodies (P3). Proclus looks at (P2) as an efficient cause of (P3), where (P2) must be the attribute in actuality in relation to the attribute it brings about in (P3). At the outset, this suggests that (P2) is necessary and sufficient for (P3), which then implies a problem for positing (P1): if (P2) is doing the causal legwork for (P3), what role does (P1) play? One of Proclus’ main explanations is that (P1) is responsible for ‘unifying’ the multiple participated entities (P2), so that the commonality of the participated entities (P2) must go back to a separate source (P1). However, one could easily respond that this just amounts to a reversion to a priori Platonist principles for transcendent, separate Forms without providing a real justification for the necessity of (P1) as a cause. In my talk, I wish to elaborate on how Proclus thinks about (P1)’s type of causation in relation to (P2) and (P3), particularly showing why (P2) for Proclus is ultimately insufficient as an efficient cause compared to (P1) as the absolute first cause for a given series.
