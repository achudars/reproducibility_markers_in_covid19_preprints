We study the transition politics of the shift to a circular economy in the German packaging sector, particularly the curious case of the 2019 German Packaging Act. While the policy was born out of the unanimous wish for radical regulatory change, all actors evaluate the outcome as incremental. Following the Discursive Agency Approach and drawing upon actor interviews and documents, we show that actors’ perceived fears of radical changes are critical for transition politics. This fear created a lock-in of two narratives, proposing conflicting organizational designs of packaging waste management. While the narrative lock-in was resolved by trading radical for incremental change, it left many conflicts and challenges unresolved. Our findings suggest that actors’ fears not only prevent radical regulatory change but also create incremental change that may intensify unresolved conflicts and, thus, further weaken the actors’ capacities for future transition politics.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|discourse|implementation|policy|sustainability|waste management,2020-06-01T16:26:39.914522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T10:19:22.579575,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/citation/,mvx5q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed0d051c75686031b2d0f4f/,5ed0d051c75686031b2d0f4f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvx5q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mvx5q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mvx5q,NA

We analyze this hypothesis by examining how exposure to previous epidemics affected the confidence of individuals in science and scientists. Consistent with theory and evidence that attitudes are durably formed when individuals are in their impressionable years between the ages of 18 and 25, we focus on people who were exposed to epidemics in their country of residence at this stage of the life course. Combining data from a 2018 Wellcome Trust survey of more than 70,000 individuals in 160 countries with data on global epidemics since 1970, we show that such exposure has no impact on views of science as an endeavor or on opinions of whether the study of disease is properly an aspect of science, but that it significantly reduces confidence in scientists and the benefits of their work. These findings are robust to a variety of controls, empirical methods and sensitivity checks.

And yet conceptualizing religiosity—as a measure of intensity of religious practice—requires accounting for how respondents understand religious practice. Drawing on four waves of longitudinal interview data from the National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR), this paper examines the religious understandings of young Americans as they develop over ten years. I find that respondents’ religious understandings are shaped by deeper moral orientations that broadly structure their lives. From these moral orientations, I theorize four ideal types of religious practitioners that help explain complex patterns of religiosity in America—the Congregant, the Believer, the Spiritualist, and the Metaphysician.

The potentially far-reaching side effects of these measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N=3,504), Spain (N=3,524) and the United Kingdom (N=3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizens’ concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to estimate the consequences of the economic lockdown in terms of mental health, by predicting the level of stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find that the concern for the economy and for “the way out” of the lockdown is diffuse and there is evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety and depression, based on their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lockdown and extreme social distancing in the three countries has had an enormous impact on individuals’ mental health and this should be taken into account for future decisions made on regulations concerning the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,anxiety|COVID-19|depression|random forest|social desirability bias|stress|vulnerability,2020-06-01T16:26:31.019589,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T03:38:34.281639,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/citation/,x9m36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tbys6/,tbys6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed01cfdc7568602ea2d1ea3/,5ed01cfdc7568602ea2d1ea3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x9m36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x9m36,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240876

In some cases, unevenly distributed transit supply creates gaps in service that impede travelers’ abilities to cross space and access jobs or other opportunities. With the advent of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, however, travelers now have a new potential to gain automobility without high car purchase costs and in the absence of reliable transit service. Research remains mixed on whether ride-hailing serves as a modal complement or substitute to transit or whether ride-hailing fills transit service needs gaps. This study measures transit supply in Chicago and compares it to ride-hailing origins and destinations to examine if ride-hailing fills existing transit service gaps. Findings reveal clustering of ride-hailing pickups and drop-offs across the City of Chicago, but that the number of ride-hailing pickups and drop-offs was most strongly associated with high neighborhood median household income rather than measures of transit supply. In bivariate analyses, transit service was not associated with ride-hailing trip ends. But after controlling for neighborhood socioeconomic status, transit dependency, population density, and employment density, we found fewer ride-hailing trips in neighborhoods where bus service dominated and significantly more ride-hailing trips where rail service was prevalent. Patterns were slightly different for overnight weekend ride-hailing pick-ups, where higher transit density predicted a greater number of trips in nearby tracts. Additional research and policy is needed to ensure that ride-hailing services provide travel options to those who need them the most and fill transit gaps in low-income communities when options to increase service are limited.",TRUE,FALSE,equity|public transit|ride-hailing|transit service gaps|transportation network company,2020-06-01T16:26:39.110474,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T10:13:09.229149,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/citation/,y4jwk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed00dcd17ac9e02fe6238f1/,5ed00dcd17ac9e02fe6238f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4jwk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4jwk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4jwk,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102918

The present TSR shares that goal, and is authored by consumers and suppliers of research opportunities.  Here, the consumers are individuals in their late teenage years, i.e., late-high school (LHS) or early-college (EC), who are either considering or actively searching for their first opportunity in a research lab at a university, national lab or beyond (ANM and JC).  The suppliers are university researchers (CM and PEB), along with the views of a seasoned educator (MC).  We write this TSR for three reasons.  First, research requests have become more frequent in recent years and, while our general area has been computational biology, that’s probably secondary: the Rules articulated here may apply equally well across many disciplines.  Second, in the past decade or so there has been an astonishing increase in the intensity of HS students, on many fronts—in terms of technical skill-sets (e.g., mastery of programming languages), academic preparation and scientific sophistication (e.g., courses in advanced math), and beyond (e.g., career-related ambitions, such as searching for research opportunities!).  Finally, some of these HS students who spent time in our laboratories have gone on to productive and rewarding research careers, underscoring that this is a formative stage in one’s scientific career.  Reflecting on these experiences, through the eyes of trainee and mentor, we hope that this TSR affords some useful tips on whether research is right for you, how to go about procuring a research position, and the broader topic of navigating the LHS/EC stage of your own scientific trajectory.",TRUE,FALSE,high school|mentoring|PLOS|research primer|science education|secondary school|starting research|STEM|ten simple rules,2020-06-01T16:26:40.426334,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T10:16:20.223128,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/citation/,c7uh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecff8e5c7568602dc2d2264/,5ecff8e5c7568602dc2d2264,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7uh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c7uh8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c7uh8,NA

The case study draws on sociopolitical and sociotechnical frameworks, tracing the key historical, social, technical, and legal characteristics that have led to Russia’s successful use of disinformation and computational propaganda. This analysis demonstrates that LiveJournal played a key role in the pattern of disinformation deployed first against Russian citizens and then expanded internationally. In understanding this success, Russia has been able to transform its own domestic legal frameworks in order to prevent both citizens and outsiders from leveraging similar tactics within the country. By better understanding the role of LiveJournal in this history, it is possible to develop a deeper understanding of current active measures in Russia’s information warfare.",TRUE,FALSE,computational propaganda|disinformation|information warfare|LiveJournal|Russia|social media,2020-06-01T16:26:51.840726,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T21:40:58.106152,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/citation/,qgxef,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecfe10817ac9e02e1622db2/,5ecfe10817ac9e02e1622db2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgxef/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgxef/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgxef,NA
