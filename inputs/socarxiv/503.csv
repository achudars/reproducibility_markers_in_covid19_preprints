Therefore, the study presented vowel instruction as an intervention to address this issue by determining its effect on the spelling performance on monosyllables and bi-syllables. Vowel instruction sessions were then offered to 15 university freshman students for two months. Instructional strategies consisted of teaching vowel pronunciation, vowel letter-to-sound relationships, vowel spelling patterns, word-breaking, and providing various spelling opportunities. To measure overall spelling performance, pre-test and post-test on vowel spellings were conducted which revealed a significant increase in the mean scores. This suggests that vowel instruction was facilitative in the improved spelling performance on monosyllabic and bi-syllabic words, with more misspellings in the latter than in the former. The strategies used were generally perceived as beneficial, and it is recommended that including them in language lessons could improve vowel spelling skill and minimize English vowel confusions. Moreover, constant exposure of learners to many English words and more spelling activities are still necessary for better English vowel recognition and whole word spelling.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab learners|English vowels|spelling performance|strategies,2018-07-02T11:57:42.396751,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:31:45.417199,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/citation/,ejyqw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3rcxw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/relationships/node/,3rcxw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2deaf8d65eaa000edb6ea1/,5b2deaf8d65eaa000edb6ea1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejyqw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ejyqw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.28,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ejyqw

Screening candidates and selecting the fittest to serve as mentors is an essential process to the successful provision of the necessary professional and personal assistance to the new entrants to the profession. Based on this premise, the present conceptual paper aims to provide a new perspective to the selection process of mentor teachers to support pre-service English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers in the Moroccan context. At the current time, the only formal requirements for becoming a mentor are based on a simple expression of interest and a consideration of the academic qualifications the candidate has. This method of selection proved to be problematic in light of new empirical evidence that showed its inherent limitedness and how it created unnecessary difficulties for trainee teachers during practice teaching. The Tri-spheric Ecological Approach to Mentor Selection (TEAMS) framework this paper tries to put forward adds more layers to the screening process of mentor teachers and places it in a wider context with more important factors and players to consider. This approach is then hoped to enhance the quality of mentoring during the practicum and circumvent numerous reported problems that pre-service teachers, unnecessarily, have to endure under the current mentor selection process.",TRUE,FALSE,collaboration|mentoring|mentoring quality|mentor selection|pre-service training,2018-07-02T11:57:42.361904,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:32:09.247020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/citation/,d2c5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3ytnk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/relationships/node/,3ytnk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dea17daf8210011d42533/,5b2dea17daf8210011d42533,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2c5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d2c5x/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.27,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d2c5x

However, the impact of students’ perceived self-efficacy on their academic achievements needs more attention. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of self-efficacy on English language proficiency of students at Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. This study attempts to answer the question whether there exists any relationship between Saudi students’ perceived self-efficacy and their achievement in English language learning. Self-efficacy scales were used to gather data from 230 preparatory year students from Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Fifteen out of seventy-six sections were randomly selected from the three streams, namely, Medical, Scientific and Administration. For data analysis, descriptive statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. It is significant in terms of providing insights into the psychology of the students particularly regarding their perceived self-efficacy which will be of great help to the course designers, content developers and teachers in taking measures for the inclusion of the content to improve students’ self-efficacy. The findings show that there exists a positive correlation between General and English self-efficacy and achievements in English language learning. However, there is no positive correlation between social self-efficacy and English language achievements. On the basis of the findings, the study provides some recommendations to improve students’ self-efficacy for better performance in learning English.

The primary area of emphasis is to consider whether the use of L1 in the class reduces the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety (FLCA) or it deprives the learners of the real and constant language inputs, viz., the words of the teacher in the target language. Thus, the main research question of the study is how the medium of instruction (use/mixing of Arabic or use of English-only approach) impacts the FLCA (Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety) of Saudi adult learners. The quantitative research tool of survey has been administered on the teachers and students on five-point Likert-scale with the responses ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. There are twelve items in the survey and each item tends to explore different psychological dimension of the issue. 100 adult Saudi university students and 100 EFL teachers have responded to these items. The main finding of the study is that  learner’s L1 speeds up the language learning process in a natural way if used occasionally and judiciously with the objective of keeping self-esteem and self image of the learners intact and bringing their FLCA down.

Without effective reading strategies, students mostly face reading comprehension difficulties. This study aims to investigate reading comprehension strategies among English foreign language (EFL) learners in higher learning institutions. The study employed qualitative method and 10 Arab students of Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) and Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) were interviewed.  Inductive thematic approach was used to analyze data. The findings indicates that the most commonly used reading strategies among the EFL learners are logical knowledge (under linguistic schema), formal construction (under formal schema), cultural knowledge (under cultural schema), and prior knowledge and conceptual knowledge (under content schema). This study concludes that reading strategies help the EFL learners in understanding English reading materials. To improve reading strategies for EFL learners, there is a need for collective effort of English language teachers, curriculum designers, educationists, education policy makers, and the EFL learners themselves.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab EFL learners|comprehension|higher institutions|reading strategies,2018-07-02T11:57:42.149514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:35:39.533195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/citation/,p7cde,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m3f7q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/relationships/node/,m3f7q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2de454daf8210013d3fbc8/,5b2de454daf8210013d3fbc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7cde/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p7cde/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p7cde

However, this is not the case in Algerian Secondary school English classes. Regular observation indicated almost no continuous teacher-learner conversation while lessons. This paper intends to observe language use between the teachers and students; what instruction is used and how is it dealt with by learners. The results would aim at revealing the shortage learners show in the speaking skill and confirm the effectiveness of observation for classroom evaluation. Adopting a systematic observation, six classes at secondary school level in two different cities in Algeria were observed and audio-taped through a quantitative and qualitative method. Data is analysed from the amount of teacher’s talk, types of classroom discourse structure and questioning. Based on data analysis, the findings showed that most of the talk is approximately initiated by the teacher; learners act only when asked display questions and keep silent when are challenged by influential questions. It also showed display questions dominate the classroom for they maximize learners’ participation. Yet, this learner’ short output would limit the learners’ critical reflection and lessen the classroom interaction among participants. Therefore, this paper urges teachers to adopt a student-centred approach to FL learning that enables students’ to talk more and participate in conversations negotiating meaning with their teacher and peers. For further research, the author puts forward some guidelines to build on new research.",TRUE,FALSE,classroom discourse analysis|discourse structure|input and output|interaction|observation|questioning,2018-07-02T11:57:42.112053,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:35:56.287912,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/citation/,xnj6c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kyfv6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/relationships/node/,kyfv6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2de11cd65eaa000edb62a3/,5b2de11cd65eaa000edb62a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnj6c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xnj6c/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.20,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xnj6c

A questionnaire and an interview are employed to gather data. According to the teacher development programs offered, all universities served by the participants provide prospects for teachers to have further in-service education. In relation to professional development, nearly all participants point out a strong need for obtaining a higher degree as career advancement in their field and interestingly as a tool for salary increment. Teacher collaboration and student learning also emerge as possible factors motivating teachers to strive for self-improvement. Although undertaking research is referred to as an important and for some a required element for English teaching jobs, time-consuming nature and a sophisticated process discourage its instigation. Regarding views about quality of university teacher development, most report being satisfied with the overall universities’ emphasis on improving English teaching and learning by accentuating teachers as a key. However, teachers’ lacking motivation to progress professionally due to excessive teaching workload and internal politics embedded in some universities can be reasons preventing teachers from securing educational growth. Implications from the study shed light on the significance to support the quality of university teachers through furnishing sufficient opportunities of professional development and what Thai EFL university teachers aspire to accomplish most to develop themselves efficiently.",TRUE,FALSE,challenges|EFL teachers|needs|perceptions|professional development,2018-07-02T11:57:42.075421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:36:13.504944,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/citation/,9s35m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z48c3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/relationships/node/,z48c3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2de04adaf8210013d3f985/,5b2de04adaf8210013d3f985,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9s35m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9s35m/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9s35m
