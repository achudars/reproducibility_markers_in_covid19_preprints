To solve this puzzle, this paper examines the emergence of systemic risk and its management by the Fed since 1951. Using Fed publications, interviews with officials, and transcripts of congressional hearings, it argues that systemic risk is a pathology of the monetary government of the economy. As such, systemic risk is at once the effect of the overflow of the financial architecture through which the Fed governs and a discursive object that purifies not only this overflow but also the breaches the Fed’s emergency management strategies cause in the state-economy boundary. By turning regulatory capture theory on its head, the paper shows that the Fed put itself in such a politico-economically precarious position in managing financial emergencies because it is captured not by financial interests, but by systemic risk.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-03T19:41:12.824756,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03T19:30:44.525521,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",Onur Ozgode,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/citation/,ga5w7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2d170aa7c0a70018412631/,5c2d170aa7c0a70018412631,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ga5w7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ga5w7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ga5w7,NA

Data on 17 aspiring, 46 probable, and 16 successful SHOs were collected. The study results indicate that potential serial killers share more in common with successful SHOs than they do with one-off homicide offenders. While there is overlap among these groups, there is insufficient evidence to suggest discreet transitions among categories or that being a potential SHO is the final step on a pathway towards becoming a successful SHO. Potential SHOs cannot reliably be thought of as prospective SHOs if all things were equal. An as yet identified factor, such as resiliency, still separates potential SHOs from successful SHOs.

To do so, the development of linguistic, communicative and socio-pragmatic competences enriched with socio-cultural inputs in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) or Second Language (L2) teaching and learning contexts have a significant impact on language learners both to develop their perception as native speakers of English and to facilitate the progress of cognitive skills and capabilities. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a case study to show some of the difficulties in teaching English modal auxiliaries to Turkish students in EFL/L2 contexts which arise not only from structural characteristics, but also from insufficiently developed linguistic, communicative and socio-pragmatic competencies. It is also asserted that only teaching the lexical properties of modal auxiliaries in isolation from their socio-pragmatic and semiotic contexts alone cannot help learners to become successful communicators in the target language as it ends in communication failures, hesitation, a slower L2 progress, fear and misunderstandings. Therefore, role-play activities, cloze tests, research assignments, writing tasks and songs can also be integrated into the teaching-learning process to assist learners to become more aware of their actual authentic usages in a wide range of contexts through different activities. On the whole, this would also free language learners to refer to their First Language (L1) input and shape a broader understanding of the Foreign Language (FL) framed with its actual authentic usage.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive linguistics|competence|curriculum|language learning-teaching|modal auxiliaries,2019-01-03T19:39:22.448815,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03T19:33:56.035751,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/citation/,kxe9j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c390ea7c0a7001b3cdafd/,5c2c390ea7c0a7001b3cdafd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kxe9j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kxe9j,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.4

The subjects of this study were 100 students from different backgrounds who had been exposed to the English language for a significant period of time. They were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of a test on the use of politically correct English vocabularies and terms, and a survey of their opinions and attitudes towards the use of English with political correctness. Five of the respondents were interviewed about their attitudes. The findings reveal that students are able to identify certain politically correct words and terms regardless of the categories. Respondents also have positive attitudes and they consider this type of language as a formal and respectful language. They also suggest that this type of language is important and it should be implemented in workplaces and certain fields. However, there are few limitations of English with political correctness as it is considered unclear and sometimes it is overused. Moreover, there is no institution or academic initiative to standardize the use of English with political correctness.

The study, therefore, sought to look into: 1. what undergraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the importance of academic writing to their current study and future career, 2. what the students’ perceptions of the difficulties of academic writing, 3. what the students’ attitudes towards their previous and future academic writing courses. The present study investigates students’ needs emerging in academic writing during classroom practices to gain insightful and profound perspectives for forthcoming needs of the course. Data were collected through a five scaled questionnaire of need analysis distributed to thirty-four EFL students from a private university, and a focus group interview involving nine participants. Results indicate 61% (Mdifficulties=3.05) of students faced difficulties in both general skills and language problems of academic writing and a new course was expected to provide moves/steps for writing the sections in a research article. The present study then suggests that e-database resources are needed for academic papers models and references hence its efficiency and flexibility in prospective academic writing.",TRUE,FALSE,academic writing|EFL students|need analysis,2019-01-05T04:54:01.610130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:53:37.152613,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/citation/,g9y7r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c2dffa7c0a700193c8741/,5c2c2dffa7c0a700193c8741,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9y7r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g9y7r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g9y7r,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.31

This paper is aimed at describing the coaching materials, methods, and the effectiveness of coaching in English Foreign Language (EFL) learning to strengthen the teachers’ pedagogical competence. Six Junior High School EFL teachers of Central Java, Indonesia (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6) attended three-month weekly coachee-centered coaching leading to the implementation of student-centered learning. Observation of the teaching-learning process, review of the lesson plan, and an interview with the EFL teachers through Focus Group Discussion were done before coaching was carried out to identify the coachees’ preliminary pedagogical competence and needs. The coaching materials encompassed using songs in EFL class, learning principles and activity-based learning, teaching methods, teaching vocabulary, teaching grammar, teaching the four language skills, assessing attitude, knowledge, and skill, and process skills. Coachee-centered coaching was implemented to present the materials through such methods as Demonstration, Scientific Approach, Lecturing and Discussion, Problem-Based Learning, Task-Based Learning, Inquiry Learning, Presentation-Practice-Production.",TRUE,FALSE,coaching|pedagogical competence|professional learning,2019-01-05T04:53:47.215473,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:53:24.455612,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/citation/,xsku9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c2cc228af78001b651f84/,5c2c2cc228af78001b651f84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsku9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xsku9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xsku9,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.30

Specifically, the objectives are to describe the syntax error patterns committed by the student while engaging in speaking and to explore the contributing factors that may affect the errors. To address these objectives, a qualitative research method is employed. Data was collected through audio-tape recordings and a face-to-face interview with the participant. The recorded data was transcribed and coded based on Noor Hashim's (1996)  seven categories of errors. The findings indicate that some of the  first language (L1) negative transfer errors fall into five out of seven categories of Noor Hashim's classification; however, new categories are discovered, such as wrong verb choice, noun forms, overly restricted use of pronouns, and omission of necessary complementizers. These errors can be explained by interference from the L1 and another contributing factor is the limited use of some strategies, such as repetition and confirmation. The significance of this study is a direct pedagogical implication to expose post-graduate students to academic spoken English. This is to avoid miscommunication between students and their academic supervisors. It is recommended that future research examine new teaching and learning techniques of academic spoken English to be incorporated into the classrooms.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic conversation|Arab L2 speakers|L1 interference|syntactic errors|thesis supervision,2019-01-05T04:53:01.870954,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:52:34.763885,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/citation/,pmz52,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c2b3028af78001a65753c/,5c2c2b3028af78001a65753c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmz52/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pmz52/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pmz52,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.29
