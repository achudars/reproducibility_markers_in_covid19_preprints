Recent research indicates that these fundraisers yield inequitable outcomes, with White crowdfunding beneficiaries receiving higher levels of support than non-White beneficiaries. Researchers fear that racialized impressions of deservingness may be a driver of unequal returns in crowdfunding.  However, rather than being a direct effect of interpersonal racism, differences in returns may be an indirect effect of the systemic racism that causes the social networks of Black and Hispanic Americans to have lower access to financial capital. This paper is the first to focus on how unequal access to monetary capital in networks of potential crowdfunding donors drives unequal returns for beneficiaries. I analyze a geographically stratified sample of 2,618 GoFundMe campaigns coded for perceived race and ethnicity of the beneficiary. I estimate donor financial capacity for each campaign based on the geography of Facebook friend networks and the most likely racial and ethnic makeup of the donor pool, based on donor surnames. I show that variations in the estimated income of potential donors can account for much of the deficit in returns. Thus, even in the absence of interpersonal discrimination, crowdfunding is unlikely to yield equitable outcomes given the current distribution of financial resources in the United States.",TRUE,FALSE,Crowdfunding|GoFundMe|Inequality|Networks,2020-03-31T17:17:22.351206,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:17:04.521773,NA,NA,no,Scrubbed data available from author on request.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Mark Igra,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/citation/,g7y69,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e82d97bd0e354010eb4ca5e/,5e82d97bd0e354010eb4ca5e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g7y69/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g7y69/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g7y69,NA

We build on the sociological literature of fleeting encounters in bar settings to show how patrons’ use of these technologies augments the bar experience and shapes the social networks that may develop through interaction. Using seven gay, lesbian, and heterosexual bars located in Southern California as research sites, we describe how patrons invoke digital technologies as props to aid the impression management strategies used to facilitate new connections. Second, we demonstrate how these encounters are subject to greater relationship persistence as a result of the way these technologies are used to quickly create a shared history. We conclude by arguing that fleeting encounters are no longer connections that either persist or completely fade away after face-to-face interaction. Rather, they often persist through technology-mediated communications in ways that result in, at minimum, the development of weak ties. This greater relationship persistence can permit more opportunity to get to know a potential partner in digitally mediated settings like Facebook or via texting, but it could also require new strategies to evade interested others given this new lack of ephemerality and the influx of weak ties.",TRUE,FALSE,Bar Settings|Dating|Digital Technology|Relationship Persistence|Social Networks,2020-03-31T17:12:23.306744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:11:48.038518,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/citation/,pj2kt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e821e931ab24300f1e04000/,5e821e931ab24300f1e04000,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2kt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pj2kt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pj2kt,https://doi.org/10.1002/symb.268

Research shows that heterosexuals reproduce gendered racial hierarchies through partner preferences, yet little work examines the preferences of sexual minorities, especially lesbians. Moreover, few studies examine racial heterophily (a preference for racial groups other than one’s own), which may influence interracial pairings. Using data from 4,266 Match.com dating profiles, we find that Asian, Latino, and Black lesbians and gays exhibit higher rates of racial heterophily than do Whites. Lesbians of color are less likely to self-exclude or to prefer Whites, and are more likely to not state a race preference than are minority gays. Self-exclusionary minority daters often discuss ideal masculinities and femininities in their profiles, suggesting that such exclusions are motivated by both racialized and gendered ideals for partners.

A town hall is, after all, just a building; its walls take on meaning when people breathe social life through its doors, establish a shared purpose, and form relationships with one another. But so far scholars have not well evaluated existing theories of how digital technologies do, or do not, aid in the development of community. What’s missing is a reconciliation of contemporary manifestations of social interaction with classic sociological theories of community. Taylor Dotson tackles this challenge head-on, bolstered by a staunch critique of Barry Wellman’s theory of networked individualism, or the idea that digital technologies have transformed community life to sets of relationships are less local, more global, and centered on interests rather than local necessity. “Try getting a Facebook status update to help move a couch or stay for dinner,” Dotson huffs, in an early hook. Technically Together assembles a wealth of “technology” cases – not just digital devices or internet environs, but woodstoves, bars, cooperative business, and zoning structures – and applies a framework for evaluating whether each abets, or depresses, core tenets of community. Dotson denaturalizes assumptions of not only what counts as technologies (any structure, really) but also injects a perspective as to which are technologies of community.",TRUE,FALSE,Communication and Information Technologies|Community and Urban Sociology,2020-03-31T17:28:01.159421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:27:07.618695,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/citation/,6vfd4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e82108b1ab24300eee02cd2/,5e82108b1ab24300eee02cd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vfd4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vfd4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vfd4,https://doi.org/10.1177/0094306119828696g

Comparative ethnographic analysis of three middle schools that vary by student class and race reveals that students’ similar digital skills are differently transformed by teachers into cultural capital for achievement. Teachers effectively discipline students’ digital play but in different ways. At a school serving working-class Latino youth, students are told their digital expressions are irrelevant to learning; at a school with mostly middle-class Asian American youth, students’ digital expressions are seen as threats to their ability to succeed academically; and at a private school with mainly wealthy white youth, students’ digital skills are positioned as essential to school success. Insofar as digital competency represents a kind of cultural capital, the minority and working-class students also have that capital. But theirs is not translated into teacher-supported opportunities for achievement.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Capital|Digital Skills|Digital Technology|Education|Race-Ethnicity|Social Class|Sociology of Education|Youth Culture,2020-03-31T17:09:06.071563,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-31T17:08:21.496385,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/citation/,dpb36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e820c98d0e35400cbb457df/,5e820c98d0e35400cbb457df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpb36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dpb36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dpb36,https://doi.org/10.1086/695766

This study demonstrates how firms’ core market actions (e.g., market entry or geographic expansion) can function as CPA. We theorize two mechanisms through which firms leverage market actions as CPA—“pork” and “perk.” We document these mechanisms through an empirical analysis of data from the U.S. airline industry over 30 years (1990-2019). Specifically, we find that airlines increase the supply of flights from airports in the home district of the Chair of the Transportation Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives (pork). Moreover, this increase in flight supplies is negatively associated with formal policy changes in Congress. We also find that the airlines increase the supply of flights to Washington, D.C. from the home district of the Speaker of the House and the home state of the Senate Majority Leader (perk). We contribute to the literature on CPA by demonstrating a blurred boundary between market and nonmarket actions, which may help explain firms’ competitive actions that cannot be explained by market considerations alone.",TRUE,FALSE,corporate political activity|organizations|perk|pork,2020-03-30T13:29:21.624451,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-30T13:29:10.965580,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/citation/,7xvd3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e81e8f4d0e35400a9b47072/,5e81e8f4d0e35400a9b47072,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xvd3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7xvd3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7xvd3,NA
