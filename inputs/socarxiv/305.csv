There were a number of conditions necessary for the invention of the steam engine. A vital one was the presence of a need, initially that of how to get water out of mines and later how to drive the new machinery that was being produced as part of the industrial revolution. But needs are common and they are not always met. The reasons why those needs were met was due to the scientific progress that was going on in 16th and 17th century Europe concerning the knowledge of atmospheric pressure, how to create vacuums and of the properties of gases. Allied to this scientific progress was a belief in Europe at the time that progress could be made and problems could be solved. The inventors at the time applied scientific knowledge to solving the problems that existed and after long periods of trial and error, including the development of new and better materials, were able to produce a working steam engine. Crucial to the progress made by the inventors was the diffusion of scientific and engineering knowledge which enabled them to build on each other’s work. The earlier development of printing was important to the diffusion process and the role of organizations such as the Royal Society was also important.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|Denis papin|discovery of properties of gases|discovery of steam power|discovery of vacuums|James watt|Newcomen steam engine|separate condenser|speculative philosophy of history|substantive philosophy of history|teleological history|Thomas Savery|water out of mines,2019-10-10T18:47:42.118852,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10T18:29:00.794040,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce0|Arts and Humanities|History|Social History",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/citation/,fvs74,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9e3b8d26eb50000e7ce8ee/,5d9e3b8d26eb50000e7ce8ee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvs74/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fvs74/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fvs74,NA

However, there is no empirical consensus on demographic and socioeconomic factors driving migration decision. Exploiting micro census data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series International (IPUMSI) database across 65 countries over the period 1960 to 2012 covering 477,296,432 individual records, this study aims to establish common demographic drivers of migration. Given an exceptionally large number of observations, a parametric approach would simply yield bias estimates of standard errors of the variables of interest. We apply a machine learning technique using decision tree models to establish common demographic patterns driving migration in our data. The decision trees are applied to each country year sample individually in order to control for local optima. Resulting feature selections are compared across countries and years. We find that globally, age, education, household size, and urbanisation are important drivers of internal migration. Age and education are particularly important predictors in Europe and Northern America whilst in South and Central America and Africa, urbanisation and household size are more relevant.

Indirect reciprocity explains how social norms and moral reputations can collectively support cooperation: members of the society cooperate who others who are considered good. But the theory of indirect reciprocity requires institutions that monitor and publicly broadcast moral reputations. Here we study evolution of adherence to public monitoring in societies where individuals are, at first, independently responsible for evaluating the moral reputations of their peers. We show that adherence to a public institution of moral assessment can evolve and promote cooperation under all simple social norms, depending upon the institution's tolerance to occasional antisocial behavior. We specify how an institution's size and its degree of tolerance towards antisocial behavior can be designed to dramatically increase cooperation rates, even for social norms that previous studies have found to perform poorly. Public monitoring serves to eliminate disagreements about reputations in the population, which in turn increases cooperation and individual payoffs, so that adherence to the public institution can evolve by social contagion. Adherence is then robust to invasion, and it tends to crowd out internal mechanisms that could alternatively support cooperation. These results help explain why societies tend to elect centralized institutions to provide top-down moral governance of their individual behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-10T18:46:41.579383,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10T18:25:04.459410,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/citation/,7e4ht,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9df1b9fcf91f00111b1322/,5d9df1b9fcf91f00111b1322,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7e4ht/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7e4ht,NA

However, it is hard to measure this intangible asset appropriately. Standard economic models mostly rely on common measures such as enrollment rates and international test scores. However, these proxies focus rather on the quality of education of pupils than on the distribution of knowledge among the whole population, which is increasingly defined by alternative sources of education such as online learning platforms. As a consequence, the economically relevant stock of knowledge in a region is only roughly approximated. Furthermore, they are abstract in content, and both capital-, and time-consuming in census. This paper proposes to explore Wikipedia data as an alternative source of capturing the knowledge distribution on a narrow geographical scale. Wikipedia is by far the largest digital encyclopedia worldwide and provides data on usage and editing publicly. We com- pare Wikipedia usage worldwide and edits in the U. S. to existing measures of the acquisition and stock of knowledge. The results indicate that there is a significant correlation between Wikipedia interactions and knowledge approximations on different geographical scales. Considering these results, it seems promising to further explore Wikipedia data to develop a reliable, inexpensive, and real-time proxy of knowledge distribution around the world.",TRUE,FALSE,Knowledge Geographies|Mining of Big Social Data|Wikipedia,2019-10-09T14:42:45.707036,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:42:22.851449,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/citation/,c2gd8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9dc13bf6b03e000f1be742/,5d9dc13bf6b03e000f1be742,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2gd8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c2gd8,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67256-44

At the core of this debate is the question whether behavioural economics is shaped by large-scale content imports from psychology, or whether these transfers have been too selective to challenge dominant approaches in economics. This study contributes to the debate in analysing a variety of bibliographic data from the disciplinary boundary between economics and psychology. Two datasets from the boundary of behavioural economics and psychology are compared to sets of economic and psychology publications in quantifying the use of mathematics, the share of empirical contributions, the authors’ academic background, and their cross-citations via network analysis. In contrast to proposals made by some methodologists and behavioural economists, the statistical results confirm content transfers from psychology via behavioural economics only to a limited extend. The observed level of interaction provides evidence for a selective import of specific psychological findings by a small number of established investigators in behavioural economics. These findings were then intensively debated as divergences from rationality within the growing, but econ-centered community of behavioural economists.",TRUE,FALSE,Behavioral economics|Bibliographic data mining|Citation analysis|Economic methodology|Social network analysis,2019-10-09T14:42:05.396408,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:41:45.828132,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/citation/,83jeg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9dc014a7bc73000be7f846/,5d9dc014a7bc73000be7f846,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/83jeg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/83jeg,https://doi.org/10.1080/1350178X.2018.1511257

Following the need for monitoring shifting industries, we present a network-centred analysis of car manufacturer web pages. Solely exploiting publicly-available information, we con- struct large networks from web pages and hyperlinks. The network properties disclose the internal corporate positioning of the three largest automotive manufacturers, Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai with respect to innovative trends and their international outlook. We tag web pages concerned with topics like e-mobility &amp; environment or autonomous driving, and investigate their relevance in the network. Toyota and Hyundai are concerned with e-mobility throughout large parts of their web page network; Volkswagen devotes more specialized sections to it, but reveals a strong focus on autonomous driving. Sentiment analysis on individual web pages uncovers a relationship between page linking and use of positive language, particularly with respect to innovative trends. Web pages of the same country domain form clusters of different size in the network that reveal strong correlations with sales market orientation.

This paper seeks to determine the extent to which published CIS reviews are transparent in describing their methodological decisions. We analysed 77 CIS review articles published between 2006 and 2018. Overall, our findings indicate that reporting practices of CIS key features in extant reviews are still far from optimal. We recommend that authors better document their CIS design to increase transparency of their study and suggest to develop a uniform reporting standard for CIS reviews to assist authors, journal editors, and reviewers in their evaluation of the scientific quality of CIS studies. The list of key features identified in this study could serve as an initial framework to augment reporting standards of CIS.",TRUE,FALSE,qualitative|quantitative|reporting|transparency|trustworthiness,2019-10-09T14:39:24.201363,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:38:50.985274,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/citation/,e7g3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9dacc4a7bc73000ce84ccd/,5d9dacc4a7bc73000ce84ccd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7g3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e7g3u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e7g3u,NA

Its expression and processes are sensitive to the cultural context where it is practiced. ASEAN people, bounded by cultural and historical roots have a unique appreciation of caring but is still unexplored. 
	This paper aims to understand the concept of caring among Filipino and Indonesian Nursing faculties. Specifically, it aims to determine the unique attributes of caring thru the regional lens of ASEAN as perceived by selected nursing faculties.
	Grounded on qualitative philosophy, eleven (11) participants (5 Indonesian, 6 Filipino nursing faculties) were selected based on present criteria. Multiple in-depth interviews were done to produce the narratives of the study which were later analysed using the conventional content analysis technique.
	From the participant’s narratives, 155 significant phrases where decoded and analysed using conventional content analysis for their patterns and from this analysis, two (2) distinct caring concepts were explicated: Conscious awareness as facilitator of caring moments and mindful connection as enabler of caring.
	Findings from the analysis suggest that participants appreciation and concept of caring is grounded on the idea that genuine caring both involves intent and actions reflected by being present at the moment purposely communicating with the patient in the process of knowing. Caring is seen transcending boundaries between the nurse and the one being nursed as they continually seek meaning and being, in their dyadic synergy.",TRUE,FALSE,caring|Educator|Filipino|Indonesian|Nursing|philosophy,2019-10-09T14:37:41.894254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:37:17.530017,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/citation/,ctxj2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9d738326eb50000c79ea9f/,5d9d738326eb50000c79ea9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctxj2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ctxj2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ctxj2,NA
