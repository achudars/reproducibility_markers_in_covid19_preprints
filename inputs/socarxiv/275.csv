A survey was deployed via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) on a randomly selected sample of the inner-Sydney population (n=409). We find that less than half of the participants worry about crime but that a sizable minority (13%) indicated that they have some worry about a category of crime every week of the year or more. Building on a recent conceptual advance Grey et al 2011), we differentiate between functional and dysfunctional fear of crime. We find that greater direct and indirect experience of victimization, believing one’s neighbourhood to be disorderly, and believing that collective efficacy is low all predict moving up the scale from no worry, to functional fear, to increasingly frequent dysfunctional fear. The findings suggest gender and age are largely unrelated to worry about crime, controlling for perceptions of community disorder, perceptions of collective efficacy, direct victimisation experience and indirect victimisation experience. We conclude with some thoughts on the role of environmental cues in shifting people’s functional response to perceived risk to dysfunctional patterning of emotions in people’s daily lives.",TRUE,FALSE,collective efficacy|crime|disorder|dysfunctional fear|fear of crime|functional fear|victimization,2019-12-29T21:25:24.611125,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-29T21:25:02.794603,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/citation/,97gha,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0012b4fad251000c6f3803/,5e0012b4fad251000c6f3803,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97gha/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/97gha/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/97gha

Here, we document the indigenous knowledge of the Sheka community in southwestern Ethiopia on stingless bees. We used the snowball sampling technique to locate 60 experienced honey collectors, conducted semi-structured interviews, and complemented interviews with field observations during honey collection trips with interviewees. Honey collectors did not collect honey from aboveground nesting stingless bees, but only from stingless bees nesting belowground. To find the underground nests in the field, honey collectors used several methods, including direct observation of nest entrances and worker bee movement, attaching a thread to the worker bee, and listening for the humming sound of the bee’s natural enemy (wasp). Nests were harvested destructively. Interestingly, a single farmer kept ground-nesting stingless bee colonies at his backyard using uniquely tailored squared box hives. Collected honey is used for home consumption, disease treatment, and the generation of income. Our findings illustrate the deep indigenous knowledge of the Sheka community on wild ground-nesting stingless bees. To facilitate the establishment of stingless bee beekeeping (meliponiculture) in the study area, we may build upon this indigenous knowledge by field research on the biology of stingless bees, taxonomic studies to assess the diversity and identity of ground-nesting stingless bees, and engineering studies to develop beekeeping practices. Together, this may allow for better income for local farmers and avoid the risk of overexploitation of wild stingless bee nests.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-22T17:31:41.936659,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-22T17:31:28.655900,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/citation/,tdea5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dff7562fad251000c6e91a3/,5dff7562fad251000c6e91a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdea5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tdea5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tdea5

The publication of this essay prompted many responses, including three public letters circulated within the mathematical sciences community. Each letter was signed by hundreds of people and was published online, also by the American Mathematical Society. We report on a study of the signatories' demographics, which we infer using a crowdsourcing approach. Letter A highlights diversity and social justice. The pool of signatories contains relatively more individuals inferred to be women and/or members of underrepresented ethnic groups. Moreover, this pool is diverse with respect to the levels of professional security and types of academic institutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather, asks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of individuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at highly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically against diversity statements, calling them ""a mistake,"" and claiming that their usage during early stages of faculty hiring ""diminishes mathematical achievement."" Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories who both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly inferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities.

But many states have restricted the ability of undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licenses, making it potentially difficult for them to improve their economic standing. The effects of these laws have been tested for their association with traffic safety but not on mode choice itself. Using the two most recent versions of the National Household Travel Survey, I fit a series of difference-in-difference models to estimate the effect of permissive immigrant driver licensing on travel outcomes. Permissive licensing increased the rate of giving rides by about 13% and increased the rate of getting a ride by about 6.5%, but changes to driving alone were insignificant. Results suggest permissive licensing has beneficial accessibility impacts for all immigrants in addition to the positive safety and economic externalities documented elsewhere.",TRUE,FALSE,driver licensing|equity|immigrants|policy analysis|travel behavior,2019-12-22T01:41:22.278685,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-22T01:41:00.699316,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/citation/,sw7rp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfeab6dfad251000a6cd499/,5dfeab6dfad251000a6cd499,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw7rp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sw7rp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sw7rp

In practice, fluid processes have been difficult to experimentally quantify. Active self-concepts theoretically respond to social contexts while stable self-concepts are context-independent. Such fluctuations in ‘typical’ adults have rarely been reported. Self-concept research has broad implications; inducing and quantifying active fluctuations is long-sought-after in social psychology. However, since their inception, self-concepts were studied using bicultural participants (e.g., cultural priming experiments) and characterized in psychiatric patients (e.g., ‘fragmented self’). By increasing methodological saliency and ecological validity of popular methods, three studies tested an adapted scale and social interaction priming procedure for differentiating between active and stable self-concepts. Psychometrics, reproducibility and clinical relevance are compared to a common measure of bicultural self-concept fluidity using optimized statistics. Pre-Study controls (N=42) characterize repetition effects. Study 1: Active self-concepts are suppressed in convenience sample of 62 W.E.I.R.D. students. Study 2: Diverse, locally-representative and randomly-sampled adults (N=43) replicates Study 1 findings. Study 3: Patients with schizophrenia (N=27) hold opposing self-concepts, adopting their interlocutor’s while keeping their own. Four distinct flexibility phenotypes emerge. These studies are the first to quantify active self-concepts.
