Thus, the article explores whether social inclusivity through consumption has truly increased. This study utilises the cross-sectional time-series data of the Finnish Household Expenditure Surveys (HESs), covering the period 1966–2016. We use the Age-Period-Cohort Gap/Oaxaca (APCGO) model with logitrank dependent variables as the main statistical method. Our results indicate that an overall high income is advantageous with respect to income and spending, though the gap between high- and low-income groups has remained stagnant over cohorts. A more in-depth analysis reveals that the expenditure gap, in terms of necessities, food, and groceries consumption, has narrowed. Instead, income elastic-oriented spending on culture and leisure time has significantly increased in the high-income group, where the expenditure gap has expanded 60 percentage points over the cohorts. Simply put, expenditures on necessities have become more inclusive, but low-income groups are increasingly more ‘leisure-poor’.

Rarely do these studies present results from Central and Eastern Europe, however. Using data from the nationally representative Polish Panel Survey (POLPAN) for the years 1988-2018, we estimate the size of the motherhood penalty in Poland. We show that while mothers and women in Poland incur significant wage penalties compared to men, even after controlling for a range of productivity and human capital characteristics, mothers do not earn less than women with no children. In order to address the argument that such disparities endure because they are viewed as just, we contrast our results with those of a multifactorial (vignette) study of fair earnings. The latter shows that such wage penalties are not perceived as just. In fact, we find no evidence of perceived just penalties for women and mothers with the same characteristics as men and fathers.

As social beings, humans interact with each other, and with their surrounding environments, often through organizations and institutions. Religion and the polity are among the most influential human institutions, and they tend to impact the natural environment in several ways. For instance, several thinkers have claimed that some of the central ideas of the Abrahamic traditions, such as the concept of “Domination of men over the earth,” are among the causes of several anthropogenic environmental problems. By contrast, some of the ideas of non-Abrahamic, particularly animistic, religions are found to be associated with environmental conservation and stewardship. The polity can also contribute to environmental problems. The relationship between political organizations and environmental degradation, at any level of analysis from local to global, is well studied and established in the literature. Politicizing the natural environment, however, is not without tradeoffs. Environmentalism, by certain groups of people, is considered as a “stigma,” while it is a central concept in the political ideology of another part of the population. This antagonism is harmful to the environmental protection cause. I make the case that religion, or at least a number of religious ideas, can be conducive to the process of depoliticizing the natural environment.

These impacts can be critically higher among marginalized individuals and populations like farmers in India. While most of them live in poor socioeconomic conditions, recent psychosocial challenges due to the COVID-19 lockdown had brought endless suffering in their lives. In this article, we describe a case of suicide of an Indian farmer amid COVID-19 lockdown, who had debts and could not find laborers during the lockdown leading to a helpless situation committing suicide. In India, nearly 16,500 farmers commit suicide each year, which can aggravate if psychosocial and economic challenges like COVID-19 continues to affect them. We recommend psychosocial interventions among vulnerable farmers alongside strengthening economic support and institutional measures alleviating socioeconomic challenges and minimizing disparities in social determinants of suicidal behavior to prevent suicide among Indian farmers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-05-11T02:13:42.044128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-11T02:13:29.194314,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/citation/,ekam3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb71464a2199501515da9c2/,5eb71464a2199501515da9c2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ekam3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ekam3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ekam3,NA

We aimed to explore how social distancing measures affected recreational use of urban green space during the partial lockdown in Oslo, Norway. Mobile tracking data from thousands of recreationists were used to analyze high resolution spatio-temporal changes in activity. We estimated that outdoor recreational activity increased by 291% during lockdown relative to a 3-yr average for the same days. This increase was significantly greater than expected after adjusting for the prevailing weather and time of year and equates to approx. 86,000 extra activities per day over the municipality (population of 690,000). Both pedestrians (walking, running, hiking) and cyclists appeared to intensify activity on trails with higher greenviews and tree canopy cover, but with differences in response modulated by trail accessibility and social distancing preferences. The magnitude of increase was positively associated with trail remoteness, suggesting that green spaces facilitated social distancing and indirectly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Finally, pedestrian activity increased in city parks, peri-urban forest, as well as protected areas, highlighting the importance of access to green open spaces that are interwoven within the built-up matrix. These findings shed new light on the value of urban nature as resilience infrastructure during a time of crisis. The current pandemic also reveals some important dilemmas we might face regarding green justice on the path towards urban planning for future sustainable cities.",TRUE,FALSE,aesthetic value|coronavirus|ecosystem service|environmental green justice|mobility|open space|STRAVA,2020-05-11T02:12:41.168570,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-11T02:12:17.134637,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Remote Sensing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/citation/,kbdum,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb702d3a21995014c5d4a12/,5eb702d3a21995014c5d4a12,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbdum/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kbdum/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kbdum,NA

Yet little is known about how this trust evolves while an epidemic is underway. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of trust in science and experts in real-time as the high-impact epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) unfolds in Italy, by drawing on digital trace data from Twitter and survey data collected online via Telegram and Facebook. Both Twitter and Telegram data point to initial increases in reliance on and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities with the diffusion of the disease. Consistent with these increases, using a separately fielded online survey we find that knowledge about health information linked to COVID-19 and support for containment measures was fairly widespread. Trust in science, relative to trust in institutions (e.g. local or national government), emerges as a consistent predictor of both knowledge and containment outcomes. However, over time and as the epidemic peaks, we detect a slowdown and turnaround in reliance and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities, which we interpret as signs of an erosion in trust. This is supported by a novel survey experiment, which finds that those holding incorrect beliefs about COVID-19 give no or  lower importance to information about the virus when the source of such information is known to be scientific.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|digital traces|experts|pandemic|science|survey experiment|trust,2020-05-11T02:11:24.818548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-11T02:10:58.432347,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/citation/,5tch8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8bhn4/,8bhn4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb6b2d2a21995013f5d5d81/,5eb6b2d2a21995013f5d5d81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5tch8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5tch8,NA
