We evaluate the effect of the introduction of autonomous academies, in secondary education in England, on the educational trajectories of children with special educational needs. This has been done using longitudinal data on all schoolchildren in state schools in England, from the National Pupil Database. The results show that the effects of school autonomy on educational inclusion depend on schools’ previous performance and socio-economic composition. Poorly performing schools that obtained autonomy under the control of an external sponsor were more likely to decrease the proportion of pupils with special needs and remove additional support for them.

In politics, business and academia, renewable energy is often framed as the key solution to the global climate challenge. We, however, argue that the concept of renewable energy is problematic and should be abandoned in favor of more unambiguous conceptualization.

Building on the theoretical literature on framing and based on document analysis, case examples and statistical data, we discuss how renewable energy is framed and has come to be a central energy policy concept and analyze how its use has affected the way energy policy is debated and conducted. We demonstrate the key problems the concept of renewable energy has in terms of sustainability, incoherence, policy impacts, bait-and-switch tactics and generally misleading nature. After analyzing these issues, we discuss alternative conceptualizations and present our model of categorizing energy production according to carbon content and combustion.

The paper does not intend to criticize or promote any specific form of energy production, but instead discusses the role of institutional conceptualization in energy policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Climate change|Energy policy|Framing|Institutional theory|Renewable energy,2019-01-08T03:22:41.129157,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-07T20:14:15.026040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Atte Harjanne,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/citation/,hdb2g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3313f9e8da0e00185199be/,5c3313f9e8da0e00185199be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hdb2g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hdb2g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hdb2g,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.12.029

How short-term exposure to refugees influences attitudes and voting behavior in Hungary,"How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting and sentiment. We code exposure to refugees at the settlement level using news reports from state media, an independent online news site, and an online social media aggregator. Settlements through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee voting in a national referendum on resettlement in 2016. The effect, estimated between 1.7% and 3.6%, decreases sharply with distance from points of exposure. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition party Jobbik gained, while the governing right-wing Fidesz party lost votes in these settlements in subsequent parliamentary elections, suggesting incumbents are punished by voters in these settlements skeptical of immigration regardless of their policy position. Survey data supports this finding of a competition among right-wing parties, as individuals in exposed settlements are more fearful of immigrants and support more restrictive policies, though only if they identify as right-wing partisans.",TRUE,FALSE,Crisis|Elections|Hungary|Migration|Partisanship|Voting Behavior,2019-01-06T19:07:47.016534,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-06T19:07:10.358160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/citation/,qgpve,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c324dbb8047080018f60210/,5c324dbb8047080018f60210,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgpve/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgpve/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgpve,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-021-09682-1

The relevant literature on refugee politics has yet to fully explore how forced migration encourages host states to employ their position in order to extract revenue from other state or non-state actors for maintaining refugee groups within their borders. This article explores the workings of refugee rentier states, namely states seeking to leverage their position as host states of displaced communities for material gain. It focuses on the Syrian refugee crisis, examining the foreign-policy responses of three major host states – Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. While all three engaged in post-2011 refugee rent-seeking behavior, Jordan and Lebanon deployed a backscratching strategy based on bargains, while Turkey deployed a blackmailing strategy based on threats. Employing primary sources in English and Arabic, the article inductively examines how the choice of strategy depended on the host state’s size of refugee community and domestic elites’ perception of their state’s geostrategic importance vis-à-vis the target state(s).

I argue that economically driven cross-border mobility generates reciprocal political economy effects on sending and host states. That is, it produces migration interdependence. Host states may leverage their position against a sending state by either deploying strategies of restriction—curbing remittances, strengthening immigration controls, or both—or displacement—forcefully expelling citizens of the sending state. These strategies’ success depends on whether the sending state is vulnerable to the political economy costs incurred by host states’ strategy, namely if it is unable to absorb them domestically and cannot procure the support of alternative host states. I also contend that displacement strategies involve higher costs than restriction efforts and are therefore more likely to succeed. I demonstrate my claims through a least-likely, two-case study design of Libyan and Jordanian coercive migration diplomacy against Egypt in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. I examine how two weaker Arab states leveraged their position against Egypt, a stronger state but one vulnerable to migration interdependence, through the restriction and displacement of Egyptian migrants.",TRUE,FALSE,arab migration|Egyptian migrants|Egyptian migration|International Relations and Migration|Middle East|migration and the Arab Spring|migration diplomacy|Mohamed Morsi|North African migration|Politics of Arab migration|Politics of Migration in the Middle East,2019-01-04T19:19:21.126964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T19:19:04.075592,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/citation/,b8eak,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2fa20500b540001afec169/,5c2fa20500b540001afec169,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8eak/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8eak/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8eak,https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqx088

We investigate if air pollution is especially detrimental to the health of US state populations characterized by more inequitable distributions of income. In other words, are the populations of states with higher levels of income inequality especially vulnerable to similar levels of air pollution? We use two-way fixed-effects panel regression techniques to analyze longitudinal data for 49 US states and the District of Columbia (2000–2010) to model state-level life expectancy as a function of fine particulate matter, income inequality, and other state-level factors. We estimate models with interaction terms to formally assess whether the association between fine particulate matter and life expectancy varies by level of state income inequality. Across multiple life expectancy outcomes and additive models, states with higher PM2.5 levels tend to exhibit lower average life expectancy. This general pattern is observed with our specifications for raw and weighted PM2.5 and with adjustments for income share of the top 10%, total population, GDP per capita, median household income, median age, percent college degree or higher, percent black, and percent Hispanic/Latino. We also find that the association between state PM2.5 levels and average life expectancy intensifies in states with higher levels of income inequality. More specifically, PM2.5 levels are more detrimental to population life expectancy in states where a higher percentage of income is concentrated in the top 10% of the state income distribution. We discuss the implications of our results for future research in social epidemiology and environmental justice.",TRUE,FALSE,Health; Inequality; Air Pollution; Life Expectancy,2019-01-05T04:45:47.599800,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:45:03.739993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",The Authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/citation/,jtkhq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2f845b00b540001cfe2008/,5c2f845b00b540001cfe2008,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtkhq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jtkhq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jtkhq,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2018.100346

I combine and extend relational approaches from gender theory and economic sociology to examine how men’s and women’s behaviors shifted, the resources engendered by behavioral shifts, and how they interpreted and compensated for new behaviors and resources. I show that shifts in Syrian household divisions of labor occurred at the intersection of inequalities in social policies, labor markets, and households. As a result of limited social assistance, the refugee families needed to earn an income within months of their arrival. The Syrian men entered the labor market, in keeping with a breadwinning expectation for their labor, but could only access menial jobs that limited their time and opportunity to learn English. Women, meanwhile, did not enter the labor market full-time and could attend English classes. By observing this divergence in men’s and women’s language learning, I theorize human capital as a gendered outcome of household divisions of labor.",TRUE,FALSE,forced migration|gender|human capital|relational work|social policy,2019-01-04T15:03:47.710574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T15:03:19.149769,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Heba Gowayed,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/citation/,98fzx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2f598b18ac270016da249c/,5c2f598b18ac270016da249c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fzx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/98fzx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/98fzx,https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243218819753
