The historical CO2 emission performance data also indicate that the iron and steel, chemical, paper and pulp and cement were the top four largest industrial emitters, and these top four emitting industries contributed nearly two-third of the industrial sector‟s total CO2 emission amount during 1990-2015. Evidently, any appropriate efforts or strategies guided by an empirical investigation like this are expected to help Japan‟s industrial emitters move toward a more tolerable and less polluted carbon footprint, which is well-matched with the country‟s commitment to Kyoto Protocol. This study is thus an effort to empirically investigate the causality and long-run trend/relationship between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions and to propose some corporate environmental strategies using the econometric techniques of Vector Error Correction (VEC) and Granger causality. It found that there exists no Granger causality between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions in any direction. But the VEC estimation reveals that an increase in Japan‟s industrial production by 1% is associated with a 0.08% increase in the country‟s CO2 emissions. It also reveals that any disequilibrium between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions could take about 0.7 quarters for half of the error to be corrected for. The adjustment rate for Japan‟s industrial production is found to be positive but quite slow at the rate of 0.08% per year. Since Japan‟s CO2 emissions vis-à-vis its industrial production is found to have reached above the long-run equilibrium level, its industrial sector is expected to encounter with stricter government regulations requiring reduction of CO2 emissions to the targeted/equilibrium level in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-14T16:01:27.369118,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T15:55:00.277957,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/citation/,zb2dv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kqbr9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/relationships/node/,kqbr9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0228bd7b8c4d00189af71e/,5d0228bd7b8c4d00189af71e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zb2dv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zb2dv,NA

It is expected that the patterns of household resilience factors and adaptation practices have a strong linkage with household food security. The aim of this study was to seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the required types of support for adaptation to food insecurity among the poor and low income households in Malaysia.
Design/methodology/approach: This study was based on primary data that were collected in Jul-Oct 2012 through a questionnaire survey among 460 poor and low income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling technique. The study considered household food security as household food availability and food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to find out the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security.
Findings: The study concludes that several resilience factors and adaptation practices were statistically significant to household food security, and several external supports were statistically and significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food security programs needs to be integrated with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation programs, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial.
Originality/value: This study is a pioneer work based on primary data that empirically measured the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security in Malaysia.

The expanding role of experts and institutions in managing risks has come at a time of declining public trust in institutions and a legitimacy crisis around expert knowledge. What happens when these tendencies collide? Previous scholarship has examined how disaster arises through failures of foresight, and how cultural-cognitive biases can prevent actors from seeing disasters coming. Less is known about the mobilization of resistance against risk management policies. This theoretical essay examines a particular category of that resistance: conspiracist discourse that frames risk as emanating primarily from perceived secret agendas of institutions and experts that explicitly claim to be acting in the public interest. This essay argues that conspiracy thinking can be best understood as rooted in a “populist risk imaginary,” which is rooted in negative asymmetry, a cultural-cognitive bias that foregrounds the possibility of worst-case outcomes. Conspiracy discourse can be understood as the “dark side” of negative asymmetry, which is otherwise used by service-oriented professionals to sharpen their foresight in preempting future dangers.",TRUE,FALSE,anticipation|culture and cognition|politics|risk|the future,2019-06-13T12:03:42.928151,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T12:03:16.105162,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/citation/,7pj6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0225fd35988f0018de3baa/,5d0225fd35988f0018de3baa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7pj6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7pj6y,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12547

United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI) invites investors to consider ESG issues when evaluating the performance of any company. Moreover, nowadays the contribution of corporations towards sustainable development is a major concern of investors, creditors, government, and other environmental agencies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of ESG factors on the performance of Malaysian public limited companies in terms of profitability, firm value, and cost of capital.
Design/methodology/approach – A total of 54 companies are selected from Bloomberg’s ESG database that has complete ESG and financial data from 2010 to 2013. This study conducted panel data regressions such as the pooled OLS, fixed effect, and random effect.
Findings - Based on the regression results, there is no significant relationship between individual and combined factors of ESG and firm profitability (i.e., ROE) as well as firm value (i.e., Tobin’s Q). Moreover, individually, none of the factors of ESG is significant with the cost of capital (WACC), but the combined score of ESG positively and significantly influences the cost of capital (WACC) of a company.
Practical implications - As this is a new study on Malaysia, the findings of this study will be useful to investors, SRI analysts, policy makers, and other related agencies.

This study developed a new model of fraud risk by integrating new elements into a fraud triangle theory. This study simultaneously analyzed religiosity and the three elements of fraud risk factors of employee fraud committed by low and mid-level public officials. The data collected from 120 enforcement officers indicated that religiosity is negatively related to employee fraud. By contrast, all the three elements of fraud triangle theory, namely, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization, are positively related to employee fraud. These results imply that strong religiosity is crucial to mitigate employee fraud. To minimize employee fraud, the opportunity to commit such fraud should be reduced through strong internal control, reduction of negative rationalization, and employee financial pressure. This study contributes to the literature by introducing a new model on employee-fraud occurrence that is not extensively discussed, particularly in the context of local authority in developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Local authority; Religiosity; Fraud Triangle; Employees fraud,2019-06-13T10:31:44.869049,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T10:31:33.346721,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Terrorism Studies",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/citation/,wcyg4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/azk7x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/relationships/node/,azk7x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0221e635988f001bde7a8e/,5d0221e635988f001bde7a8e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wcyg4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wcyg4,NA

In addition, we interviewed renowned scholars in the fields of Islamic accounting and Shariah law. Consequently, this study proposes an extended model of human capital that is applicable to Islamic organizations. Apart from knowledge and competency, this study includes spiritual value as another construct of human capital in Islamic organizations. Knowledge includes ideas that are relevant to the accounting and auditing spectra, as well as Shariah principles and jurisprudence. By contrast, competency refers to the ability to innovate unique Shariah-compliant products that are rare and difficult to imitate. Meanwhile, spiritual values embrace the elements of “Siddiq,” “Amanah,” “Fathonah,” and “Tabligh.” This study affirms that knowledge, competency, and satisfaction are the most significant constructs of human capital that explain performance. Factor analysis indicates that spiritual value is embedded in and forms part of the human capital construct. Hence, spiritual value is a key element in company culture and contributes significantly to organizational success. This model can be a platform for human capital reporting in the relevant Islamic and conventional organizations.",TRUE,FALSE,Human capital; Islamic Organization; Microfinance Organization; Human spirit.|Intellectual capital,2019-06-13T10:33:29.573675,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T10:33:09.831517,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/citation/,962yu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hj5s7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/relationships/node/,hj5s7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0220c8760f110018fbe7c1/,5d0220c8760f110018fbe7c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/962yu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/962yu,NA

Historically, waqf played a significant role in the Islamic economic system, particularly in rendering exemplary welfare services in the areas of healthcare, education, social welfare, environmental, and other community-based programs. However, only a few success stories in recent history have institutionally utilized the properties of waqf under proper management to achieve its substantial objectives. This study uses the literature review as basis to analyze the reasons behind the successful utilization of waqf as an effective tool to ensure social welfare services in the past, as well as how this model can be replicated by considering current contexts. This study will assist Islamic value-centric entrepreneurs, regulatory authorities, investors, and researchers to gain an overall insight into the potentials of waqf as a tool for rendering commendable social welfare services.",TRUE,FALSE,waqf; Islamic entrepreneurship; social entrepreneurship; social welfare; third-sector economy.,2019-06-14T10:05:43.355386,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T10:05:14.752031,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/citation/,8bfjy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/267ef/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/relationships/node/,267ef,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d021fae7b8c4d00199b1f39/,5d021fae7b8c4d00199b1f39,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8bfjy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8bfjy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8bfjy,NA
