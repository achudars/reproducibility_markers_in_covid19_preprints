The second premise is that the consequences of this super-shock are asymmetric. Different types of hosts will face different types of challenges as a consequence of the sudden and unexpected drop in demand. Investors who are in the business of short term rental to make commercial profits will find themselves in a situation where they still have expenses, but no more income.

Judd's theorem (1985) that a zero capital income tax rate is optimal for workers is based on the assumption that all capital has the effect of increasing the marginal productivity of labor. However, in reality, some capital lowers the marginal productivity of labor through automation (technological unemployment). Therefore, this model assumes two types of capital. Labor-complementing capital increases the marginal productivity of labor (real wages), while labor-substituting capital decreases it. The rates of return are kept equal between the two. Using such an economic growth model, we analyze the long-run effects of taxes on real wages. Even if capital income tax is imposed, real wages don’t change because both labor-complementing capital and labor-substituting capital decrease. In contrast, value-added tax results in reduced real wages. This is because labor costs are deducted in capital income tax, but not in value-added tax. Capital income tax is more suitable for income redistribution than value-added tax. These conclusions also apply to an open economy.",TRUE,FALSE,Acemoglu|automation|income redistribution|Judd|open economy|optimal capital income taxation|real wage|tax incidence|technological unemployment|value-added tax,2020-03-19T13:01:20.732990,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-19T13:01:04.329086,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/citation/,fpdnu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e70fbc04a60a50434bb2981/,5e70fbc04a60a50434bb2981,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpdnu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fpdnu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fpdnu

In this model, the lower the discount rate or risk aversion of people, the higher the total investment. This model shows that when the interest rate is not at the zero lower bound, the total investment is only slightly affected by people's risk aversion, but at the zero lower bound, the total investment is inversely proportional to people's risk aversion. In addition, this model is used to analyze monetary policy. It is shown that the interest rate channel and the credit channel can be analyzed with the same formula and the effect of the interest rate channel is small. This explains why a central bank can greatly increase the total investment with small changes in the interest rate.

This paper seeks to gain a better understanding of this phenomena by assessing one highly prevalent global pandemic: malaria. It does so by evaluating malaria's burden on the political ties of nation-states, and on international relations more generally. We posit that malaria dissuades foreign countries from locating their envoys in malaria-affected states. As a consequence, a protracted pandemic has the potential to undermine the political ties of nation-states, as well as the many benefits of these connections. This argument is tested empirically using both directed-dyadic and monadic data. We find that malaria not only serves to discourage foreign governments from establishing diplomatic outposts, but also decreases the total diplomatic missions that a country receives. These findings thus have important policy implications, especially for developing states that seek to increase their global political impact while simultaneously combating persistent pandemics.",TRUE,FALSE,Diplomacy|International Relations|Malaria|Pandemics|Political Science,2020-03-18T04:00:29.138928,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-18T04:00:05.837762,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/citation/,zdtyx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/veny6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/relationships/node/,veny6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e70f9140cd06c0409005a77/,5e70f9140cd06c0409005a77,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdtyx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zdtyx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zdtyx

As a first step towards achieving this, the experts who participated in the scenarios and models expert group of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) entered into an iterative, participatory process that led to the development of the Nature Futures Framework (NFF). The NFF is a heuristic tool that captures diverse, positive relationships of humans with nature in the form of a triangle. It can be used both as a boundary object for continuously opening up more plural perspectives in the creation of desirable nature scenarios and as an actionable framework for developing consistent nature scenarios across multiple scales. Here, we describe the methods employed to develop the NFF and how this fits into a longer-term process to create transformative, multiscale scenarios for nature. We argue that the contribution of the NFF is two-fold: a) its ability to hold a plurality of perspectives on what is desirable, which enables the development of joint goals and visions and recognises the possible convergence and synergies of measures to achieve these and b), its multi-scale functionality for elaborating scenarios and models that can inform decision-making at relevant levels, making it applicable across specific places and perspectives on nature.

NLRB Proposed Rule Making and Student Worker Unionization Rights,"This article presents data, precedent, and empirical evidence relevant to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) proposal to issue a new rule to exclude graduate assistants and other student employees from coverage under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The analysis in three parts. First, the authors show through an analysis of information from other federal agencies that the adoption of the proposed NLRB rule would exclude over 81,000 graduate assistants on private campuses from the right to unionize and engage in collective bargaining. Second, the article presents a legal history from the past half-century about unionization of student employees at private and public sector institutions of higher education, including the NLRB’s oscillation on the question of whether student employees are protected under the NLRA. The inconsistencies of the NLRB is in stark contrast to state and Canadian provincial precedent during the same period. Lastly, the authors analyze the terms of 42 current collective bargaining agreements covering student workers, including 10 at the private sector institutions. The empirical evidence from five decades of relevant collective bargaining history, precedent, and contracts demonstrates consistent economic relationships between student employees and their institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,collective bargaining|graduate students|higher education|labor unions|NLRB,2020-03-17T16:47:48.647443,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-17T16:35:44.596501,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/citation/,beahj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6fca650cd06c037900b27c/,5e6fca650cd06c037900b27c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/beahj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/beahj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/beahj

The driving variable is the emotional state of agents, characterized by their valence, quantifying the emotion from unpleasant to pleasant, and their arousal, quantifying the degree of activity associated with the emotion.  Both determine their emotional expression, from which collective emotional information is generated. This information feeds back on the dynamics of emotional states and of individual opinions in a non-linear manner. We derive the critical conditions for emotional interactions to obtain either consensus or polarization of opinions. Stochastic agent-based simulations and formal analyses of the model explain our results. Possible ways to validate the model are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-03-16T18:11:41.803775,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-16T18:11:20.293471,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/citation/,8m2wq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6fb3080cd06c03980020f9/,5e6fb3080cd06c03980020f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8m2wq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8m2wq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8m2wq
