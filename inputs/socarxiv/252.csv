These differences suggest that independent directors could play a unique role on private firm boards. This paper explores the dynamics of VC-backed startup boards using new data on board member entry, exit, and individual director characteristics. We document several new facts about board size, the allocation of control, and composition dynamics. At formation, a typical board has four members and is entrepreneur-controlled. Independent directors are found on the median board after the second financing event, when control over the board becomes shared, with independent directors holding the tie-breaking vote. These patterns are consistent with independent directors playing both a mediating and advising role over the startup lifecycle, and thus representing another potential source of value-add to entrepreneurial firm performance.",TRUE,FALSE,board of directors|corporate governance|entrepreneurship|independent directors|startups|venture capital,2020-02-18T19:40:01.821729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-18T19:39:36.348076,FALSE,NA,no,See the Internet Appendix for details on the data construction.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/citation/,t96yq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c63pu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/relationships/node/,c63pu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4b0cedb8c2e5000f4c4d48/,5e4b0cedb8c2e5000f4c4d48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t96yq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t96yq,NA

Scenario developments in Industrial Ecology have focused on disparate components of the socioeconomic metabolism and case studies, and few efforts of comprehensive and cumulative scenario formulation are documented. Many important, empirically derived relationships between material cycles, end-use services, and energy use are relevant to global scenario modeling efforts, e.g., of integrated assessment models (IAMs), which do not routinely describe material cycles or the life-cycle impacts of various technology shifts. These inconsistent depictions of material cycles and their environmental impacts hinder the assessment of sustainable development strategies such as demand-side sufficiency, material efficiency, and energy efficiency. We developed three highly detailed scenarios covering 20 global regions to 2060 for the service provisioning of dwelling area and personal transport grounded in salient building and vehicle operation parameters. Our scenarios are based on, and interface with, the Low Energy Demand (LED) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1 and SSP2) narratives. The results comprise scenario-, region-, and period-specific narratives and corresponding parameter values, including per-capita floor space and vehicle stocks, building and vehicle archetype mixes, passenger-km, vehicle-km, vehicle occupancy rates, and implementation potentials of nine material efficiency strategies.

Our findings indicate that number of childhood disadvantages is negatively associated with work and positively with disability, irrespective of gender and race/ethnicity.

More efficient use of materials – through decoupling of services that support human wellbeing from material use – is imperative as other emissions mitigation options are expensive. An interdisciplinary scientific assessment of material efficiency and its links to service provision, material cycle management, and climate policy is needed to identify effective strategies and help design the policy framework required for their implementation. 
We present RECC, the Resource Efficiency-Climate Change mitigation framework, a first step towards such a comprehensive assessment. RECC is based on dynamic material flow analysis and links the services provided (individual motorized transport and dwelling) to the operation of in-use stocks (passenger vehicles and residential buildings), to the expansion and maintenance of these stocks to their material cycles (major materials like steel and cement), and to energy use and climate impacts. A key innovation of RECC is the up-scaling of detailed descriptions of future product archetypes with different degrees of material and energy efficiency, which are simulated with engineering tools.
We utilize RECC with augmented storylines of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) to describe future service demand and associated material requirements. Ten material efficiency strategies at different stages of the material cycle can be assessed by ramping up their implementation rates to the identified technical potentials. RECC provides scenario results for the life cycle impacts of ambitious service-material decoupling concurrent with energy system decarbonization, giving detailed insights on the resource efficiency-climate change mitigation nexus to policy makers worldwide.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change mitigation|decoupling|material efficiency|material flow analysis|Resource efficiency|scenario analysis,2020-02-16T17:13:02.101706,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-16T17:12:53.912393,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/citation/,7ubrp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e495de93e86a8019c6e510a/,5e495de93e86a8019c6e510a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ubrp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7ubrp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7ubrp,https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13023

In the analysis, we apply the statistical method of causal inference for estimating the degree of vulnerability to negative life events from cross-sectional social survey data and define the vulnerability score as this measurement of vulnerability. We analyze the SSM survey data to assess people's vulnerability in terms of household income and subjective well-being in response to negative life events, such as unemployment and loss of a spouse, and reveal differences based on gender, age, and educational attainment.

As for unemployment, we find from the analyses that both men and women who are around 40 years old and has less education face the most severe risk of damaging household income, while younger men are at severe risk of damaging their subjective well-being through the event. As for loss of a spouse, we found that women are more vulnerable than men in terms of objective well-being, while men are more vulnerable than women in terms of subjective well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,negative life event|risk|vulnerability,2020-02-16T17:07:06.358033,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-16T17:06:42.799897,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/citation/,g2wcf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e48eba4d66221017c993b99/,5e48eba4d66221017c993b99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2wcf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g2wcf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g2wcf,NA

Governments, international organizations and civil society organizations implement a variety of campaigns to counter misinformation spread by smuggling and trafficking networks. The evidence on the effects of such information interventions on potential migrants remains limited and largely anecdotal. More generally, the role of risk perceptions for the decision-making process of potential irregular migrants is rarely explicitly tested while the concept of risk pervades conventional migration models, particularly in the field of economics. We address this gap by providing causal evidence of the effects of a peer-to-peer information intervention on the perceptions, knowledge and intentions of potential migrants in Dakar, Senegal, using a randomized controlled trial design. The results show that – three months after the intervention – peer-to-peer information events about risks increased potential migrants’ subjective information levels, raised risk perceptions; and reduced intentions to migrate irregularly. We found no substantial effects on factual migration knowledge. We discuss how the effects may be driven by the trust and identification-enhancing nature of peer-to-peer communication.",TRUE,FALSE,decision-making|impact evaluation|information|migration|randomized controlled trial,2020-02-16T17:03:21.011549,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-16T17:02:59.197905,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/citation/,vjswy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e480a713e86a801676e5120/,5e480a713e86a801676e5120,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vjswy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vjswy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vjswy,NA

Please refer to the DOI for the accepted manuscript: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abc279.*** Environmental and social problems triggered by rapid palm oil expansion in the tropics have spurred the proliferation of sustainability certification systems such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). While the RSPO aims to improve the impact of oil palm production on people and environments, its effect on local development, environmental quality, and, especially, potential trade-offs between these outcomes remain unclear. Here, we evaluate whether RSPO certification of large-scale industrial concessions has promoted village development and supported environmental quality in Indonesia, the top global palm oil producer. Using a panel dataset with observations from 11,000 villages in Kalimantan and Sumatra from 2003-2014, we apply rigorous quasi-experimental methods to quantify the RSPO's impacts on village development and environmental outcomes. In the short-run, RSPO contributed to environmental conservation, but had limited development outcomes. On average, relative to villages with non-certified concessions, RSPO certification reduced deforestation and protected primary forests in Sumatra and lowered the incidence of village-reported land pollution in Kalimantan. RSPO certification also increased the number of private educational facilities in Kalimantan, but had no statistically significant impacts on other development indicators. However, the trade-offs and complementarities between conservation and development vary by slope, a proxy for ecosystem fragility and oil palm profitability. On gentler slopes, we generally find complementarities between conservation and development outcomes. In Kalimantan, certification increased the number of private educational facilities and reduced deforestation and the incidence of land pollution on slopes &lt;2°. In Sumatra, certification increased primary forests, decreased deforestation and the incidence of water pollution on slopes &lt;1°, along with a decrease in population density. Higher slopes in both locations were associated with environment and development trade-offs. We highlight the need to better understand the mechanisms behind the impacts of RSPO and emphasized how the outcomes of certification depend on the communities' bargaining power and the profitability of the land for oil palm production. Thus, we provide insights into understanding these mechanisms behind the impacts of RSPO, which is a prerequisite for improving the design of certification systems and their impacts on the ground.",TRUE,FALSE,environment-development trade-offs|impact evaluation|Indonesia|oil palm|Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil|sustainability certification,2020-02-14T08:14:43.191102,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-14T08:14:15.597274,FALSE,NA,no,,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/citation/,zrwpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e462eccd6622100e1991941/,5e462eccd6622100e1991941,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrwpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zrwpd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zrwpd,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abc279
