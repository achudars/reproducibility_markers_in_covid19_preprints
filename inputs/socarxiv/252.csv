This allows of MaxEnt to be investigated by the theory of quantum information.
MaxEnt can be considered as an inductive analog or generalization of “Occam’s razor”. It depends crucially on choice and thus on information just as all inductive methods of reasoning. The essence shared by Occam’s razor and MaxEnt is for the relevant data known till now to be postulated as an enough fundament of conclusion. That axiom is the kind of choice grounding both principles. Popper’s falsifiability (1935) can be discussed as a complement to them: That axiom (or axiom scheme) is always sufficient but never necessary condition of conclusion therefore postulating the choice in the base of MaxEnt.

Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.",TRUE,FALSE,Corona|Covid-19|Netherlands|Political Support|Political Trust,2020-06-08T18:17:08.407293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-08T18:16:52.189903,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dominikschraffdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/schraff_ejpr_replicationfiles.zip,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/citation/,pu47c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ede13948b542601218b6783/,5ede13948b542601218b6783,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pu47c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pu47c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pu47c,NA

Recent publications include valid contributions about the importance of population’s demographic composition to understand country-differences in fatalities, and some speculations about the origins of different pace and patterns of diffusion. Among them the idea that intergenerational contacts would contribute to explain the fast spread and high fatality among the elderly population in some countries. We argument that in order to contribute to the scientific knowledge speculation is not enough and acknowledge that in the absence of solid, comparable data it is difficult to bring these ideas to an empirical test. Further, we present a simulation experiment shedding serious doubts on the importance of intergenerational contacts to spread the virus on the elderly population but underlining, instead, the importance of the high connectedness within the elderly population.

This article takes the folk music club of Jinzhou Medical University as an example, and discusses its development, construction, management, function, and achievements. A few relevant events are analysis and reviewed. The folk music club was established in 2013, and a total of more than 100 members performed large-scale performances on and off campus. In addition to active campus life and enriching students 'own cultural accomplishments, we believe that medical students' specialty in playing musical instruments will also benefit their future careers. In accordance with the content of the professional courses, we have introduced concepts of context in music therapy and special lectures on music and neuroscience for our students.

Preliminary Notes on the Transition from “Solid” to “Liquid” Employment,"Critically building on Zygmunt Bauman’s conception of Liquid Modernity (2000), this research note introduces “Liquid Employment.” This concept is a new theoretical construct that aims to describe the current configuration of employment – that of over-flexibility. This over-flexibility is characterized by the loosening of the once stable institutionalized standards of work. Included here are the lesser significance of possession of educational background and scientific knowledge which conventional wisdom deems as highly significant in the supposed post-industrial society. To illustrate the point, some types of work in the digital and gig economy are examined. This essay adds another dimension to Bauman’s framework of Modernity and questions the orthodox descriptions of the labor market as represented by mainstream economics.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic Sociology|Sociology of Work|Zygmunt Bauman,2020-06-07T07:41:20.857580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-07T07:41:04.953787,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/citation/,psk5j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb810b08aad3009b43e9e9/,5edb810b08aad3009b43e9e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psk5j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/psk5j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/psk5j,NA

generalized kind of information, namely quantum information, in the end of the last century.
Quantum mechanics is the most fundamental physical theory referring to all claiming to be
physical. Any physical entity turns out to be quantum information in the final analysis. A
quantum bit is the unit of quantum information, and it is a generalization of the unit of classical
information, a bit, as well as the quantum information itself is a generalization of classical
information. Classical information refers to finite series or sets while quantum information, to
infinite ones. Quantum information as well as classical information is a dimensionless quantity.
Quantum information can be considered as a “bridge” between the mathematical and physical.
The standard and common scientific epistemology grants the gap between the mathematical
models and physical reality. The conception of truth as adequacy is what is able to transfer
“over” that gap. One should explain how quantum information being a continuous transition
between the physical and mathematical may refer to truth as adequacy and thus to the usual
scientific epistemology and methodology. If it is the overall substance of anything claiming to be
physical, one can question how different and dimensional physical quantities appear. Quantum
information can be discussed as the counterpart of action. Quantum information is what is
conserved, action is what is changed in virtue of the fundamental theorems of Emmy Noether
(1918). The gap between mathematical models and physical reality, needing truth as adequacy
to be overcome, is substituted by the openness of choice. That openness in turn can be
interpreted as the openness of the present as a different concept of truth recollecting
Heidegger’s one as “unconcealment” (ἀλήθεια). Quantum information as what is conserved can
be thought as the conservation of that openness.",TRUE,FALSE,Heidegger's Aletheia|physical entity|quantum information|theorems of Noether (1918)|unity of mathematics and physics,2020-06-06T09:09:37.114256,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T09:09:02.836735,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/citation/,pef9z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb3b2908aad30092445128/,5edb3b2908aad30092445128,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pef9z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pef9z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pef9z,NA

While some are just flâneurs taking routes aimlessly, others are stalkers with a preliminary idea about the significance of their derives. Aimless or not, the different geographies visited inevitably shape and reshape the walker’s character and psyche. This article analyzes Morrison’s latest novel, God Help the Child (2015), in the prism of the theory of psychogeography, which studies the correlative relation between psyche and geography. The article posits the question how does the novel’s protagonist, Bride, grows from a flâneur to a stalker in the light of the degrading capitalist American society and how do the different voyages out initiate her to some metaphorical voyages in, enabling her to reconstruct her identity as a black female and a future black mother. Bride’s wonderings about her identity, erased by a character called Booker, lead her to wandering to different territories (Decagon, the countryside and whisky) each of which dictates on her new ideologies and ethics, which, in turn, alter her behavior and outlook. The article evetually elucidates how the final station in Bride’s journey is a cathartic one through which she reclaims her freedom, recovers her identity and empowers herself and the black community.",TRUE,FALSE,|female identity|God Help the Child|psychogeography|Toni Morrison|voyage in/ out,2020-06-18T01:33:29.730920,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:32:53.515079,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/citation/,ayvjn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb2c4e8b542600978b9d04/,5edb2c4e8b542600978b9d04,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayvjn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ayvjn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ayvjn,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.20
