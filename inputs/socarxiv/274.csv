It is found that there are growth engines to support industrial, residential, and fisheries sectors. However, water availability will be a crucial issue that possibly bounds the growth engines. This situation is called the limits to growth archetype. Another system archetype, the success to successful, is also identified.

There is variation in the onset of change by crime type, some declining from the WHO ‘global pandemic’ announcement of 11 March, others later.

A fixed age threshold is conventionally used to separate the “elderly” from the “working-age population”, usually age 65, as this has been the age at retirement for many years before recent legislative changes raising this age in many industrial countries. One could question, however, how useful fixed age thresholds are in a context of a 5-year increase in the life expectancy at age 65 over the last 50 years. Likewise, not everyone of working-age is actually employed, although over time more and more women have entered the work force or economic downturns lead to the loss of millions of jobs. Ageing indicators therefore also require more appropriate denominators. In this paper, several alternative indicators of population aging are therefore put forward that could supplement standard measurements and applied to the US.
One of the conclusions of the paper is that it appears incorrect to assume that population aging itself will strain US health and social care systems as increasing health care costs are also driven by progress in medical knowledge and technology, costs of hospitalization and the increasing use of long-term care facilities. Moreover, since 1970 economic output, and even tax revenue, increased much faster than the proportion elderly (even in terms of the standard definition, i.e. ages 65+), despite economic downturns producing temporal declines.",TRUE,FALSE,Ageing|Economic measures of aging|Life expectancy|Measures of population aging|Time to Death|United States,2020-05-12T16:49:22.275171,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-12T16:35:36.803231,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/citation/,vuaed,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebab41a9f8962000e4d2e75/,5ebab41a9f8962000e4d2e75,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuaed/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vuaed/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vuaed

Several lines of evidence suggest that advances in infectious diseases control facilitate the development of major urban centers, global high-speed transportation, industrial animal farming and ecosystem destruction. In turn, all of these are well known to favor such diseases, thus reproducing the same kind of dynamic observed in resource consumption and known as Jevons’ paradox. Such economic developments compel health systems to develop continuously just to maintain what had already been achieved, which, furthermore, becomes more difficult under neoliberal policies. The process involves massive cost-shifting to society from firms in, e.g., the aviation or meat sector, which materializes intermittently in disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A proposal is presented to prevent comparable events in the future, with two parts. First, a global fund with base funding from an internationally-agreed tax on aviation, devoted to upgrading health systems and to programs to tackle sources of emerging infectious diseases, especially wild animal trade. Second and no less important, a global agreement to fundamentally transform agri-food systems.

Further, childhood living conditions also exert lasting effects on the health of adults.  However, studies on changes in one’s socioeconomic position over the life course rarely find important effects of social mobility for individual health and wellbeing.  Such studies always draw on objective measures of social mobility and do not consider subjective appraisals of social mobility by individuals themselves. Using cross-sectional, representative German survey data, we explore the question as to how subjective perceptions as opposed to objective accounts of occupational status mobility affect five self-reported health and wellbeing outcomes differently.  We show that objective and subjective accounts of social mobility overlap, yet this association is far from perfect.  Further, there are relatively small associations between objective and subjective mobility accounts and health outcomes.  Associations between subjective mobility perceptions and health outcomes are intriguingly independent of objective social mobility trajectories.

A Case Study on the General Data Protection Regulation,"In recent years, data have become part and parcel of contemporary capitalism. This created tensions between the growing demand for personal data and the fundamental right to data protection. Against this background, the EU’s adoption of the general data protection regulation (GDPR) poses a puzzle. Why did the EU adopt a regulation that strengthens data protection despite intensive lobbying by powerful business groups? We make two arguments to explain this outcome. First, we use process tracing to show how institutional legacies triggered and structured the policy-formulation process by strengthening the position of data protection advocates within the Commission. Second, we use discourse network analysis to show that the Snowden revelations fundamentally changed the discursive and coalitional dynamics during the decision-making stage, ‘saving’ the GDPR from being watered down. Our paper contributes to the literature on the political economy of data protection while also offering a comprehensive explanation

Concurrently, the majority of the nation’s poor also live in suburbs. These trends suggest that the diversification of suburbs has immense consequences for the geography of racial (in)equality. Using Census data, we ask whether racial residential diversification and integration disproportionately occur in advantaged or disadvantaged suburban contexts. We conceptualize diversity as the racial and ethnic composition of a place; a suburb is highly diverse if it contains multiple racialized groups represented in equal proportions. We conceptualize integration as the spatial arrangements of racialized groups—a place is integrated when different racialized groups live near each other. We find that suburbs with higher levels of racial diversity are more disadvantaged than more racially homogeneous places. At the same time, integrated suburbs are substantially more advantaged than the average suburb independent of levels of diversity. This work contributes to a nascent critical research agenda on racial processes in U.S. suburbs by providing insight into the socioeconomic conditions and potential outcomes of racial diversification and integration.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity|race and ethnicity|racial inequality|residential integration|suburbs,2020-05-12T16:48:02.069281,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-12T16:33:44.728146,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/citation/,hncu8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb9c564877c5e01e13a2fbb/,5eb9c564877c5e01e13a2fbb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hncu8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hncu8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hncu8
