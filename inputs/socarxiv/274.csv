I suggest that patterns of media coverage inform public consciousness and collective emotion. Newsworthiness and gatekeeping theories assert that school or prejudicial shootings and those with more victims are reported on at higher rates. Literature on racial and immigrant bias in media demonstrates that non-white shooters also generate more discourse. The directed construction of shootings and the affective public responses they generate align well with the concept of a “moral panic.” Using all valid cases from the Mother Jones Mass Shootings:1982-2019 dataset which align temporally with Google Trends data, I analyze the volume and decay rate of search topics “mass shooting,” “gun control,” and “open carry,” following US mass shootings from 2004-2019. Shootings with more victims predict a higher volume of searches for “mass shooting,” and shorter search periods for “gun control” and “open carry.” Shootings with educational and religious targets had no significant effects on search patterns. Workplace shootings result in longer search periods for “mass shooting,” and shorter periods for “gun control.” Non-white shooters generate shorter search decay for “open carry.” The results support theories of media gatekeeping, suggesting events with more casualties generate more intense public attention. The consistent negative correlation between search volume and decay length suggests that sensational responses to shootings are not sustainable over long periods of time and prohibit pragmatically addressing mass shootings.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-28T16:32:44.845596,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-28T16:32:32.884815,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/citation/,dxkt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e038db70236b8000b7c54fa/,5e038db70236b8000b7c54fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dxkt6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dxkt6,NA

Until now, polarization research has mainly focused on opinion extremeness, disregarding the correlation between different policy issues. We explain the emergence of hyperpolarization, i.e., the combination of extremeness and correlation between issues, by developing Weighted Balance Theory (WBT), a new theory of opinion formation. WBT extends Heider's cognitive balance theory to encompass multiple weighted attitudes. We validate WBT on empirical data from the 2016 National Election Survey. Furthermore, we develop an opinion dynamics model based on WBT, which, for the first time, is able to generate hyperpolarization and to explain the link between affective and opinion polarization. In addition, our theory encompasses other phenomena of opinion dynamics, including mono-polarization and backfire effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-Based Modeling|Balance Theory|Opinion Dynamics|Polarization,2019-12-28T16:32:06.231120,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-28T16:31:50.417530,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/citation/,weg67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0339430236b8000978663a/,5e0339430236b8000978663a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/weg67/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/weg67,NA

Using Scopus to Map the Literature at the Intersection Between Artificial Intelligence and Research on Crime,"Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has spread over many scientific disciplines. Scientists have tested the power of intelligent algorithms developed to predict (or learn from) natural, physical and social phenomena. This also applies to crime-related research problems. Nonetheless, studies that map the current state of the art at the intersection between AI and crime are lacking. What are the current research trends in terms of topics in this area? What is the structure of scientific collaboration when considering works investigating criminal issues using machine learning, deep learning, and AI in general? What are the most active countries in this specific scientific sphere? Using data retrieved from the Scopus database, this work quantitatively analyzes 692 published works at the intersection between AI and crime employing network science to respond to these questions. Results show that researchers are mainly focusing on cyber-related criminal topics and that relevant themes such as algorithmic discrimination, fairness, and ethics are considerably overlooked. Furthermore, data highlight the extremely disconnected structure of co-authorship networks. Such disconnectedness may represent a substantial obstacle to a more solid community of scientists interested in these topics. Additionally, the graph of scientific collaboration indicates that countries that are more prone to engage in international partnerships are generally less central in the network. This means that scholars working in highly productive countries (e.g. the United States, China) tend to mostly collaborate domestically.

This chapter attempts to understand what is driving this uncharacteristic focus on the Navy, concentrating on developments in the 20-year period since the end of the Cold War (1991–2011). The analysis proceeds in two parts. The first section examines several different measures, including number of ships, aggregate tonnage, number of missile cells and budgetary allocation to understand the trajectory of the Indian Navy over the past 20 years. Section two examines three oft-cited justifications for naval expansion – defence against hostile maritime powers, the cultivation of power projection capability to further India’s political interests, and the protection of trade – in relation to the fleet’s actual platform acquisitions to determine their relative importance in driving naval development. The available data suggests that the primary mission driving naval modernization is sea-lane security, with the development of ‘softer’ aspects of power projection capability receiving some support, while the need to deter hostile maritime powers does little to explain India’s recent naval modernization. This focus on enhancing India’s ability to provide regional ‘public goods,’ such as sea-lane security and humanitarian response, strongly suggests that this growing naval strength can emerge as a net positive for the region.",TRUE,FALSE,India|Indo-Pacific|navy|power projection|seapower,2019-12-23T17:31:21.343678,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-23T17:30:43.371606,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/citation/,8xf7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e00641afad25100096daa31/,5e00641afad25100096daa31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xf7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xf7y,NA

potential for and limitations of U.S. and Indian cooperation in the region to achieve
shared aims. It argues that extensive diplomatic consultations between the two
countries have led to a significant convergence in their positions on regional
security challenges. Active cooperation, however, remains constrained by a
number of factors, including India’s need to prioritize foreign policy challenges
closer to home, concerns about provoking China, and a discomfort among countries
in Southeast Asia regarding the idea of a joint U.S.-India approach toward the

unprecedentedly close consultation on regional security issues. Will this consultation
mature into active cooperation? To answer this question, this introductory essay first
examines the concept of strategic partnerships—a nebulous type of political
relationship that have proliferated since the end of the Cold War. It then highlights
the obstacles to peacetime cooperation between major powers in other regions of the world. Following this, attention turns to the articles in this special issue which
examine the history of Indo-U.S. cooperation in various sub-regions of Asia.

country’s policies and past behavior, as well as identify the differing understandings
of both the bilateral relationship and the region held by each party. Taken together,
these articles provide a clearer sense of the geopolitical scope and depth, as well as

large part because the indiscriminate and heavy-handed tactics employed by the
country’s national police force, the Philippine Constabulary (PC), was a leading
factor driving support for the Huk movement. A key turning point in the campaign
came with the reform and reorganization of the PC, as a result of which the bulk of
the PC’s personnel were transferred into the Army, which was given the lead for the
COIN campaign. Although the idea of a military-led COIN campaign, with the police
in a supporting role, would appear to run counter to the assumptions that inspired

Recent research points to the incentive structures faced by differentially positioned members of a parliamentary party: unlike backbenchers, MPs who hold a ministerial portfolio can use the prerequisites of executive office to shield themselves from the costs of governance. This article tests the theory of executive particularism by examining the electoral fortunes of government ministers in India. Sitting government ministers are found to outperform other candidates, however, tests of causality fail to demonstrate that holding a ministerial portfolio causes this electoral benefit. Instead, it appears that a candidate’s electoral performance enhances the likelihood of being granted a ministerial portfolio in the first place. This finding raises questions about the generalizability of claims that party elites can use ministerial office to shield themselves from the costs of governing.",TRUE,FALSE,elections|executive particularism|India|minister|parliament,2019-12-23T17:34:41.591282,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-23T17:33:53.263081,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/citation/,j46fv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e00668ffad251000c6f8875/,5e00668ffad251000c6f8875,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j46fv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j46fv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j46fv,NA

We recommend a standardized, comprehensive and validated set of 12 ‘core’ survey items to measure public attitudes towards the police. Police services across Canada can use them to capture public opinion in a way that is comparable between jurisdictions and track change over time. We also recommend a supplementary set of measures of socio-demographics, police-citizen contact, victimization experience, perceived safety and perceived disorder.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|legitimacy|police|trust,2019-12-25T04:50:01.742459,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-25T04:49:46.888937,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/citation/,2dh5s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0015c5a95d73000a3e20f7/,5e0015c5a95d73000a3e20f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dh5s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2dh5s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2dh5s,NA
