Archaeology, and classical archaeology in particular, has long engaged with questions of the formation and lived experience of towns and cities. Such studies might draw on evidence of local topography, the arrangement of the built environment, and the placement of architectural details, monuments and inscriptions (e.g. Johnson and Millett 2012). Fundamental to the continued development of these studies is the growing body of evidence emerging from new excavations. Digital techniques for recording evidence “on the ground,” notably SFM (structure from motion aka close range photogrammetry) for the creation of detailed 3D models and for scene-level modeling in 3D have advanced rapidly in recent years. These parallel developments have opened the door for approaches to the study of the creation and experience of urban space driven by a combination of scene-level reconstruction models (van Roode et al. 2012, Paliou et al. 2011, Paliou 2013) explicitly combined with detailed SFM or scanning based 3D models representing stratigraphic evidence. It is essential to understand the subtle but crucial impact of the design of the user interface on the interpretation of these models. In this paper we focus on the impact of design choices for the user interface, and make connections between design choices and the broader discourse in archaeological theory surrounding the practice of the creation and consumption of archaeological knowledge. As a case in point we take the prototype interface being developed within the Gabii Project for the publication of the Tincu House. In discussing our own evolving practices in engagement with the archaeological record created at Gabii, we highlight some of the challenges of undertaking theoretically-situated user interface design, and their implications for the publication and study of archaeological materials.",TRUE,FALSE,3D|archaeology|design|digital publication|remote sensing|structure from motion,2018-07-02T10:58:13.449038,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T12:47:00.679907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/citation/,pqx4j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eypv6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/relationships/node/,eypv6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c16bc9ad5a10048266845/,592c16bc9ad5a10048266845,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pqx4j/,https://doi.org/10.1515/opar-2015-0017,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pqx4j

It is clear that many of the primary centers of narcotics cultivation and transport have also experienced endemic looting of archaeological sites (e.g., Afghanistan, the Andes, Central America, and Southeast Asia) and many of the primary cen- tres for narcotics demand are also considered to be the demand end of the illicit antiquities market (e.g., the United States, Europe). The susceptibility of the market in illicit cultural objects to money laundering has been established (Bowman 2008; Brodie 1999, 2009; De Sanctis 2013; Christ and von Selle 2012; Mackenzie 2011; Ulph 2011). Of those organized trafficking groups involved in a diversified portfolio of illicit activities, most are dealing in drugs as well as other commodities (Mackenzie 2002: 2). The market prices obtained for antiq- uities seem too high for such organizations to ignore. It “makes sense” that organized criminal groups involved in drug trafficking would also engage in antiquities trafficking when it was convenient. Yet, for the most part, assertions that these two illicit markets are connected during sourcing, transit, or sale remain speculative at best.

In this chapter I will present a preliminary evaluation of existing evidence for the connection between antiquities trafficking and narcotics trafficking in Central America, particularly through the Petén department of the Republic of Guatemala, the heartland of the ancient Maya. I will begin with an overview of what is known about the historic structure of Central American antiquities looting and trafficking networks. Two phases of semi-organized and organized looting in the region are identified, the shift occurring due to changes in regu- lation and enforcement. This is followed by a discussion of the rise of narcotics trafficking in the region as it relates to post-conflict land distribution: a situ- ation that brings both narcotics traffickers and the victims of their support economies closer and closer to archaeological sites. I will then present two preliminary case studies of archaeological sites exploited, at least in part, as a result of the activities of narcotics cartels. I will conclude with a short assess- ment of what evidence exists for antiquities being looted and moved by nar- cotics traffickers and what realistic connections appear to exist between these two illicit networks.",TRUE,FALSE,antiquities|drugs|Guatemala|heritage|heritage studies|illicit antiquities|Latin America|Maya|narcotics|preservation|trafficking,2018-07-02T10:58:13.151016,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T11:46:03.560501,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ce9|Arts and Humanities|Latin American Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cee|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Art and Architecture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/citation/,xe7p9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/twk52/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/relationships/node/,twk52,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c08f96c613b0266c413e8/,592c08f96c613b0266c413e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xe7p9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xe7p9

During this transformation, Maya archaeology was largely colonized, in a sense, by the American academic empire. Excavation was undertaken to further a structured concept of science and to solidify the idea of archaeology as an institutionalized discipline. The results of archaeological fieldwork on remote sites were not easily independently verified due to the constraints of the forbidding landscape and the vastness of this largely untapped resource. The known character of a particular scholar was considered to be a sufficient recommendation as to the quality of his textual archaeological record. This dependence on text resulted in a number of factual mistakes that have been repeated in publications and museum displays up to the present day. During this period in the development of the discipline, I assert that archaeological publication, not site stabilisation, was regarded as a sufficient means by which a remote site could be effectively ‘preserved’.

As a case study I will discuss early 20th century excavations within an early Classic Maya mortuary structure at the site of Holmul, Guatemala. In this extreme case, a report supposedly started by Raymond Edwin Merwin, the only archaeologist who had worked at this remote Maya city, was ‘completed’ after his untimely death by another scholar, George C. Vaillant, who had never visited the site. Due to the perceived notability of Merwin’s role in driving Maya archaeology into the realm of systematic science, Vaillant felt that the information he published was reliable and, indeed, required as the location of Holmul would effectively prevent archaeological work from being conducted there for nearly a century.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Central America|Guatemala|history of archaeology|history of science|Maya|Mesoamerica|practice|preservation|publication,2018-07-02T10:58:13.073401,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T11:40:55.916038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ce9|Arts and Humanities|Latin American Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cee|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Art and Architecture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/citation/,xyt36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bvwu9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/relationships/node/,bvwu9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c085db83f69027195df47/,592c085db83f69027195df47,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xyt36/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xyt36

By combining an analysis of recent legal changes related to the creation of the autonomies and a short discussion of a notable case study of local management of a Bolivian archaeological site, this article offers a basic summary of the legal framework in which Bolivian archaeology and heritage management functions and some preliminary recommendations for governments and professionals wishing to work with Bolivian authorities at the state and local level.",TRUE,FALSE,Andes|antiquities|archeology|Bolivia|heritage|heritage studies|illicit antiquities|Latin America|policy|preservation,2018-07-02T10:58:12.991904,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T11:38:19.558816,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c23|Law|Indian and Aboriginal Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c57|Law|Other Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5e|Law|Law and Race|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ce9|Arts and Humanities|Latin American Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cee|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Art and Architecture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dde|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy History, Theory, and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/citation/,gne2k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m4jac/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/relationships/node/,m4jac,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c077f9ad5a100472683d6/,592c077f9ad5a100472683d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gne2k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gne2k/,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0940739111000257,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gne2k

To discuss the key aspects of the international trade in antiquities and the practice of philanthropic donation of object to museums that allow for certain types of tax deduction manipulation using a case of tax deduction manipulation from Australia and a case of tax fraud from the United States as examples.

Design/methodology/approach
Two thoroughly researched case studies are presented which illustrate the particular features of current and past antiquities donation incentivization schemes which leave them open to manipulation and fraud.

Findings
The valuation of antiquities is subjective and problematic and the operations of both the antiquities market and the museums sector are traditionally opaque. Because of this tax incentivisation of antiquities donations, is susceptible to fraud.

Originality/value
This paper presents the mechanisms of the antiquities market and museum world to an audience that is not familiar with it. It then clearly demonstrates how the traditional practices of this world can be manipulated for the purposes of tax fraud. Two useful case studies are presented and one of these case studies has never been academically published before, despite it being the cause for a change in Australian tax law.",TRUE,FALSE,acquisitions|antiquities|appraisal|cultural heritage|cultural property|donations|fraud|heritage|illicit antiquities|museums|tax deductions,2018-07-02T10:58:12.735738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T10:58:21.200707,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/citation/,73uat,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ey8fj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/relationships/node/,ey8fj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592bfdf4b83f69027195dced/,592bfdf4b83f69027195dced,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73uat/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/73uat/,https://doi.org/10.1108/JFC-11-2014-0051,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/73uat
