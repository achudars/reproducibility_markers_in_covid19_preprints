Few analyses have focused on the spatial segregation of sexual minorities from the majority. In this paper we analyze the residential segregation of gay male and lesbian households from heterosexual married and heterosexual cohabiting households. We use two dissimilarity measures of residential segregation and draw on data from the American Community Surveys for 2008 through 2012 to calculate segregation scores for the 100 MSAs with the largest gay male and lesbian populations in around the year 2010. We show that there is a sizable amount of homosexual-heterosexual residential segregation.

Yet this excitement was coupled with some hesitation. I felt the need to disguise my excitement among my queer friends. I presented the gay rodeo’s allure as rooted in simple curiosity, a chance to further my academic study of queer life. However, I was personally interested in finding others like me - other queers who appreciated country as a lifestyle or one might even say as an ethnicity - rather than simply as a place. Country meant good things to me; I dreamt of owning land and livestock and I loved country music and dancing.   One of the most difficult aspects of coming out for me was how drastically the setting for my social life changed as I moved away from the country spaces and country activities that I had previously known and enjoyed.My previous “straight” life involved what one could call “country” entertainment. It took place in dusty arenas, around animals and in bars that played country music. Upon coming out, my social life moved to house parties or venues that played dance and pop music and I rarely took road trips to small towns for markets, fairs, or rodeos. Rather, I was more likely to make trips to a big city for nightlife, shopping, and art. While I know this sounds like a simplistic juxtaposition of bad stereotypes, it really felt that way tome at the time. The sociologist inme often reflected on why this occurred. I now suspect one influential factor was the lack of mainstream knowledge regarding the true diversity of queer life at the time, which was almost two decades ago.  On the level of appearances, it seemed simple. Queer people were unwelcome in country places - places associated with rednecks, Republicans, and ignorance. Thus, we did not go there.After all, the mass media had taught us that country was a place where we would die not only from isolation, but also from even more horrible cruel, painful, violent, and undignified deaths like Brandon Teena or being crucified on a fence like Matthew Shepard. Yet, at times I was uncomfortable in ostensibly safe, queer spaces due to tomy country background. Ironically, it often felt like my rural conservative friends and acquaintances were less disapproving of my sexual orientation than my liberal queer friends were of my country tastes.So one can understand why I was so excited to hear about a gay rodeo. I anticipated a queer country wonderland extravaganza that encompassed all of the “good” that country culture had to offer and none of the bad. I did not have to worry about coming out or being too gay and cowboy hats were not associated with fears of homophobic harassment.",TRUE,FALSE,LGBT|Rodeo,2018-07-02T11:33:29.476253,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-03T01:00:22.248202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/citation/,gf27k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s5w43/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/relationships/node/,s5w43,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4bd2fb346836000d9387a7/,5a4bd2fb346836000d9387a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf27k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gf27k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gf27k,NA

Using a social constructionist definition of sexuality, we both enumerate those who identify, desire, and behave as bisexual as well as compare some basic demographic characteristics of bisexuality with heterosexuality, homosexuality, and asexuality. Overall, we find that conclusions about the prevalence of bisexuality and the characteristics of bisexual individuals versus other sexualities do differ depending on the dimension employed.

Contentious debates on family values and same-sex marriage, increasing rates of social tolerance for homosexuality, and a greater general academic attention on issues of sexual orientation have partially spurred this attention in demographic analysis of lesbian and gay families. It is becoming increasingly clear that sexual orientation and gender identity have an effect on demographic processes and life outcomes. Although not perfect, practically speaking, drawing on nationally representative survey data has allowed us to illuminate the presence of same-sex families and their children.These findings have an iterative relationship with social change, public policy, and increasing tolerance for diversity.

Sources of influence can be divided as external, which are independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the extent of contagion based on large-scale observational data with an unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human dynamics and the detailed approach of social sciences, we present a parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in political science--elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical expression of the county vote-share distribution, which is in excellent agreement with almost a century of observed U.S. presidential election data.

rapid growth of new startups offering smartphone-enabled dispatch service for taxicabs, limousines,
and ridesharing vehicles. This change in communicative technology has been accompanied by the
creation of new categories of car service, particularly as drivers of limousines and private vehicles use
the apps to provide on-demand service of a kind previously reserved for taxicabs. One of the most
controversial new models of car service is for-profit ridesharing, which combines the for-profit model
of taxi service with the overall traffic reduction goals of ridesharing. A preliminary attempt is here
made at understanding how for-profit ridesharing compares to traditional taxicab and ridesharing
models. Ethnographic interviews are drawn on to illustrate the range of motivations and strategies used
by for-profit ridesharing drivers in San Francisco, California as they make use of the service. A range
of driver strategies is identified, ranging from incidental, to part-time, to full-time driving. This makes
possible a provisional account of the potential ecological impacts of the spread of this model of car
service, based on the concept of taxicab efficiency, conceived as the ratio of shared vs. unshared miles

A Wikipédia é citada em revistas científicas de alto impacto, apesar de sua má reputação como fonte de informação. O que sustenta essa aceitação? Em busca de respostas, este artigo apresenta uma avaliação da Wikipédia anglófona segundo o roteiro de Silberger para obras de referência quanto ao propósito, alcance, arranjo, informação dada, acesso e características especiais, com um aspecto adicional: o controle da qualidade do conteúdo. Complementa essa avaliação um relato da experiência do autor na criação de um verbete em português. Em conclusão, a Wikipédia tem conteúdo de alta qualidade, com vantagens como o grande volume de conteúdo em muitas línguas, bem como desvantagens, como a ênfase em tópicos “populares”. Há também conteúdo inadequado, cuja contenção e reparo dependem da capacidade e engajamento da comunidade linguística que a edita, bem como do respeito a seus princípios editoriais. Há oportunidade para engajar estudantes do ensino superior na criação de conteúdos, bem como na avaliação, que é uma forma de “revisão por pares”. O bom uso da Wikipédia depende essencialmente da capacidade crítica do leitor.

Abstract
Wikipedia is cited in high-profile scientific journals, despite its poor reputation as information source. What warrants this acceptance by scientists? In search for answers, this article presents an assessment of the English Wikipedia according to Silberger's guide for reference works, analyzing its purpose, scope, arrangement, information given, access, and special characteristics, with an additional aspect: quality control of new content. An account of the author's experience in creating an entry in the Portuguese Wikipedia complements the assessment. In conclusion, Wikipedia has high quality content, with advantages such as the large volume of content in many languages, as well as disadvantages such as the emphasis on “popular” topics. There is also inadequate content, whose containment and repair depend on the literacy and engagement of the linguistic community that publishes it, as well as on following Wikipedia's editorial principles. Content creation is an opportunity to engage higher education students, as well as content evaluation, which is a form of peer review. Fruitful use of Wikipedia content depends essentially on the reader's critical judgment.
