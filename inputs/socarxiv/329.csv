The 250 years-old discussion on technological unemployment reawakens. Frey and Osborne (2012) estimate that half of US employment will be automated by algorithms within the next 20 years.

The main contribution of our work is to show that the diversity of previous findings regarding the degree of job automation is, to a large extent, driven by model selection and not by controlling for personal characteristics or tasks. For our case study, we consult Austrian experts in machine learning and industry professionals on the susceptibility to digital technologies in the Austrian labour market.

Using a sample of public crimes and case clearances in Dallas, Texas, we examine the efficacy that public CCTV cameras increase case clearance rates using a pre-post research design. We find that cases closer to cameras did have an increased clearance rate after the cameras were installed in Dallas. But the effects faded quite quickly in space, and were mostly limited to thefts.

A Quasi-Experimental Approach.,"On February 2, 2017, French police officers brutally abused a young black man, leading to the first wave of 2017 French riots. The present study exploits the coincidence that the focal event occurred during the survey period of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2016 (Nov. 11, 2016 – March 11, 2017) in France, thus providing the basis for a Natural Experiment on the effect of media reporting on police misconduct on trust in the police. Data is analyzed by means of a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) as well as more conventional regression analyses with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. In line with procedural justice theory as well as institutional theory, the present study finds support for the notion that this special case of police misconduct did decrease trust in the police. In addition, people reporting a migrant background show even less trust in the police after the event. Frequency of different media consumption does not appear to explain deterioration of trust in the police after the event. The results of this study increase the internal and external validity of the assumption that trust in the police can be explained not only by personal experiences, but also by the perceived unfair treatment of others. Results are robust to various placebo tests. There is some evidence that the effect seems to be short-lived, although the data basis is limited in this regard. Several fruitful approaches for future studies are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-15T15:10:24.051995,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-15T15:09:51.874588,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology",Christof Nägel|Mark Lutter,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/citation/,9ad37,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tvbh4/,tvbh4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d555afcb71697001611c957/,5d555afcb71697001611c957,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ad37/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ad37/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ad37,NA

Nevertheless, how to shift population behaviour patterns in this way remains one of the greatest uncertainties for research and policy. Evidence about behaviour change interventions that are easier to evaluate tends to overshadow that for population- and system-wide approaches that generate and sustain healthier behaviours. Population health interventions are often implemented as natural experiments, which makes their evaluation more complex and unpredictable than a typical randomised controlled trial (RCT). We discuss the growing importance of evaluating natural experiments, and their distinctive contribution to the evidence for public health policy. We contrast the established evidence-based practice pathway, in which RCTs generate ‘definitive’ evidence for particular interventions, with a practice-based evidence pathway in which evaluation can help adjust the compass bearing of existing policy. We propose that intervention studies should focus on reducing critical uncertainties, that non-randomised study designs should be embraced rather than tolerated, and that a more nuanced approach to appraising the utility of diverse types of evidence is required. The complex evidence needed to guide public health action is not necessarily the same as that which is needed to provide an unbiased effect size estimate. The practice-based evidence pathway is neither inferior, nor merely the best available when all else fails. It is often the only way to generate meaningful evidence to address critical questions about investing in population health interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,Evaluation; natural experimental studies; non-randomised studies; practice-based evidence; public health policy,2019-08-15T15:08:43.445231,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-15T15:07:55.756771,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/citation/,s36km,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d553dfbb7169700191121d3/,5d553dfbb7169700191121d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s36km/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s36km,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2019-213085

Although this macro-level trend is well-established in research literature, less is known about subnational patterns of income inequality in the U.S., particularly as they vary between and within rural and urban localities. Using Census and ACS data, this study produces Gini estimates of within-county income inequality and examines these trends across a six-strata urban-rural typology from 1970 to 2016. This study finds the following. Income inequality has remained consistently higher in nonmetropolitan counties than metropolitan counties throughout the study period. However, levels of inequality have converged by 2016, a convergence that has been driven by increases in metropolitan counties. There are notable exceptions to the secular trend of increasing inequality. The central Plains region has experienced decreasing levels of inequality, and inequality in large, peripheral metropolitan counties lags noticeably behind other types of counties. Almost all low-inequality counties in 1970 have shifted to moderate- or high-inequality, such that almost no one lives in low-inequality places by 2016. This increase in exposure to inequality has been particularly dramatic among residents of large, central metropolitan counties. As the only county-level analysis to track income inequality across the rural-urban continuum from 1970 to 2016, this study lays the foundation for more sophisticated analyses that explain spatial variation in income inequality and that account for the demographic and economic diversity of the rural and urban United States.",TRUE,FALSE,income inequality|rural demography|rural-urban continuum|spatial inequality|United States,2019-08-14T19:42:25.646836,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14T19:42:06.953409,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Brian C.

Modeling such networks within the exponential-family random graph (ERG) framework has been previously limited to special cases and, in particular, to dependence arising from just two layers.  Extensions to ERGMs are introduced to address these limitations: Conway--Maxwell-Binomial distribution to model the marginal dependence among multiple layers; a ""layer logic"" language to translate familiar ERGM effects to substantively meaningful interactions of observed layers; and non-degenerate triadic and degree effects.  The developments are demonstrated on two previously published data sets.",TRUE,FALSE,conway-maxwell-binomial|ergm|exponential family|multi-layer|multiplexity|multi-relational|social networks,2019-08-14T19:41:22.601871,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14T19:41:04.569776,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/citation/,dqe9b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d545253c3f52f001bff73fd/,5d545253c3f52f001bff73fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqe9b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dqe9b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dqe9b,NA

To address this issue, a plethora of demand reduction efforts have been carried out. These necessitate consumer research which provides crucial knowledge for designing and evaluating targeted interventions. We implemented a rigorous consumer survey on saiga (Saiga tatarica) horn use in Singapore, where usage is legal and widely sold. Saiga are Critically Endangered antelopes from Central Asia with horns (often marketed as ling yang) used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Few past studies have assessed saiga horn consumers. This work is the most extensive consumer research to date specifically characterising saiga horn consumers and usage. We conducted 2294 in-person surveys on saiga horn use with Chinese Singaporeans, employing neutral questioning approaches. We found 19% of individuals reported saiga horn as a product they choose most often for themselves and/or others when treating fever and/or heatiness (a TCM state of illness), indicating a minimum estimate of high-frequency usage, not including possible low-frequency users. Overall saiga users were most characterised as middle-aged Buddhists and Taoists. However, saiga users were found in a range of demographic groups. Women preferred saiga shavings (the more traditional form), while men preferred saiga cooling water (the more modern form). About 53% of individuals who used saiga horn themselves also bought it for someone else. Buyers for others were most likely to be female middle-aged Buddhists or Taoists. Key motivating reasons for usage were “it works” and “someone recommended it to me.” The top two reported recommenders were family and TCM shopkeepers. Saiga users were more likely than non-saiga users to perceive saiga as a common species in the wild. This research holds significance for interventions targeting saiga horn consumption within Singapore and throughout Asia, by identifying potential target audiences, product types, non-desirable alternatives, and motivations for use.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-14T18:55:31.744183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14T18:55:00.733199,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/citation/,t4dp7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bk879/,bk879,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d54374e278c07001aad7f00/,5d54374e278c07001aad7f00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t4dp7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t4dp7,NA

Addressing this gap, we present results from a q-methodological study on the meanings and values associated with translation held by researchers and clinicians at two major German biomedical research institutions implementing TR strategies. We identify eight different collective understandings of translation in practice, with respect to both where primary translational problems are located and what the most immediate and effective measures should be. Our findings suggest that there may not be a one-fits-all solution for improving translation and that general regulatory and organizational measures may be less effective than measures addressing specific audiences and their specific viewpoints.",TRUE,FALSE,bench to bedside|biomedical translation|clinician scientists|practice|Q methodology|translation|translational research,2019-08-14T18:54:25.882908,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14T18:54:05.562421,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/citation/,srcma,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d53f987f55aa10018b827b8/,5d53f987f55aa10018b827b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcma/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/srcma/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/srcma,NA
