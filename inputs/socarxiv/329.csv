Whether such trends hold across the multi-ethnic society of Russia is not known.
Objective: We describe levels and trends in ethnic intermarriage rates in four highly different regions of Russia.
Methods: We analyse census data from Moscow, Kazan, Makhachkala, Vladikavkaz, calculate odds ratios for ethnic intermarriage and fit log-linear and log-multiplicative models to test for trends in intermarriage. We use age as a proxy for marriage/cohabitation cohorts. 
Results: We find no change in ethnic intermarriage in Moscow, but more intermarriage in younger cohorts in the other three cities.  However, in Kazan and Vladikavkaz the trend is towards more intermarriage between Russians and Tatars, and between Russians and Ossetians, respectively, while in Makhachkala, where there are few ethnic Russians, the trend is towards more intermarriage between indigenous Muslim peoples. 
Conclusions: Levels and trends in ethnic intermarriage vary substantially throughout Russia by locality and ethnic group. There is no evidence for a trend towards increased intermarriage in Moscow. 
Contribution: We provide new insight into ethnic intermarriage in Russia.

A panel data analysis of causal mechanisms,"Many studies document the positive association between accessed social capital and wages. It is widely accepted that the underlying relationship is causal. However, most studies use cross-sectional data, and only a few test causal mechanisms. In our analysis, we first test a broad range of social capital indicators by applying fixed-effects panel data regression to a sample of currently employed and a sample of newly employed individuals. Second, we test reservation wages, network search, being offered a job without prior job search, and the number of job interviews as some of the theoretical mechanisms put forward to explain positive social capital effects.

Drawing on insights from psychology, we argue that non-judgmentally exchanging narratives in interpersonal conversations can facilitate durable reductions in exclusionary attitudes. We support this argument with evidence from three pre-registered field experiments targeting exclusionary attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants and transgender people. In these experiments, 230 canvassers conversed with 6,869 voters across 7 US locations. In Experiment 1, face-to-face conversations deploying arguments alone had no effects on voters’ exclusionary immigration policy or prejudicial attitudes, but otherwise identical conversations also including the non-judgmental exchange of narratives durably reduced exclusionary attitudes for at least four months (d = 0.08). Experiments 2 and 3, targeting transphobia, replicate these findings and support the scalability of this strategy (ds = 0.08, 0.04).

Television tastes and cultural distinction among college students in Beijing,"Can television taste function as cultural capital in contemporary China? This paper investigates, for the first time, how Chinese engage with global pop culture to mark their positions in China’s swiftly changing social and cultural hierarchies. Using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) of a survey (n=422) and 48 interviews with students at an elite Beijing university, we identify three distinct taste dimensions: not-knowers versus dislikers; TV lovers versus avoiders; and Western and Eastern TV taste. We identify dimensions 1 and 3 as cultural capital dimensions: respondents on the “high end” draw taste-based social boundaries vis-à-vis those on the low end, who in turn accept the hierarchies implied in these tastes. The two dimensions differ in the criteria used to make aesthetic distinctions, the type of cultural knowledge they rely on, and in the strength of their boundary-drawing. We conclude that the “Western” taste is more exclusive than the “dislike” taste. The first is mainly based on aesthetic criteria (complexity, authenticity), whereas the second combines aesthetic (complexity, depth) and cosmopolitan (language skills, international experience) distinctions. While the liking of both dimensions is related to parental cultural capital (education, occupation, urbanity), the “Western” taste also correlates with parental economic capital and international experience. This “discovery” of cultural capital in China has implications for our understanding of cultural and cosmopolitan capital, of the global diffusion of cultural goods and the aesthetic and status systems implied in these goods, and for our understanding of culture and stratification in China.",TRUE,FALSE,aesthetics|boundary-drawing|China|cosmopolitan capital|cultural capital|cultural diffusion|distinction|globalization|taste|television,2020-02-05T17:19:42.034135,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-05T17:19:14.494157,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/citation/,mgkdp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3a8930032a4d0049e6ee3b/,5e3a8930032a4d0049e6ee3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgkdp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mgkdp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mgkdp,NA

Early child development predicts a range of later outcomes including educational achievement, employment, involvement in crime, health, and social care need. Inequalities in early childhood also cause inequalities in health later on in life. Because of this, early childhood is an important time for intervention. School readiness in England is used to refer to an assessment of a child's cognitive, emotional, and physical development, and is a major focus of effort for local and national policymakers. However, evidence on what factors affect school readiness is needed to guide policymakers at local and national levels. 
Methods
I analysed a panel data set of 150 English upper tier local authorities from 2012 to 2016, for a total of 750 local-authority years. I used fixed effects poisson regression models to test for associations between local trends in school readiness performance and sure start spending, non-sure start children’s services spending, and child poverty rates.
Results
After adjustment for local trends in child poverty and spending on other children’s services, local trends in Sure Start spending were positively associated with school readiness, both among all children and among children eligible for free school meals (an indicator of poverty). All effects were small, with a 10% change in per-child Sure Start spending associated with a less than 0.2% change in school readiness performance.
Conclusion
Despite limitations associated with the ecological nature of this study, it provides evidence that Sure Start spending may improve school readiness. This complements wider evidence on the health benefits of Sure Start, suggesting that this programme had benefits across a range of outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-02-04T19:09:23.147061,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-04T19:09:12.951008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/citation/,rbcz5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e396badfa39b701e11dbc59/,5e396badfa39b701e11dbc59,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rbcz5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rbcz5,NA

Changing disparities of household non-employment in Europe during the Great Recession,"This comparative study analyses the impact of the Great Recession on household non-employment across Europe since 2008. We use the EU-SILC (2007 to 2014) for a shift-share analysis that de-composes annual variations in household non-employment in 30 European countries. Investigating whether job-loss is absorbed or accumulated by households, we break down non-employment vari-ations to changes in individual non-employment, household compositions, and polarization. We find that jobless households increased since 2008, especially in crisis countries. There is no evi-dence for widespread absorption of individual non-employment in families or multi-person house-holds. Instead, household dynamics and unequal distribution of non-employment leads to further risk accumulation within households during the crisis. Paradoxically, this pattern occurs in those crisis countries known for their traditional household structures and less accommodating welfare systems which have relied thus far on families to absorb employment risks. The impact of the crisis has aggravated household disparities in joblessness.",TRUE,FALSE,comparative study|decomposition|economic crisis|employment|Europe|household,2020-02-04T19:07:24.725443,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-04T19:07:03.873788,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/citation/,pr57z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/huxbj/,huxbj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e39540657427b01f80c36c3/,5e39540657427b01f80c36c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr57z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pr57z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pr57z,https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaa003
