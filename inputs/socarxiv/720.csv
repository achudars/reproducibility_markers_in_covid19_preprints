Convex hulls are widely used in computer science, and have been applied in fields such as ecology, but are heretofore underutilized in population studies.  We briefly discuss convex hulls, then we show how they may profitably be applied to demography.  We do this through three examples, drawn from the relationship between child mortality and adult survivorship (5q0 and 45p15 in life table notation).  The three examples are: (i) sex differences in mortality; (ii) period and cohort differences and (iii) outlier identification.  Convex hulls can be useful in robust compilation of demographic databases. Moreover, the gap/lag framework for sex differences or period/cohort differences is more complex when mortality data are arrayed by two components as opposed to a unidimensional measure such as life expectancy.  Our examples show how, in certain cases, convex hulls can identify patterns in demographic data more readily than other techniques.

Chaos describes certain nonlinear dynamical systems that have a very sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are always deterministic and may be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent behavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically, and scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to discover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed, few fields have drawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from strange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams and embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these types of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This article has three aims. First, it argues for several visualization methods to critically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. Second, it uses these visualizations to introduce the foundations of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity and the limits of prediction.

While Honolulu has supportive density and topography for rail transit, questions remain about its ability to effectively integrate urban design and accessibility across the system. Every transit trip begins and ends with a walking trip from origins and to destinations: transportation planning must account for pedestrian safety, comfort, and access. Ildefons Cerdà’s 19th century utopian plan for Barcelona’s Eixample district produced a renowned, livable urban form. The Eixample, with its well-integrated rail transit, serves as a model of urban design, land use, transportation planning, and pedestrian-scaled streets working in synergy to produce accessibility. This study discusses the urban form of Honolulu and the history and planning of its new rail transit system. Then it reviews the history of Cerdà’s plan for the Eixample and discusses its urban form and performance today. Finally it draws several lessons from Barcelona’s urban design, accessibility, and rail transit planning and critically discusses their applicability to policy and design in Honolulu.

To address this gap, we collected, cleaned, analyzed, mapped, and visualized 11 million Craigslist rental housing listings. The data reveal fine-grained spatial and temporal patterns within and across metropolitan housing markets in the U.S. We find some metropolitan areas have only single-digit percentages of listings below fair market rent. Nontraditional sources of volunteered geographic information offer planners real-time, local-scale estimates of rent and housing characteristics currently lacking in alternative sources, such as census data.",TRUE,FALSE,affordable housing|big data|craigslist|data science|GIS|housing|housing markets|housing policy|python|urban economics|urban geography|urban planning|VGI|web scraping,2018-07-02T10:53:44.425236,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-24T16:48:26.768000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/citation/,v54w4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hr652/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/relationships/node/,hr652,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d54d2c594d90004aaf3061/,58d54d2c594d90004aaf3061,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v54w4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v54w4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v54w4,https://doi.org/10.1177/0739456X16664789

Should it matter? The answer is yes, but decades of planning policy and practice seem to suggest otherwise. There are many proven benefits of healthy, accessible, affordable and sustainable food. Proper nourishment has been linked to better classroom performance. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention argue that walkable access to healthy food can reduce America’s growing obesity and diabetes epidemics. Locally-sourced food reinforces better dietary habits as consumers connect with the value chain and perceive eating as a more natural process.",TRUE,FALSE,community development|food|food policy|food systems|modernism|neighborhood|public health|sustainability|urban design|urban planning,2018-07-02T10:47:34.946441,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-24T16:44:14.710000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/citation/,a5e2q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jk96r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/relationships/node/,jk96r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d54c766c613b0049a06468/,58d54c766c613b0049a06468,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5e2q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a5e2q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a5e2q,NA

LEED-ND was developed as a system for rating new neighborhoods on the sustainability of their planning.  However, it has increasingly been adopted by cities as a de facto measure of “livable” neighborhood design and used to accelerate development processes.  We hypothesize that these criteria do not accurately capture livability as defined by residents. Our study area is Temescal, a gentrifying neighborhood in Oakland, CA.  Temescal could not achieve LEED-ND certification due to technical disqualifications yet residents of the neighborhood rated its livability very highly.  Furthermore, residents consistently rated and ranked NPD characteristics quite differently than did LEED-ND, calling into question its validity as a universally codifiable rating system.  We propose that a single set of weighted, prescriptive design guidelines may not be able to reflect the diverse values and desired amenities of different communities.",TRUE,FALSE,architecture|california|development|LEED|LEED-ND|livability|neighborhood|oakland|sustainability|urban design|urbanization|urban planning,2018-07-02T10:51:06.132387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-24T16:41:23.854000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/citation/,jpjhq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uvgcx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/relationships/node/,uvgcx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d54b966c613b0045a06533/,58d54b966c613b0045a06533,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpjhq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jpjhq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jpjhq,NA
