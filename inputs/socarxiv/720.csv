When the FCC proposed allowing low-power devices to use UHF ""white
spaces"" on a license exempt basis, they were unsure whether spectrum
monitoring or geo-database lookup would be the best way to manage the
devices' frequency selection. Since these methods were discussed as
alternatives, few people noticed that they have very different
political implications. Effective sensing of the local radio spectrum
can lead to autonomous, self-managing devices. These reduce the need
for strict government controls over spectrum access, making such
devices a force for liberalization. On the other hand, a radio which
simply follows instructions given by a database, and which must
regularly renew its permission to operate, is a slave, and it is
described that way in white space standards and regulatory documents.
Far from being a force for liberalization, database slaves represent a
drastic extension of regulatory control into the radio domain which
has been the freest (license exemption).

White space devices are expected to reduce the cost and increase the
availability of broadband access in rural areas. But if these devices
depend on geo-database lookup, the temporary but total cutoffs of
Internet access in Egypt, Libya and Syria should make one wonder if it
is wise to give government-sanctioned control centers a “kill switch”
for public broadband access. Geo-database management can yield many
benefits. But it entails a degree of political risk which could be
dangerous in some contexts. It can also delay or even block the
development of the truly autonomous ""smart"" radios needed for
minimalist regulation.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:31.822165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-19T12:14:57.338000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/citation/,94gkw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2weqf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/relationships/node/,2weqf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578e19c2594d9001f281655e/,578e19c2594d9001f281655e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/94gkw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/94gkw

This is a background paper for an ITU Workshop on ""Market Mechanisms
for Spectrum Management"" (Geneva, Switzerland, 22-23 January 2007). It
summarizes the Open Spectrum Foundation's global survey of Wi-Fi
regulations, with ""thumbnail sketches"" of the rules in over 170
countries. It proposes a new ITU Study Question on how to reconcile
the growing recognition of licence-free radio bands as a ""best
practice"" in spectrum management with the long-standing rule (now
found in S18.1 of the International Radio Regulations) that all
nongovernment radio transmitters must be licenced. Finally, it
discusses the implications of regulators having the ability to create
new authorisation classes in the gap between licenced and unlicenced.
That shifts the debate between proponents of (unlicenced) ""open
spectrum"" - and the proponents of (licenced) spectrum as tradable
property - onto unstable, unfamiliar ground. It could lead to
""multi-dimensional bidding"" in spectrum auctions - as is found
sometimes in government procurement tenders where bidders can combine
price offers and quality/performance commitments. It may also lead to
an understanding of spectrum access rights as a continuum which can be

sovereignty over the electromagnetic spectrum. These assertions were
initially embraced as a way to control the monopolistic ambitions and
offensive business practices of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph
Company. They are still the basis of radio regulation. However, as
wireless communication moves to higher and higher frequencies - into
the range of infrared (heat) and free space optics (light) - it is
becoming obvious that claiming sovereignty over radio frequencies

Published in EastBound, Vol. 1, March 13, 2006

For nearly a century, governments have imposed detailed limits on the
use of radio - who can use what frequencies and waveforms, at what
power levels, in which locations, for what purposes. Licenses
summarize these controls for specific users or stations. State control
of radio use goes far beyond what is accepted for other media,
(publishing, photography, Internet, speech, etc.). Most people think
this is necessary to control interference; others felt that
broadcasting was too powerful a social influence to be left
unregulated.

But recently, there has been explosive growth in short-range, personal
uses of radio - Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cordless phones, etc. The arguments
used to justify radio licensing seem inappropriate for such low-power
devices. In fact, government regulation of purely personal, informal
communications is unnecessarily intrusive and politically risky. Many
countries now allow some short-range wireless devices to be used
without a license in specific bands. In general, smarter radios go a
long way toward solving problems that once seemed to require rigid
government controls, giving rise to the open spectrum movement.

At the same time, digitalisation and the widening use of TCP/IP make
it possible to transmit nearly any content through any channel. We use
our mobile phones to take photographs, send text messages and watch
videoclips. Our cable television networks provide Internet access.
Seeping out of their original contexts, dissimilar media traditions
now mix and clash in interconnecting, hybrid networks. In this
situation, it is crucially important to the future of human
communication which regulatory norms emerge as default choices and
dominant models. Will it be broadcasting, telephony, publishing,
Internet or ordinary speech that sets the tone for communications
policy in the age of ubiquitous networks? Which regulatory approach do
we WANT to set the tone?",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:48.718997,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-19T11:52:20.797000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/citation/,wn23a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7jbsj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/relationships/node/,7jbsj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578e1476594d9001f38164db/,578e1476594d9001f38164db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn23a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wn23a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wn23a

Secularism, even in small amounts, is associated with population stagnation or even decline, whereas highly religious countries have higher fertility rates that promote population growth. This country-level pattern is driven by more than aggregate lower fertility of secular individuals. In fact, societal secularism is a better predictor of highly religious individuals’ fertility behavior than that of secular individuals, and this pattern is largely a function of cultural values related to gender, reproduction, and autonomy in secular societies.

On-line multiplayer role-playing games have become an important social and business feature of the Internet.  The virtual worlds that game players inhabit now encompass population counts and economic activity greater than that of many nations in the physical world.   The  activity of players participating in an on-line game community is closely tied to paratexts that may include magazines, websites, and even devices that lie outside the formal boundaries of the game, but which are intimately bound up in the transmission of knowledge and culture surrounding the game.  In this paper, I examine the legal structures that foster or inhibit particular gaming paratexts.  Such laws are in some senses extrinsic to the ""magic circle"" of the game, but these external rules are deployed as constraints to enforce the internal logic of the game.  Typically this occurs in cases where violation of the game's internal parameters would affect the owner's external marketing or business control.  Commercial game developers may use copyright and related anti-circumvention laws to enforce preferred readings of the game, largely by dominating the paratexts associated with their product.  Examining the control of paratexts yields important insights into the logic of legal rubrics governing on-line gaming.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:37.072856,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-19T01:07:24.410000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/citation/,asn4e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cz2zy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/relationships/node/,cz2zy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578d7d4d6c613b01e815cf63/,578d7d4d6c613b01e815cf63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/asn4e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/asn4e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/asn4e

While these automated tools greatly facilitate the retrieval and analysis of data for academic research, they may pose ethical problems for Internet researchers. Specifically, automated software bots place some load on servers being accessed, possibly in contradiction to the expected use of such servers, and possibly in violation of the legal prerogatives of web site owners. Determining how and when to access such web sites, and whether to seek the consent of web site owners for retrieval of publicly accessible data presents an apparent conflict between general principles of information policy and the emerging legal precedent regarding trespass to computers. This conflict may be characterized as pitting utilitarian considerations against deontological considerations in a fashion reminiscent of previous debates over informed consent in on-line research. In this paper, we examine both utilitarian and deontological characterizations of the ethical obligations of researchers employing automated data retrieval bots, and argue that the contrasts between the two approaches do not necessarily result in conflict. Instead, we argue that the tension within the relevant practices indicates the need for a ""meta-choice"" between utilitarian and deontological considerations. We further suggest certain factors that may differentiate such a ""metaethical"" choice in the context of automated data retrieval from the ""meta-ethical"" choice presented in previously identified contexts of human subjects research or of web browser technology design. In the end, we argue that by analyzing the ethical issues in terms of the contrast between utilitarian and deontological ethics, it is possible to resolve some of the ethical dilemmas regarding automated data retrieval in fruitful and cogent ways.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:34.484143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-19T00:49:25.466000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/citation/,9x3nz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k3vgk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/relationships/node/,k3vgk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578d7916b83f6901fae268c6/,578d7916b83f6901fae268c6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x3nz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9x3nz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9x3nz
