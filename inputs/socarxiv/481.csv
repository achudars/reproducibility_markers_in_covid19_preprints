The present mixed-method study specifically aims to find answers to the following research questions: (a) How do General Foundation Programme (GFP) students assess the English Souk initiative? (b) What challenges, if any, do the English Souk participants face during the simulation of the activity? And (c) What impacts do they state the English Souk has on developing oral communicative skills in them? The results were obtained via questionnaires returned from 50 GFP English Souk participants as well as a focus group conducted with eight voluntary subjects which were mapped against the views of six GFP teachers. They revealed a high degree of common satisfaction amongst the student and faculty respondents with the aim and intended outcomes of the English Souk approach. They also uncovered how the innovative practice had a positive correlation with developing learners’ language skills, irrespective of the challenges they faced during the enactment of the activity.

It adds authenticity to the work, indicates that the student has read extensively, and upholds academic integrity of the written piece. However, according to the author’s experience of teaching undergraduate level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students, using academic sources and citing references effectively is one of the most daunting features of academic writing. Therefore, this study investigates the challenges faced by students in citing academic sources while composing research based reports and, by the same token, the reasons behind them. It also considers teachers’ observations about these challenges and the strategies that can be adopted to support students. A mixed method approach was used where data were collected through student questionnaires, student focus groups, interviews with faculty members, and students’ assignment reports. The participants included 97 undergraduate-level Engineering students enrolled in three sessions of an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course called Communication Skills. The paper reports on the details of the research-based assignment and the measures used by the author to support students in integrating sources in the report. It was observed that the students found integration of academic sources as the most problematic requirements and features of the assignment. The data revealed that these challenges are direct consequences of students’ linguistic backgrounds; lack of appropriate writing skills; difficulty in comprehending articles due to the technical jargon used; and high word count of the academic papers. In response to that, the author strongly recommends the incorporation of academic literacies in the curricula of specialist courses as well as prompt, closer collaboration between language instructors and subject specialists. Though this study was limited to the students of a specific course, it is hoped that the findings will help other EFL and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instructors apprehend the crux of the issue and devise effective strategies to overcome the above-mentioned challenge.",TRUE,FALSE,academic sources; academic writing; source integration; English language  Proficiency,2018-08-21T13:27:21.738346,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:27:08.916463,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/citation/,esxuf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/usmh6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/relationships/node/,usmh6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b58f42da7bb001b708681/,5b7b58f42da7bb001b708681,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esxuf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/esxuf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/esxuf

Here an attempt to apply the constructivist approach (Kirshner et al., 2006; Westwood, 2008) to teaching the subject of English Research Methods (ERM) is made by using a technique of multiple guest lecturer sessions by the department working in different areas of linguistics to familiarize the students with research interests of their tutors. This paper is an attempt to find out students' attitude to the sessions, their (sessions) benefits and drawbacks. Students’ feedback was collected at the end of each session to identify advantages/disadvantages and extent of helpfulness of the practice through a questionnaire. The data was analysed with the help of both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results of the survey demonstrated the importance of guest speaker presentations for project writing as well as their (guest speakers’) positive impact on students’ motivation.

However, engaging Arab EFL learners in ER might be a very difficult task especially when they lack motivation and enthusiasm. Therefore, the current study explores the effects of online ER tools such as M-reader on Arab EFL learners’ motivation to read extensively and autonomously. M-reader is a free online tool which helps educational institutions to manage extensive reading. It supports students to read and understand graded readers by taking online quizzes which are available in its database. The study was conducted on first year college students enrolled in the General Foundation Programme at a private college in Oman where M-reader was introduced for the first time. The study attempted to identify how M-reader motivates Arab EFL learners for extensive reading and how it motivates them to become autonomous learners. To gauge the efficacy of M-reader and to identify the extent to which it has been successful with the selected sample, reading records from M-reader, student participations through questionnaires, focus interviews with top readers, and samples of motivational strategies used by the researcher  were collected and analyzed.

I extend the theorizing on frames by arguing that frame variation can be a response to new agendas and goals of countermovements and opponents. Specifically, for opponents to rights activism, frame variation can be reaction to the assertion of rights for new protagonists, specifically their entry into new spaces. This study analyzes frame variation of the most deleterious child protectionist claims about stranger danger, assertions that the presence of racial, gender, and sexual others in public spaces will harm children. This paper is a content analysis of political flyers and messages developed by Religious Right campaigns at the state and municipal level between 1974 and 2013; these campaigns framed gay men and transgender woman as threats to children in classrooms and bathrooms. For both gay men and transgender women these claims were most common at the start of rights advocacy. I argue that challengers make the most overt, deleterious arguments about harm to children when new groups initially advocate for legal rights and access to new spaces; as marginalized groups become more familiar and less “strange”, challengers make more covert claims about these groups, as stranger danger claims have waning cultural and political resonance.",TRUE,FALSE,framing|gay men|gender|sexuality|social movements|strangers|trans|transgender,2018-08-20T23:55:45.444005,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-20T23:55:30.947565,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/citation/,tb2ks,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/78kud/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/relationships/node/,78kud,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b0e082da7bb0019705b33/,5b7b0e082da7bb0019705b33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tb2ks/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy077,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tb2ks

It is produced by three processes, none of which are meritocratic: (1) talent is unequally distributed by the rigged lottery of birth, (2) talent is defined in ways that favor some traits over others, and (3) the market for talent is manipulated to maximally extract advantages by those who have more of it. To see how, we require a sociological perspective on economic rent. I argue that talent is a major means through which people seek rent in modern-day capitalism. Talent today is what inherited land was to feudal societies; an unchallenged source of symbolic and economic rewards. Whereas God sanctified the aristocracy’s wealth, contemporary privilege is legitimated by meritocracy. Drawing on the work of Gary Becker, Pierre Bourdieu and Jerome Karabel, I show how rent-seeking in modern societies has come to rely principally on rent definition and creation.

This study examines how paternal depression and masculine norm adherence affect father involvement. Using new data from the Survey of Contemporary Fatherhood (n=2181) and OLS regression models we focus on the effect of depression on four measures of fathering behavior, with masculine norm adherence as a moderator. Results indicated that depression and masculinity had independent effects on father involvement. Further, masculinity moderated the effect of depression for warmth, engagement, and use of harsh parenting—but not positive control. These results have important implications for how we think about the impact of depression on parenting and the role of socialized response in understanding fathering outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,depression|fatherhood|fathering|fathers|masculinity|parenting,2018-08-20T23:50:21.163498,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-20T23:50:01.831373,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/citation/,u6vhk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kaph8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/relationships/node/,kaph8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b79937795f24f0017ef73df/,5b79937795f24f0017ef73df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u6vhk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u6vhk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u6vhk

They tend to belong more to the realm of myth, as Tristram Shandy well knew. At what point did it become necessary, in the sense of unavoidable, to use computation to study culture? Was it a certain polemic, new kinds of data (Google Books, Project Gutenberg), the rise of analytical techniques (natural language processing, machine learning), technologies such as the internet or social media, or simply that powerful social actor called ""critical mass""? It is hard to say with much certainty, although I suspect people will be battling over this for years to come. For many, of course, there is nothing necessary about this approach at all.
