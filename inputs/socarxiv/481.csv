This article analyzes how lucky and unlucky outcomes influence future organizational learning, decision-making and performance. Team statistics and outcomes are analyzed over 769 National Football League seasons for 32 franchises from 1990-2015. Four specific sources of luck are identified and measured: 1) divergence of win outcomes from actual team quality; 2) difficulty of opposition; 3) fumble recovery rates and 4) player injuries. Teams and players have little or no influence over these lucky factors, which nevertheless influence game outcomes, and by extension, the careers of players and coaches. Luck alters game outcomes and in turn significantly influences the retention or firing of coaches and players, which shapes their career incentives and decision-making. In addition to negatively affecting future performance via distorted learning, luck can also generate perverse incentives; in this case, encouraging risk aversion and scapegoating. Mistaking noise for signal – and conflating luck with skill – is conducive to poorer future decisions and outcomes. Paradoxically, luck can provide a means of skill-based advantage for savvy decision-makers, who learn more effectively from noisy feedback than others who are misled.",TRUE,FALSE,careers|decision-making|football|luck|randomness|sports|sports analytics,2019-02-20T13:38:44.210742,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T13:12:50.463340,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/citation/,csfpy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d24f182a3950019c88972/,5c6d24f182a3950019c88972,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/csfpy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/csfpy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/csfpy,NA

The paper is an attempt to explore the imports of Bangladesh which is one of the most significant factors responsible for unfavorable trade balance of the country. The aim of the study is to intend some initiatives for an attempt to ultimately reshaping the trade balance of Bangladesh with her foreign trade partners. The paper examines the existence of the gravity theory for the imports of Bangladesh with its eight major trading partner countries- India, China, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, USA and Malaysia. The data set consists of yearly data from 1985 to 2003 in a panel approach. The paper comes across with the findings that the gravity theory is consistent with the imports of Bangladesh. That is, the geographical distance of Bangladesh with its partner countries has significant impacts on its imports. But in near future this may change because of different factors such as profitability, easy trade procedures, product delivery time etc. that influence the imports decision more than does the geographical distance. This paper finds mixed relationship between the GDP and imports of Bangladesh. It also shows that the imports of Bangladesh influence the domestic production very little because Bangladesh mostly imports consumer goods rather than capital goods. Moreover, the population of Bangladesh has significant impacts on imports which in turn implies that Bangladesh is not capable of producing adequate consumer goods to meet the increased demand resulted from high population growth. It also shows that partner countries‟ GDP has significant positive impacts and partner countries‟ population has mixed impact on imports of Bangladesh. This paper concludes that it will be an alarming situation for trade balance of Bangladesh if the imports continue to increase in such a pattern that the rate increases five to eight times more in respect of population increases and at the same time the ratio of capital goods in proportion of total imports decreases.",TRUE,FALSE,Geographical Distance|Gravity Model|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|Imports|Panel study|Population,2019-02-20T19:30:03.068902,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T19:28:29.484910,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/citation/,etmzk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mn8yw/,mn8yw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d166f82a3950017c94948/,5c6d166f82a3950017c94948,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/etmzk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/etmzk,NA

Variants of this MC model are being implemented in more than 60 different countries of the world. It has become almost a universal antidote for poverty especially from 2006 when Professor Muhammad Yunus- the founder of the Grameen Bank (GB) and the bank itself shared the Nobel peace prize. Although the GB is the pioneer of MC program in Bangladesh, there are many other non-governmental organizations (NGO)s that offer the same program in Bangladesh in different forms and names. The providers of MCs claim that the overwhelming majority of the borrowers are using the loan funds profitably for productive purposes, repaying the loans and interest regularly, and thus improving their socio-economic conditions steadily. The findings of the present study are somewhat contrary and disturbing to the claim of the MC programs. This study finds that a bulk of the MC is borrowed for non productive purposes. About one quarter of the borrowers use the credit exclusively for consumption and debt repayment purposes. Nearly half of them use the credits entirely for investment purposes. For all, the return on investment is very meager. About two-third of the borrowers, on average have an impressive 83% net return on investment available for payment of interest and dividend in addition to the principal. But in case of as high as one third of them, average return on investment is not enough even to cover the most minimum or tolerance level of wages for family labors, let alone paying any interest and making any profit after keeping aside the principal.",TRUE,FALSE,implicit cost of labor|microcredit|microenterprise|Microlending|small business,2019-02-20T19:29:02.447801,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T19:28:14.585095,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/citation/,xh9na,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9hq4g/,9hq4g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d150d62c82a001ad6442b/,5c6d150d62c82a001ad6442b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xh9na/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xh9na,https://doi.org/10.2753/0577-5132510608

In analyzing the effectiveness of microcredit program the microcredit providers (NGOs) use accounting profit of the borrowers’ enterprises ignoring implicit costs on the plea that the opportunity cost of labor is near zero in those countries. This plea is certainly not tenable. In this research we use the principle of economic profit taking into account the implicit cost of family labor. From the results of this pilot study we get the reflection that a bulk of the microcredit is borrowed for non productive purposes. As high as 24% of borrowers used the credit exclusively for consumption and debt repayment purposes, and therefore demand for payment of interest from them is nonsensical. Only 48 % of the borrowers used the credits entirely for investment purposes. However, they are faced with very low-return investment opportunities in rural areas. About 68% of them on average had an impressive 83% net return on investment available for payment of interest and dividend. But in case of as high as 32% of them average return on investment was not enough even to cover the most minimum or tolerance level of wages for family labors. In their cases any payment of interest for capital has to be at the expense of the sacrifice of this subsistence level wages of the family labors. They are trapped in a vicious circle of loans. In the absence of a built in mechanism for debt relief they have no scope to be freed from this bondage of debt. An Islamic microcredit model based on Mudarabah principle (whereby the lender and borrower share the business surplus/profit on an agreed ratio, but in case of loss the lender alone bears the loss) may be a better alternative for them. There are indications that it requires an investment of around Tk 12,000 for creating job opportunity for one rural labor for the whole year.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-20T14:36:41.668607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T14:32:16.126396,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/citation/,hgpvk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m2g69/,m2g69,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d135462c82a0019d69352/,5c6d135462c82a0019d69352,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgpvk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hgpvk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hgpvk,NA

By applying OLS and Unit Root test, the estimated value is used to determine the casual relationship between interest rates and inflation for the monthly sample period of August 1996 to December 2003. The empirical results suggest that there does not exist any co-movement of inflation with interest rates and the relationship between the variables is also not significant for Bangladesh.

In this context this paper tries to find evidence supporting the reality of weak-form efficiency of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) by examining the issues of market risk-return relationship and market depth or liquidity for DSE.

Eventually Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which envisages the relationship between risk and the expected rate of return on a risky security, is found unrelated in DSE market. As proper risk-return relationships of the market is seems to be deficient in DSE and the market is not liquid, interest of the available investors are bring into being very insignificant.

Nevertheless, it is still a field of knowledge which has not been fully differentiated from its crisis –mainly- because an exhaustive ontological categorical demand has not been made. From the analysis of Ian Parker’s La Critical Discourse Psychology (CDP) and Critical Psychology, we observed that the causes and consequences of the introduction of Scientific realism as an intermediate stage in the elaboration of what has been called radical meta-psychological project or a general critic of psychology. We reviewed, from the quantitative method Multi-RPYS References, an approximate of 51 papers and 10 books of Ian Parker's work analyzed by the web program RPYS i/o. From the start, CDP and PCL avoided the short form of the critic, which is barely a differentiation from the totality of dominant psychology. Instead, they announced, implicitly, some methodological and theoretical tools which could be useful to prevent its definite adhesion to post-modernism, where ""anything goes"" is its most manifest condition.",TRUE,FALSE,Critic|Critical Realism|Discourse|Latin American|Psychology,2019-02-20T13:22:23.164165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T13:05:59.184027,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/citation/,yf5gk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6c68e582a3950018c7ba57/,5c6c68e582a3950018c7ba57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yf5gk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yf5gk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yf5gk,NA
