It also aimed to know the size of that effectiveness. The participants of the study were 62 and they were divided equally into two groups; the experimental one studied the course with the intervention of the instructional scaffolding strategies and the control group studied the same course without any intended focus on the instructional scaffolding. The study adopted the pre-post design; average scores of the participants were calculated using T-test.  The ratio of effectiveness was calculated using the Modified Black's Gain Ratio. Results were very promising as they revealed significant improvement in the mean scores of the experimental group in the oral test as T-test value was (5.41). The evidence indicated that using instructional scaffolding strategies was effective as the ratio of effectiveness was (1.06). Results highlighted the real value of instructional scaffolding while teaching oral skills in English class.

This research is conducted to                    describe the correlation between lecturers’ language style and students’ academic. As one of the aspects of forming academic self-efficacy, language style has an important role because someone who can get information verbally about his ability in mastering certain duty tends to do more efforts. In addition, it makes him more diligent in doing a duty. Also, language style positively increases the student's self-confidence and vice verse. This research involves seventy students who fill in the questionnaire about the lecturer language style and academic self-efficacy scale.  Data were analyzed by using simple linear regression analysis. The result of the research shows that lecturer’s language style has a coefficient of determination of 23.5% towards the students’ academic self-efficacy. Finally, this research affirms that positive lecturer language style can improve the students’ belief towards their ability while the negative language style can weaken the students’ self-efficacy.

It investigates the value of EFL within the Saudi education system and surveys the extent to which English has been adapted to suit the needs and customs of Saudi citizens. While focusing on major policy issues related to planning and implementing EFL instruction, the paper examines how stakeholders have worked to preserve Saudi culture, Arabic, and the structure of Saudi society. It seeks to determine whether EFL courses in Saudi schools meet the needs of students, the results of which are compared with Saudi policies on language teaching. The study then presents observations on the compatibility of teaching practices and policies, as well as the issues involved. Saudi Arabia faces several challenges that have greatly hindered the planning and implementation of language-teaching policies. This study proposes strategies for strengthening these policies to fully achieve the desired objectives.

The development of the pragmatic, integrated method of Communicative Circle builds upon the linguo-didactic, integrated, and activity approaches, and the theory of three levels of awareness of learning. These perspectives are reflected in the integration of listening, reading and speaking skills, three stages of teaching, regarding the psychological phases of awareness of the studied material, and the choice of tasks according to the students’ abilities, basic skills and the tempo of learning. In the course of study students are gradually offered more complicated tasks for training speaking and texts for reading and listening, and the whole teaching process builds upon broadening some professional and scientific knowledge of students at a technical university. The efficiency of the developed Communicative Circle method is verified in the course of a two-year experiment. The results of teaching by the traditional program (developed on the basis of the Federal State Standards) and by the method of the Communicative Circle are compared and evaluated.

To fill this gap, this empirical study investigates the beliefs of Taif University’s teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) about their feedback practices and their perception of the impact that these practices have on students' performance. An opinionnaire of 18 items was designed with closed-ended questions. A five-point Likert’s scale was employed to measure three subscales: teachers’ beliefs and practices about their corrective feedback; types of oral corrective feedback used by EFL teachers; and their perception of students’ uptake. The survey was administered to fifty-seven English as foreign language (EFL) teachers at the English Language Centre (ELC), Taif University who were asked to fill in an online survey regarding their oral corrective feedback practices in the classroom.

From the language classroom comes further the wider social context of university in which EFL students learn outside the formal learning environment in relation to the opportunities to use and to be exposed to the target language. Two data collection methods are employed: questionnaires and interviews. It is revealed that the students perceive that the wider social context indeed influences their learning experiences outside as well as in the language classroom in two major aspects: self-development in English use and drawing on English as a common means of communication or a lingua franca (ELF) whereby there is an implicit search for similarities through English. Many further report that the specific university culture and its environment play a great role in their English learning, motivating or demotivating them to use English for communication.

The theory, which developed in and by contrastivity between 1976 and 2005, is built on the basic assumption that utterances exhibit on their surface observable traces of the utterer's invisible structuring activity. It is  initially derived from a corpus-based approach to English and applied to languages as different as French, Arabic, Turkish, Madagascan, and Kwa languages. The theory's visibility is investigated primarily in relation to its readability and translatability.The findings suggest that visibility retarders and obstructers are more associated with a general context of global scientific publication marked by the hegemony of English as the language of science  than with the theoretical framework itself. However, if the model's body of knowledge and conceptual apparatus lend themselves to smooth interlingual transfer, as shown in books of Metaoperational inspirations in Spanish (Matte Bon (1992)), Italian (Gagliardelli (1999)), English (Adamczewski (2002)), and Arabic (Kahlaoui (2010)), the theory's high degree of formalism and its dense metalinguistic description are in some didactic contexts generative of reader frustration.",TRUE,FALSE,Enunciative approach|metalinguistic status|metaoperational linguistics|readability|translatability|visibility,2019-07-21T21:14:42.228540,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:14:34.084693,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/citation/,27fm8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bccc9a26b3400180a4351/,5d2bccc9a26b3400180a4351,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/27fm8/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/27fm8

Comparing co-authorships and acknowledgements in political science journals from Germany,"Scientific research on academic collaboration focuses on co-authorships, citations and acknowledgements as ‘reward triangle’. However, acknowledgements have received comparatively little attention. In this paper, we compare co-authorship and acknowledgement networks and investigate conditions that influence their formation (gender, institutional affiliation and status of authors and acknowledged individuals). We select three sub-disciplinary political science journals from Germany between 2010 and 2017. We employ techniques from social network analysis to compare these conditions by using homophily measures. The results demonstrate that co-authorships have a rather sparse network while including acknowledgements reveals hidden collaboration structures. Moreover, scholars from the same institution are more likely to co-author and acknowledge each other while we show heterophily effects for acknowledging and co-authoring behavior of professors. We also identify an underrepresentation of female academics as authors and credit-givers alike. Thus, our exploratory study reveals similarities and differences patterns for co-authorships and acknowledgements providing new ground for future studies on all aspects of collaborative behavior in science.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic collaboration|acknowledgements|co-authorship|Germany|political science|social network analysis,2019-07-14T23:06:47.008316,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-14T23:06:20.544415,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/citation/,bg4qz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2b73fd1c5b4a001ca08286/,5d2b73fd1c5b4a001ca08286,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bg4qz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bg4qz

Biases in online listings' representativeness could impact different communities' access to housing search information, reinforcing traditional information segregation patterns through a digital divide. They could also circumscribe housing practitioners' and researchers' ability to draw broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply and affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across the US and finds that they spatially concentrate and over-represent whiter, wealthier, and better-educated communities. Other significant demographic differences exist in age, language, college enrollment, rent, poverty rate, and household size. Most cities' online housing markets are digitally segregated by race and class, and we discuss various implications for residential mobility, community legibility, gentrification, housing voucher utilization, and automated monitoring and analytics in the smart cities paradigm. While Craigslist contains valuable crowdsourced data to better understand affordability and available rental supply in real-time, it does not evenly represent all market segments. The Internet promises information democratization, and online listings can reduce housing search costs and increase choice sets. However, technology access/preferences and information channel segregation can concentrate such information-broadcasting benefits  in already-advantaged communities, reproducing traditional inequalities and reinforcing residential sorting and segregation dynamics. Technology platforms like Craigslist construct new institutions with the power to shape spatial economies, human interactions, and planners' ability to monitor and respond to urban challenges.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|city planning|community|craigslist|critical GIS|demographics|digital divide|displacement|econometrics|gentrification|geospatial|GIS|housing|housing market|housing policy|housing search|housing supply|housing vouchers|inequality|information|neighborhood|regional planning|rental housing|residential mobility|residential sorting|section 8|segregation|smart cities|smart city|spatial econometrics|technology|urban economics|urban planning,2019-07-13T19:17:21.750183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-13T19:17:01.983141,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5a|Law|Housing Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Geoff Boeing,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/citation/,pqgw7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jmkxa/,jmkxa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2a1e1c1c5b4a001c9fe8b2/,5d2a1e1c1c5b4a001c9fe8b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pqgw7/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518X19869678,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pqgw7
