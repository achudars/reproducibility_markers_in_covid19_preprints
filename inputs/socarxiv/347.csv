This chapter attempts to understand what is driving this uncharacteristic focus on the Navy, concentrating on developments in the 20-year period since the end of the Cold War (1991–2011). The analysis proceeds in two parts. The first section examines several different measures, including number of ships, aggregate tonnage, number of missile cells and budgetary allocation to understand the trajectory of the Indian Navy over the past 20 years. Section two examines three oft-cited justifications for naval expansion – defence against hostile maritime powers, the cultivation of power projection capability to further India’s political interests, and the protection of trade – in relation to the fleet’s actual platform acquisitions to determine their relative importance in driving naval development. The available data suggests that the primary mission driving naval modernization is sea-lane security, with the development of ‘softer’ aspects of power projection capability receiving some support, while the need to deter hostile maritime powers does little to explain India’s recent naval modernization. This focus on enhancing India’s ability to provide regional ‘public goods,’ such as sea-lane security and humanitarian response, strongly suggests that this growing naval strength can emerge as a net positive for the region.",TRUE,FALSE,India|Indo-Pacific|navy|power projection|seapower,2019-12-23T17:31:21.343678,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-23T17:30:43.371606,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/citation/,8xf7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e00641afad25100096daa31/,5e00641afad25100096daa31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xf7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xf7y,NA

potential for and limitations of U.S. and Indian cooperation in the region to achieve
shared aims. It argues that extensive diplomatic consultations between the two
countries have led to a significant convergence in their positions on regional
security challenges. Active cooperation, however, remains constrained by a
number of factors, including India’s need to prioritize foreign policy challenges
closer to home, concerns about provoking China, and a discomfort among countries
in Southeast Asia regarding the idea of a joint U.S.-India approach toward the

examining the prospects for bilateral cooperation in Asia. Although peacetime
foreign policy collaboration between major powers is a rarity, China’s rapid rise in
the international system appears to have forced the United States and India into
unprecedentedly close consultation on regional security issues. Will this consultation
mature into active cooperation? To answer this question, this introductory essay first
examines the concept of strategic partnerships—a nebulous type of political
relationship that have proliferated since the end of the Cold War. It then highlights
the obstacles to peacetime cooperation between major powers in other regions of the world. Following this, attention turns to the articles in this special issue which
examine the history of Indo-U.S. cooperation in various sub-regions of Asia.
Collectively, these pieces challenge misperceptions and misunderstandings of each
country’s policies and past behavior, as well as identify the differing understandings
of both the bilateral relationship and the region held by each party. Taken together,
these articles provide a clearer sense of the geopolitical scope and depth, as well as
the important limitations, of the Indo-U.S. strategic partnership. The article

large part because the indiscriminate and heavy-handed tactics employed by the
country’s national police force, the Philippine Constabulary (PC), was a leading
factor driving support for the Huk movement. A key turning point in the campaign
came with the reform and reorganization of the PC, as a result of which the bulk of
the PC’s personnel were transferred into the Army, which was given the lead for the
COIN campaign. Although the idea of a military-led COIN campaign, with the police
in a supporting role, would appear to run counter to the assumptions that inspired

an ineffectual police agency can do in counterinsurgency and the lengths that a

Recent research points to the incentive structures faced by differentially positioned members of a parliamentary party: unlike backbenchers, MPs who hold a ministerial portfolio can use the prerequisites of executive office to shield themselves from the costs of governance. This article tests the theory of executive particularism by examining the electoral fortunes of government ministers in India. Sitting government ministers are found to outperform other candidates, however, tests of causality fail to demonstrate that holding a ministerial portfolio causes this electoral benefit. Instead, it appears that a candidate’s electoral performance enhances the likelihood of being granted a ministerial portfolio in the first place.

A survey was deployed via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) on a randomly selected sample of the inner-Sydney population (n=409). We find that less than half of the participants worry about crime but that a sizable minority (13%) indicated that they have some worry about a category of crime every week of the year or more. Building on a recent conceptual advance Grey et al 2011), we differentiate between functional and dysfunctional fear of crime. We find that greater direct and indirect experience of victimization, believing one’s neighbourhood to be disorderly, and believing that collective efficacy is low all predict moving up the scale from no worry, to functional fear, to increasingly frequent dysfunctional fear. The findings suggest gender and age are largely unrelated to worry about crime, controlling for perceptions of community disorder, perceptions of collective efficacy, direct victimisation experience and indirect victimisation experience.

This report presents trends in personal experiences of and exposure to online hate speech among adult New Zealanders based on nationally representative data. The findings from this study are also compared with results from a similar research study conducted in 2018. In addition, this report explores people’s perceptions about other issues related to hate speech. The goal of this study is to fill some knowledge gaps regarding the extent and nature of hate speech in New Zealand.
