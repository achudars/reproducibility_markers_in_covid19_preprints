Climate capitalism seeks to redirect investments from fossil energy to renewable energy generation, so as to foster an ecological modernization of production and reduce GHG emissions. 
I use social network analysis to assess the potential for climate capitalism, as a project of a section of the corporate elite, to replace the current ‘carboniferous capitalist’ regime. Corporate-funded climate and environmental policy groups (CEPGs) constitute major venues for the corporate elite to assemble and plan their response to the climate crisis. By mapping out the network of board-level interlocks between CEPGs and the largest transnational corporations, I first find that certain CEPGs are centrally located among the global intercorporate network, and thus well positioned to promote climate capitalism among the corporate elite. Second, I delineate a climate capitalist inner circle that includes the individual members of the corporate community who arguably are able to exert the greatest power to shape climate capitalism. However, many of them, close to the oil and nuclear sectors, may support a long-term transition away from fossil fuels, incompatible with avoiding dangerous climatic warming.",TRUE,FALSE,Climate capitalism|Climate change|Climate politics|Environmental sociology|Inner circle|Interlocking directorates|Social network analysis|Transnational corporations,2018-07-02T10:59:31.881648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-10T23:13:50.134314,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Author,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/citation/,7xdfh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8bt56/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/relationships/node/,8bt56,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578d50f1594d9001f28164d7/,578d50f1594d9001f28164d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xdfh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7xdfh/,https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2015.1111490,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7xdfh

In this case, the study addressed: 1) polyrhythmia at different scales produced by algorithms, technology, management and urban life, and; 2) the process of organizing multiple timelines to tune the ‘heartbeat’ of the city. Time is a resource for coordination and regulation, as well as for making sense of actions and experience. Being increasingly dispersed, and black-boxed in a multiplicity of processes affecting and configuring the way the past, present and future are perfomed and lived, time also represents a new object of concern for the ethnographic investigation of algorithmic management. I argue that ethnography allows us to understand the material organizing of dispersed and heterogeneous temporalities while also intersecting with such temporalities. Drawing on Guattari and Deleuze’s concept of ‘refrain’ and from Lefebvre’s ‘rhythmanalysis’, I introduce the concepts of rhythm-making and halfway ethnography with the purpose of accounting for the manufacturing of multiple temporalities and for the time-boundedness that links ethnographic practice and the technological, organizational, and cultural ‘heartbeats’ of fieldwork.

But while this anti-imperialist spirit was no doubt present at Bandung, so were many other spirits, including those of Cold War realpolitik. We consider the different meanings of Bandung by examining the critical role Yugoslavia played in the rise of the Non-Aligned Movement in years that followed the summit. Drawing on primary historical documents, we show that Yugoslav leaders consistently failed to appreciate the racism of the international society and their own racialised privilege in it. They did appreciate, however, that performing solidarity with the decolonised and decolonising nations would bring major status rewards to Yugoslavia in the context of the East-West showdown.

Wisconsin imprisonment rates declined slightly after the mid-2000s, but have risen since 2014. A detailed investigation of patterns of movement into and out of prison by offense and admission type (new sentence vs. revocation) shows that the decline after 2007 was small and the seeds of the rebound after 2012 in incarceration were present in the earlier trends. A steep decline in prison admissions for drug sentences and a decline in prison admissions for revocations after 2007 masked continuing slow rises in imprisonment from new commitments for other offenses, especially rape and murder. After 2012, a rise in revocations across offense groups and a rise in new commitments for drug offenses and several other categories of offenses led to a rise in the total imprisonment rate. The patterns by offense and admission type suggest that changes in violent crime rates and in sentence lengths within offense category play relatively little role in these trends. Total imprisonment trends are products of complex processes affecting different groups differently. Policy recommendations emphasize the drug war, sex offenders, and revocations for technical violations as the areas having the largest numerical impact on trends in imprisonment in Wisconsin. An appendix gives additional details about offenses and admission types. The report itself includes seven color graphs which show trends in imprisonment by offense and category of admission and the appendix includes another 22 color graphs that show the trends for each offense and the offense trends by admission type.

However, the degree to which political communication researchers can live up to this task depends on how systematically they relate their empirical investigations to concerns formulated in normative conceptions of democracy. In this paper, I present a framework for the empirical normative analysis of political communication. Based on the two core research procedures of normative assessment and empirical validation, it provides a model of the relations between normative and empirical research and a template for the empirical study of normatively relevant aspects of political communication. The paper systematizes the relations between normative theory and empirical reality, and discusses the two core procedures for empirical researchers to productively bridge the two.

However, their real role in battle is still a matter of discussion. Historical sources suggest that their impact in the efficiency of the Roman battle line was highly disproportionate to their individual actions, considering their low numbers. In the past decades a number of authors have proposed different descriptive models to explain their relevance, highlighting factors such as an improvement on unit cohesion or high levels of aggressiveness, which made them lead the charges against the enemy. However, the lack of a quantitative framework does not allow to compare and test these working hypotheses.

This paper suggests an innovative methodological approach to explore the problem, based on computer simulation. An Agent-Based Model of roman legions is used as a virtual laboratory, where different hypotheses are tested under varying scenarios. Results suggest that the resilience of formations to combat stress increase exponentially if they contain just a small percentage of homogeneously distributed warriors with higher psychological resistance. Additionally, the model also shows how the lethality of the entire formation is reinforced when this selected group is located at the first line of the formation, even if individually they are not more aggressive or skilled than the average.

The interpretation of the simulated patterns in terms of Roman warfare suggest that the multiple roles of the centurions observed in the sources were not caused by changes in tactics or values, but can be strictly explained by an increase in their experience and overall combat performance.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-Based Models|centurions|military history|Roman history,2018-07-02T10:59:31.125346,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-08T10:48:29.717803,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce4|Arts and Humanities|History|Military History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d29|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d2a|Arts and Humanities|Classics|Classical Archaeology and Art History,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/citation/,cqj4d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c8m6s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/relationships/node/,c8m6s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593929909ad5a1022d610198/,593929909ad5a1022d610198,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cqj4d/,https://doi.org/10.1162/JINH_a_00833,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cqj4d

The OECD adopts a principal of objective behavioral—non-agency—analysis of economic activity, which is impracticable and unworkable. The OECD denies that accurate legal contracts accurately delineate legal relationship. This implies an inherent fraud in corporate business management, which if true would be criminal in most countries—the OECD is implying everything in writing is a lie. The OECD denies the tax implications of principle-agent legal agency relationships as defined by contract law in its transfer pricing recommendations. On the other hand, the U.S. Tax Court still looks to the agency relationships between corporate entities. The U.S. Tax Court follows the correct approach.
Corporate management can be divided between principle and agents. People usually think about management and shareholders, but there are also risk managers and asset managers that can be bifurcated. In terms of management, the bottom of the hierarchy is the managers of the factories. The capital fund managers or the shareholders have all the power—it will be taxed here not at the managers of the factories. The managers at the top of the hierarchy will get the highest level of remuneration. Reliance on contract is the only way that makes sense. Tax is based on legal—rather than equitable—matters. How would one tax equity?
Two polar opposites define the alternative approaches to the proper appraisal of income for purposes of taxation for transfer pricing.  On the one hand, the United States Tax Court has focused largely on contractual language and terms of agreement. On the other, hand the OECD through BEPS jurisdictions (most of the rest of the world where policies have been formulated) choose to analyze actual economic behavior and reality independent of the mere words chosen by the parties.
Globalization and technology have greater importance in our daily lives every day. As technology and industrial processes grow every day, technology leads to greater globalization, and greater globalization of supply chains leads to more efficient and efficient technology. For example, years ago, heart problems would lead to death, but now small “battery” type instruments (pacemakers) can prevent heart attacks. The examples of the health benefits from technology are endless.
As technology becomes greater and more efficient, globalization has also created supply chains and industrial production processes that are no longer local. As global supply chains increase in complexity, profits need to be properly allocated to certain jurisdictions for taxation purposes—to raise revenue support government functions for society’s benefit. This is a fundamental issue of international taxation. The leading principle for the allocation is the arm’s length principle, according to which related enterprises must charge prices that would have been charged in the open market. Although the principle’s goal aims at avoiding profit shifting, multinational enterprises for years used to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions to avoid taxes in high tax jurisdictions. In the early part of the 21st century increased to attention to these phenomena has lead to the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project to combat this harmful tax competition. This is the most groundbreaking change to the international tax treaty framework since the 1920s—that was initially set up to facilitate cross-border trade. This BEPS project has led to fundamental proposals—as a type of model law—to change the international tax system.",TRUE,FALSE,International LAw|International Tax|International Tax Law|Law|Public International Law|Tax|Taxation|Transfer Pricing,2018-07-02T10:59:30.923205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-07T21:39:44.820358,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1e|Law|Taxation-Transnational,Charles Lincoln,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/citation/,3fs5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zfrxs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/relationships/node/,zfrxs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59387258b83f6902297c7b46/,59387258b83f6902297c7b46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3fs5x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3fs5x
