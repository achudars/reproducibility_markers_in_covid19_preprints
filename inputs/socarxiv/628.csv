Some find a job quickly - others do not. Delays in the transition from education to work have been associated with scarring effects and detrimental effects on later employment and career progression. Increasing numbers of graduates from universities and colleges are descendants of immigrants. The labor market performance of children of immigrants arguably constitutes an important test of the long-term structural integration of ethnic minorities. Using comprehensive Norwegian administrative data on complete birth cohorts, we apply discrete time hazard regression to examine ethnic inequalities in relative transition rates from education to work, comparing majority graduates to ten groups of immigrant descendants from the 1973 to 1997 birth cohorts (N = 964,450 persons with 1,901,171 person-years). We find clear evidence of ethnic inequalities in transition rates, where children of immigrants or African origin fare the worst. Second, supply side factors do not seem very relevant for ethnic inequalities in the transition from education to work; as the overall patterns mostly remains unaffected when adjusted for factors like educational field, family obligations and parental background.

The Consolidation of Cultural Values among EU Member States and Candidates,"The European Union (EU) is considered a unique economic and political union that integrates most European countries. This article focuses on the cultural aspect of European integration, which has been increasingly debated over the course of deepening and widening integration and in the context of the legitimation crisis of the EU. Among the main goals of the EU is to promote certain values, which raises the question of whether it has been efficient in (or enabled) reducing cultural value gaps among the participating countries. World polity and institutional isomorphism theories suggest that cultural values may trickle down in a vertical manner from the institutions of the EU to its member states and candidates. Furthermore, hybridization theory postulates that values diffuse horizontally through intensified interactions enabled by the EU. These two perspectives imply the possibility of cultural convergence among countries associated with the EU. By contrast, the culture clash thesis assumes that differences in cultural identity prevent value convergence across countries; growing awareness of such differences may even increase the pre-existing cultural value distances. To test these different scenarios, I compare distances in emancipative and secular values across pairs of countries (Welzel 2013) using combined repeated cross-sectional data from the EVS and WVS gathered between 1992 and 2011. I find that the longer a country has been part of the EU, the more closely its values approximate those of the EU founding countries, which in turn are the most homogenous. Initial cultural distance to the founders’ average values appears irrelevant to acquiring membership or candidacy status. However, new member states experienced substantial cultural convergence with old member states after 1992, as did current candidates between 2001 and 2008. Since 1992, nations not participating in the integration process have diverged substantially from EU members, essentially leading to cultural polarization in Europe. The findings are independent of (changes in) economic disparities and suggest the importance of cultural diffusion as one of the fundamental mechanisms of cultural change. This empirical study contributes to the literature on European integration, political and sociological theories of globalization, and cross-cultural theories of societal value change.",TRUE,FALSE,Culture|Diffusion|European integration,2018-07-02T11:36:44.549701,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-24T16:53:38.528465,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/citation/,b4p79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4x8fc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/relationships/node/,4x8fc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a68a9ee630114000db02be6/,5a68a9ee630114000db02be6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4p79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b4p79/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b4p79,NA

Finding Voters That Use Candidate Localness As A Cue For Their Vote Choices,"The literature on candidate selection has found that voters favour local candidates, as they are thought to be more apt to represent their constituents. An important caveat is that it requires for a voter to have knowledge of the candidates’ characteristics, and to value localism. Previous research concentrates on candidate characteristics, leaving unanswered the question of who considers localism to be important when making their vote choices. This research fills the gap by showing that not all voters care in the same degree and magnitude about localism. We test this argument analysing data from the British Election Survey 2015 using multilevel models. Results show that voters who feel stronger about their distinctive regional identities care significantly more about localism. Additionally, this effect is different when the party system includes a party that explicitly channels these feelings, suggesting that the advantage of local candidates is dependent on the context of party competition.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:36:43.901761,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-24T16:52:37.353343,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/citation/,j5rpy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vytcj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/relationships/node/,vytcj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a67c7ff3623a3000d61f88c/,5a67c7ff3623a3000d61f88c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5rpy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j5rpy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j5rpy,NA

After presenting a typical Bitcoin transaction workflow, a general blockchain state representation is derived. It is demonstrated that the proper mathematical object defining the state of a blockchain is a topological fiber bundle, because it is not possible to globally `parametrize' blocks (or ledgers of blocks) by time due to their dependence upon cryptographic hash functions. In addition, we specify a general transition function between blockchain states that is agnostic to the consensus mechanism used to write blocks into the ledger, and which is probabilistic in nature, so that blockchain may be regarded as a probabilistic state machine. We then interpret agents (both human and code-based, such as `chaincode', `smart contracts', or other artificial intelligence) as automata interacting with blockchain technology, drawing upon the theory of non-cooperative repeated interaction games.

While the spatial concentration of the poor is undoubtedly an important aspect of the story around urban inequality, concentrated poverty research suffers from a number of conceptual and methodological shortcomings. Through a case study of concentrated poverty and affluence in Lexington, Kentucky, this paper draws on relational socio-spatial theory and critical GIS in order to offer a constructive critique of conventional concentrated poverty research. The paper demonstrates that while concentrated poverty and affluence are both on the rise in recent years, concentrated affluence actually represents a more widespread problem within the city. At the same time, the paper visualizes how these processes are fundamentally interconnected and co-produced through property ownership relations, where the extraction of rents from areas of concentrated poverty works to simultaneously produce areas of concentrated affluence elsewhere in the city.",TRUE,FALSE,concentrated poverty|critical GIS|relational socio-spatial theory|segregation|urban inequality,2018-07-02T11:36:42.392274,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-22T20:33:32.606877,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/citation/,g84dz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w62j8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/relationships/node/,w62j8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a65f2e1b52145000f76af48/,5a65f2e1b52145000f76af48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g84dz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g84dz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g84dz,NA
