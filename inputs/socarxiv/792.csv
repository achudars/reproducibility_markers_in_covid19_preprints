Analysts doing cluster analysis sometimes want the data to tell them the optimum number of clusters. Common ""stopping rules"" use the Calinski-Harabasz pseudo-F statistic and Duda-Hart indices, which are based on squared Euclidean distances between cases. Cluster analysis operates on a pairwise matrix of distances between the objects clusters, which are usually created from the observed variables. However, approaches such as expert judgement or algorithmic pattern-recognition (as used for instance in sequence analysis) often output matrices of pairwise similarity or difference whose relationship to the observed variables is much less direct. Built-in Stata utilities allow calculation of the CH and DH indices when cluster analysis starts from variables, but not with cluster analysis that starts from a pairwise distance matrix (unless the distances are squared Euclidean distances defined on variables which are still available). In this note I present two small Stata utilities that will calculate the CH and DH statistics from the distance matrix, if the distances are squared Euclidean. If the distances have another metric, these utilities can be seen as calculating a pseudo-CH pseudo-F or pseudo-DH statistic, potentially extending their use to new applications.

When the FCC proposed allowing low-power devices to use UHF ""white
spaces"" on a license exempt basis, they were unsure whether spectrum
monitoring or geo-database lookup would be the best way to manage the
devices' frequency selection. Since these methods were discussed as
alternatives, few people noticed that they have very different
political implications. Effective sensing of the local radio spectrum
can lead to autonomous, self-managing devices. These reduce the need
for strict government controls over spectrum access, making such
devices a force for liberalization. On the other hand, a radio which
simply follows instructions given by a database, and which must
regularly renew its permission to operate, is a slave, and it is
described that way in white space standards and regulatory documents.
Far from being a force for liberalization, database slaves represent a
drastic extension of regulatory control into the radio domain which
has been the freest (license exemption).

White space devices are expected to reduce the cost and increase the
availability of broadband access in rural areas. But if these devices
depend on geo-database lookup, the temporary but total cutoffs of
Internet access in Egypt, Libya and Syria should make one wonder if it
is wise to give government-sanctioned control centers a “kill switch”
for public broadband access. Geo-database management can yield many
benefits. But it entails a degree of political risk which could be
dangerous in some contexts. It can also delay or even block the
development of the truly autonomous ""smart"" radios needed for
minimalist regulation.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:31.822165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-19T12:14:57.338000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/citation/,94gkw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2weqf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/relationships/node/,2weqf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578e19c2594d9001f281655e/,578e19c2594d9001f281655e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94gkw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/94gkw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/94gkw

This is a background paper for an ITU Workshop on ""Market Mechanisms

summarizes the Open Spectrum Foundation's global survey of Wi-Fi

countries. It proposes a new ITU Study Question on how to reconcile
the growing recognition of licence-free radio bands as a ""best
practice"" in spectrum management with the long-standing rule (now
found in S18.1 of the International Radio Regulations) that all
nongovernment radio transmitters must be licenced. Finally, it
discusses the implications of regulators having the ability to create
new authorisation classes in the gap between licenced and unlicenced.
That shifts the debate between proponents of (unlicenced) ""open

property - onto unstable, unfamiliar ground. It could lead to
""multi-dimensional bidding"" in spectrum auctions - as is found
sometimes in government procurement tenders where bidders can combine

Published in EastBound, Vol. 1, March 13, 2006

For nearly a century, governments have imposed detailed limits on the
use of radio - who can use what frequencies and waveforms, at what
power levels, in which locations, for what purposes. Licenses
summarize these controls for specific users or stations. State control
of radio use goes far beyond what is accepted for other media,
(publishing, photography, Internet, speech, etc.). Most people think
this is necessary to control interference; others felt that
broadcasting was too powerful a social influence to be left
unregulated.

But recently, there has been explosive growth in short-range, personal
uses of radio - Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cordless phones, etc. The arguments
used to justify radio licensing seem inappropriate for such low-power
devices. In fact, government regulation of purely personal, informal
communications is unnecessarily intrusive and politically risky. Many
countries now allow some short-range wireless devices to be used
without a license in specific bands. In general, smarter radios go a
long way toward solving problems that once seemed to require rigid
government controls, giving rise to the open spectrum movement.

At the same time, digitalisation and the widening use of TCP/IP make
it possible to transmit nearly any content through any channel. We use
our mobile phones to take photographs, send text messages and watch
videoclips. Our cable television networks provide Internet access.
Seeping out of their original contexts, dissimilar media traditions
now mix and clash in interconnecting, hybrid networks. In this
situation, it is crucially important to the future of human
communication which regulatory norms emerge as default choices and
dominant models. Will it be broadcasting, telephony, publishing,

Using country-level data from multiple sources (N=181) and multilevel data from 58 countries in the World Values Survey (N=83,301), I document a strong negative relationship between societal secularism and both country-level fertility rates and individual-level fertility behavior. Secularism, even in small amounts, is associated with population stagnation or even decline, whereas highly religious countries have higher fertility rates that promote population growth. This country-level pattern is driven by more than aggregate lower fertility of secular individuals. In fact, societal secularism is a better predictor of highly religious individuals’ fertility behavior than that of secular individuals, and this pattern is largely a function of cultural values related to gender, reproduction, and autonomy in secular societies. Beyond their importance for the religious composition of the world population, the patterns presented in this study are relevant to key fertility theories and could help account for below-replacement fertility.",TRUE,FALSE,ASA2016|socarxiv|Working Paper,2018-07-02T10:51:48.813367,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-19T05:46:40.923000,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp|https://www.thearda.com/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/citation/,pvwpy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ey2ru/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/relationships/node/,ey2ru,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578da7546c613b01ef15cf54/,578da7546c613b01ef15cf54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvwpy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pvwpy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pvwpy
