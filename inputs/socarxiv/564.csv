It is an attempt to answer if there is a statistical significance difference between the experimental and control groups' scores on the speaking test due to the teaching method (role-play strategy vs. the Teacher's Book instructions). A total of 86 homogeneous participants were selected through a random sampling technique from two sections at Lameece Secondary School for Girls in Amman, Jordan during the second semester of the academic year 2016-2017. The experimental group was 42 students while the control group was 44 students. For data collection, a role-play instructional program based on the speaking activities in Action Pack 10, a speaking test and a rating scale were used. The collected data were analyzed using proper statistical measures such as ANCOVA and MANCOVA. The results revealed that the role-play strategy had a significant effect on the five components of the speaking skill with the students of the experimental group.

Among the well-known endeavors in this regard is the morphological annotation of the Quranic Arabic Corpus (QAC) which was carried out in Leeds University, UK. In addition, researchers in the University of Haifa had previously implemented a computational system for the morphological analysis of the Qur'an. More recently, a new Quranic corpus has been built in Mohammed I University in Morocco. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only three studies to produce a morphologically analyzed part-of-speech tagged Qur'an encoded as a structured linguistic database. This paper surveys the morphological analysis in the above-mentioned annotation projects and compares between them to test the quality of their analysis using five criteria related to display of the text in the corpus, word segmentation, morphological disambiguation, part of speech (POS) tag set and manual verification. The paper concludes that the QAC of Leeds and the Quranic corpus of Morocco surpass the Quranic corpus of Haifa with regard to most of these criteria. Furthermore, some additional POS tags for derivative nouns are suggested in a step to reach a more fine-grained tag set that could be proposed for POS tagging of Qur'anic Arabic.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic morphological analysis|Arabic POS tagging|corpus annotation|corpus linguistics|the Glorious Qur'an,2018-07-02T11:31:08.960453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:29:27.408691,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/citation/,wgt9x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8jde7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/relationships/node/,8jde7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a459d76b794960013afc200/,5a459d76b794960013afc200,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wgt9x/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wgt9x

Its sample consisted of 50 male students randomly chosen from Training Center and Community Service at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia, and assigned to experimental and control groups of 25 students per each. Its data were gathered within a two- month period using a pre-post-test design for equivalent groups. The researcher taught both groups deliberately using contrasting instructional approaches; the first were solely exposed to textbook content, excluding all visual aids throughout the process; whereas the second had authentic videos incorporated. As his work pressed ahead,  these methodological techniques  variably had a visible influence on the trainees' in-class interactivity, attentiveness, and keenness to grasp information.

While many quasi-experimental studies confirm efficacy and positive student attitudes towards these types of tools, little is known about existing teaching practices that utilize messaging tools in tertiary contexts, or the attitudes of students or instructors towards them. This qualitative study investigates the use of WhatsApp, one popular messaging application, in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) through examining the attitudes of Preparatory Year students and faculty members at a university in the central-north of Saudi Arabia. Thematic analysis of focus group interviews indicated that WhatsApp is used in EFL instruction for information exchange, language learning support, and language practice. This is achieved through teacher-directed learning, peer learning, and autonomous learning instructional strategies. Thematic analysis also identified the affordances and affective outcomes of using WhatsApp. Student and faculty attitudes towards WhatsApp were positive although some faculty members expressed reservations towards its use. It is argued that applications such as WhatsApp should be leveraged to encourage autonomous and peer learning, repositioning instructors as facilitators, and to develop learning communities.

It is questioning why Sudanese tertiary students are unable to express themselves efficiently and comfortably. This seems crucial and imperative for a college student and it shouldn’t shape any obstacle as a prerequisite for future development. Accordingly, this paper poses a significant issue that every learner of English needs to ponder. To collect data for the study, three tools has been used; a questionnaire, an interview and an observational checklist. The questionnaire was distributed throughout the students of second, third and fourth year university students who had been selected from different Sudanese universities. The collected data is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Data analysis has shown that dialogic teaching enables students to develop the skills of argumentation, questioning and debate which contribute to the development of their critical thinking and speaking skills. Generally, the findings indicate that authentic dialogic teaching components are effective if students are given enough time to practice its skills. Hence recommendations for exposing learners to a variety of medium of speaking like dialogues, debate, argumentation and questioning are made to facilitate teachers to be more well-informed with dialogic teaching approach.",TRUE,FALSE,dialogic teaching|English language learners|speaking skill critical thinking skills,2018-07-02T11:31:08.823439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:30:36.370366,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/citation/,d6euf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s25q7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/relationships/node/,s25q7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4599aeb794960012aff295/,5a4599aeb794960012aff295,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d6euf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d6euf

Aim of the study is to measure possible selves of new teachers that they expect to become and/or fear becoming in the near feature.  In order to achieve this goal, ‘New Teacher Possible Selves Questionnaire’ (Hamman, Wang &amp; Burley, 2013; Dalioğlu &amp; Adıgüzel, 2015) was used to measure EFL teacher candidates’ expected and feared teacher possible-selves. A six-point Likert type scale of questionnaire on possible selves was applied to 149 pre-service EFL teachers from two universities.

The traditional English teaching method cannot produce fluent English speakers. English teaching methodologies, such as English-only and Communicative Language Teaching (CLT), have been widely adopted as practical and the best way to acquire English speaking proficiency in children English language schools, to the point where they are taken for granted by many Taiwanese people. The central argument of this study is that the evaluation of the so-called the-best-English-teaching-method in children English language schools and as common practice in Taiwanese society is ideological. To explore the ideological concept of the-best-English-teaching-method used in children English language schools, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was employed to analyze data drawn from children English language schools’ promotional materials or advertisements. The results indicate the promotion of the-best-English-teaching-method by children English language schools has resulted in social injustice, such as native speaker ideology, native and non-native division, white and non-white division, and English proficiency gap in the rich and the poor and urban and rural areas.

It argues that the mismatch in Case value between the two nominal constituents – the DP “subject” and the DP or AP predicate - of verbless copular clauses is incompatible with the claim that a single probe can simultaneously agree with more than one goal. Rather, the Case phenomenon within the copular contexts considered appears to be consistent with, and follows from, an Agree relation between a single active probe and a single active matching goal.  Some SA copular clauses which include a modal-like negative element - laysa - will also be used to address the key issue under investigation.",TRUE,FALSE,agree|ⱷ-features|goal|multiple agree|probe,2018-07-02T11:31:08.663039,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:10:41.944798,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/citation/,yufka,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3awrj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/relationships/node/,3awrj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45795f67d19e000f6a3616/,5a45795f67d19e000f6a3616,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yufka/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yufka

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and longitudinal multilevel dyad models, this study investigated how educational assortative mating shaped income dynamics in couples over the marital life course. Based on educational assortative mating, couples were grouped into three categories—educational hypergamy (wives less educated than their husbands), homogamy, and hypogamy (wives more educated than their husbands). Results showed that change in husbands’ income with marital duration was similar across couples, whereas change in wives’ income varied by educational assortative mating such that wives in educational hypogamy exhibited more positive change in income over the marital life course. The findings underscored the asymmetric nature of spousal influence and gender change in heterosexual marriages.",TRUE,FALSE,Educational Assortative Mating|Gender|Income Trajectory|Life Course|Marriage|NLSY79,2018-07-02T11:31:07.773255,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-28T03:02:51.337545,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/citation/,cyexg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/45xa9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/relationships/node/,45xa9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a443e6bb794960011b10f1c/,5a443e6bb794960011b10f1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyexg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cyexg/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12470,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cyexg

Using valuable, new data from the 2016 Survey of the Fertility Decision-Making Processes in Chinese Families, we examine the relationship between couple dynamics and women’s fertility autonomy in urban China. If women want no more than one child and already have one, intending to have a second birth indicates low fertility autonomy. Couple dynamics are measured by conjugal power structure and spousal pressure on fertility. We find that only if women have less marital power than their husbands, greater fertility pressure from husband is associated with a higher likelihood that women intend to have a second birth. In addition, when investigating the determinants of couple dynamics, we find that women’s marital power depends on their relative resources, whereas fertility pressure from husband persists regardless. The findings suggest that in post-reform urban China, growing gender inequalities in labor markets likely reduce women’s marital power, which in turn negatively affects their fertility autonomy. We urge greater research and policy attention to gender equality issues in the era of the universal two-child policy.",TRUE,FALSE,China|fertility|fertility autonomy|fertility intention|gender|marital power|the universal two-child policy,2018-07-02T11:31:07.739108,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-28T03:01:32.011475,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/citation/,ksvgh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pcyzr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/relationships/node/,pcyzr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a44373f67d19e000d6bbc9d/,5a44373f67d19e000d6bbc9d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksvgh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ksvgh/,https://doi.org/10.1080/21620555.2018.1428895,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ksvgh
