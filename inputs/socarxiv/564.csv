Comparing Theories of the Reverse Income-Obesity Gradient in the U.S. and South Korea,"In high-income countries, poverty is often associated with higher average body mass index (BMI). To account for this reverse gradient, deprivation theories posit that declining economic resources make it more difficult to maintain a healthy weight. By contrast, discrimination theories argue that anti-fat discrimination in hiring and marriage sorts heavier individuals into lower-income households. We assess competing predictions of these theories by examining how household income in representative samples from South Korea (2007–2014, N=20,823) and the U.S. (1999–2014, N=6,395) is related to BMI in two key contrasting groups: (1) currently married and (2) never married individuals. Naïve analyses that aggregate these two groups reveal the well-established reverse gradient. Stratified analyses, on the other hand, reveal that the gradient only appears among currently married women, but not never-married women or men. Further analyses indicated that these differences in the gradient by marital status cannot be accounted for a number of alternative hypothesis based on differential employment or motivation to lose weight. Though consistent with predictions of anti-fat discrimination in marriage, these findings raise important challenges to deprivation theories of the reverse gradient.",TRUE,FALSE,body mass index|income|KNHANES|NHANES|obesity|reverse gradient,2018-07-27T11:09:01.223561,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-27T11:08:48.380785,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",SeungYong Han|Daniel J.

A Cautionary Tale,"In studies of educational achievement, students' self-reported number of books in the family home is a frequently used proxy for social, cultural, and economic background. Absent hard evidence about what this variable captures or how well, its use has been motivated by strong associations with student outcomes. I show that these associations rest on two types of endogeneity: low achievers accrue fewer books, and are also prone to underestimate their number. The conclusion is substantiated both by comparing reports by students and their parents, and by the fact that girls report on average higher numbers despite being similar to boys on other measures of social background. The endogenous bias is large enough to overturn classical attenuation bias; it distorts cross-country patterns and invalidates many common study designs.

Using Beijing and Shanghai as case studies, this paper draws on 32 in-depth semi-structured interviews with municipal government officials, academics, and transportation professionals to explore the city-level transportation policymaking process in China. Across the two cities, we identify three common contributors – policy learning, data informatization, and public opinion – and four obstacles – public complaint, unilateral decisionmaking, inadequate coordination among relevant departments, and lack of adaptiveness in policy implementation practice – to adopting timely and appropriate transportation policies. We then introduce a processual model that connects the contributors and obstacles identified within the flow of transportation policy among key actors in city-level government. This process shows how transportation policymaking in Chinese megacities is often reactive to public outcry over a transportation problem. This problem is investigated by a technical government research center that reports to the municipal transport committee. This committee then assesses public opinion and submits a policy recommendation to city government leadership, who make the final policy decision. Based on both case studies, we discuss potential recommendations for how to better enable transportation policymaking at the city level in China through more formalized processes of policy experimentation and public participation.

Knowing the conditions that make people vulnerable to this threat is vitally important. Yet, socioeconomic and demographic data are not consistently available at the tornado level making it hard to obtain this knowledge. In response to this limitation, here a method to estimate socioeconomic and demographic variables in a consistent manner at the tornado level for historical events is implemented and assessed. The daysmetric method uses data from the 1990 and 2000 Census, as well as the 2010 American Community Survey together with tornado reports over the period 1995--2016. Results show that a typical casualty-producing tornado affects 34 people with an interquartile range between 4 and 198 people. Results also show that the 2 July 1997 Detroit, Michigan tornado with its 90 known injuries likely affected over 101,752 people. Comparisons between estimates using the actual path and a simplified modeled path show strong correspondence (percent errors averaging less than 10%) and estimates compare favorably (correlations exceeding .90) with known demographic numbers from a sample of tornadoes indicating the procedure provides useful information for statistical studies of tornado vulnerability.

Nevertheless, research regarding the perceived causes of wealth has been so far sidelined and not related to the study of poverty attributions. This paper focuses on the relationship between poverty and wealth attributions from a latent variable measurement perspective, for which it considers two basic attribution types: internal (based on individual behavior) and external (based on socio-structural determinants). The data comes from a 10-indicator scale from the national representative survey “Social Justice and Citizenship Participation”, applied in Chile in 2013 (N=1.245). Based in previous exploratory and confirmatory studies, a factorial confirmatory model for internal and external attributions of both poverty an wealth was estimated (four factors), based on which a second order two-factor confirmatory model was estimated, one for internal and one for external attributions, for both poverty and wealth. The results show for the first time evidence of common attributional dimensions for poverty and wealth.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-26T13:47:21.198562,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-26T13:47:09.036630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/citation/,5xnrd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qns7r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/relationships/node/,qns7r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b5890a9b0edc9001176c796/,5b5890a9b0edc9001176c796,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5xnrd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5xnrd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5xnrd,NA

Yet “open” research instruments have understudied socioeconomic, organizational, and political dynamics, describing distinctive modes of participation in scientific knowledge infrastructures. In this paper, I describe the CERN “Open Hardware” initiative with a focus on the exchange practices and technologies of participation that were mobilized to assemble a critical infrastructure with distributed teams at research centers, companies, and Internet-based projects. Drawing from ethnographic and archival research of collaborative and competitive dynamics around “Open Hardware” at CERN, I examine how “open” scientific tools and infrastructures are designed, disputed, and implemented following Free and Open Source development models. In questioning “openness” both at the level of technical objects and their technical collectives, I examine the usage of Open Hardware for validating and assessing research results as well as rendering scientific projects more permeable to new modes of participation in the making of the“technoscience by other means.” --- Paper submitted for the ""Colloque annuel de l’IFRIS 2018,"" Université Paris VI, France.",TRUE,FALSE,anthropology of science|CERN|free software|open hardware|open science|open source|open source hardware,2018-07-25T13:47:02.163988,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-25T13:46:38.025724,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/citation/,tqwef,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2t4cq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/relationships/node/,2t4cq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b576633da105100109a83c5/,5b576633da105100109a83c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqwef/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqwef/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqwef,NA
