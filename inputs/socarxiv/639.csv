Much of the problem lies with the new potential for constant social comparisons. Social media also adds a new layer of interaction that can occur anywhere, at any time, with anyone. This allows for a higher quantity of relationships, but strips the depth of these relationships. Does increased social media use affect quality of life? I hypothesize that the more social media sites a respondent is a member or regular user of, the more time he or she reports feeling depressed or lonely. I used a sample of 628 respondents as part of in-person interviews conducted by the 2016 General Social Survey. The results found that overall about 51 percent of the people claimed to feel depressed or lonely none of the time. Meaning that about half of respondents do feel depressed or lonely at least some of the time. The most statistically significant finding revealed that the higher ones income, the less one reports feeling depressed or lonely. However, the hypothesis must be rejected because there is no statistical significance between social media usage and quality of life. Social media site usage does not result in increased feelings of depression or loneliness. Based on the income results, does money buy happiness? Those of lower socio-economic class may not have access to proper medical care and therefore do not get adequate treatment for mental illnesses.

The sexual violence perpetrated against women had been brutal, and it had resulted in physical and social destruction and psychological trauma. Nottage’s choice to set Ruined in the Democratic Republic of Congo was guided by the severe attitude towards women during the civil war, portraying the female characters as the victims of the war. The study is a brief description of women's situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, it concerns of how the female playwright Lynn Nottage depicts Congolese women’s social struggles, psychological traumas, and physical destruction. The research also discusses the motives and the purposes of writing about a sensitive subject as the violence against women. Consequently, it applies a feminist reading of the text, and it is supported by numerous academic journals, books, articles, and reports from international organizations.

This study analyzes the relationships between time spent consuming television and Internet, where a respondent gets their news from (television vs. Internet), and confidence in these institutions.  I predict an inverse relationship between exposure to television and Internet and confidence in media and government.  I further hypothesize that people who get their news primarily from the Internet have less confidence in these institutions than those who get their news from television.  I test this relationship using a sample of 370 respondents from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) dataset, controlling for race, gender, political views, education, respondents' family income at the age of 16, and age.  OLS regression analysis shows that more hours spent watching television positively impacts confidence in media, and that those who get their news from the Internet have less confidence in the media, as do conservatives, regardless of media consumption.  No independent variables determine confidence in government, which is only associated negatively with being conservative.  A second regression model using confidence in press instead of media shows that females are significantly less likely to trust the press and that people of color are significantly more likely to trust the press.  The relationships from the first model retained their significance.  This model shows a higher significance level for the conservative relationship.

Under the theoretical framework of interactionism theory of conversion, which posits that the interplay between active, negotiated, and socially constructed aspects of human behavior and different aspects of social context lead to religious conversion, I propose that economic mobility and income affect whether or not one chooses to switch religions from the one in which they were raised. I rely on the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) that was administered to 2,867 randomly selected adults living in households in the United States in 2016. I analyze data from a subset of 1,068 married respondents to examine the effects of economic mobility, income, exogamy, geographic mobility, education, race, age, and sex on religious mobility and apostasy. There are no significant correlations between economic mobility and income with religious mobility or apostasy. The only significant predictor of religious mobility and apostasy is exogamy. Respondents who have married outside of the religion in which they were raised are more likely to be religiously mobile or abandon religion altogether than those who are endogamous. Additionally, older respondents are less likely to abandon religion than younger respondents. My hypothesis is not supported. However, the results support interactionism theory of conversion as exogamy is a significant predictor of religious mobility. These results confirm that the institution of marriage plays a significant role in whether or not someone converts religions; furthermore, the bonds of marriage outweigh one’s bond to the religion in which they were raised.",TRUE,FALSE,inter-religious marriage|religious conversion|religious identity,2018-07-02T11:29:51.078836,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-17T15:11:39.087765,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,Ruby Thompson,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/citation/,jx92k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b73at/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/relationships/node/,b73at,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a35eff61e3f47001086858c/,5a35eff61e3f47001086858c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jx92k/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jx92k

Therefore, the higher the rate of immigrant replenishment, the more likely respondents will speak Spanish at home. I analyze a five-year cumulative data file of the US American Community Survey (ACS) from 2011 to 2015, which represents 5 percent of the US population. The ACS uses stratified cluster sampling to collect data from 15,637,457 respondents. The sample is limited to US-born Mexican descendants, who were 25 years of age, married, and heads of households or spouses thereof. This limited the analysis to 187,212 respondents. I found that college attendance and higher family income decrease the odds of speaking Spanish at home. I also found that as immigrant replenishment increases, the odds of respondents speaking Spanish at home increases and decreases. As immigrant replenishment increases, respondents with Hispanic spouses are more likely to speak Spanish at home. However, respondents with non-Hispanic spouses are less likely to speak Spanish at home, which may be a result of sharpened intragroup boundaries created by new immigrants. The results confirm that Mexican immigrant replenishment significantly affects speaking Spanish at home for adult US-born Mexican descendants.",TRUE,FALSE,assimilation|ethnicity|immigrant replenishment|immigration|language|later generation|Mexican|Mexican descendants|Mexican immigrants|second generation|Spanish,2018-07-02T11:29:50.962014,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-17T15:10:49.675655,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/citation/,qnmuz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/esbx7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/relationships/node/,esbx7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a35b8ecbd7829001066b573/,5a35b8ecbd7829001066b573,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnmuz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qnmuz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qnmuz

The study adopted a quasi-experimental design. A sample of 184 students from four purposively selected secondary schools out of a population of 2,381 SS II students from Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State, Nigeria was used for the study. The experimental group was taught organic chemistry using hands-on activity-based method while the control group was taught using discussion method. Two research questions and two hypotheses guided the study. A validated 25-item Organic Chemistry Interest Inventory (OCII) was the instrument used to collect data. Reliability coefficients of 0.84 were established using Cronbach Alpha. Mean and Standard Deviation scores were used to answer the research questions while Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The results indicated that students taught using hands-on activity-based had significantly higher mean interest scores than those taught using discussion method (F=387.370, P(0.0001&lt;0.05). Male and female students in hands-on activity-based group did not differ significantly in mean interest scores (F= 117.523, P(0.101&gt;0.05).
