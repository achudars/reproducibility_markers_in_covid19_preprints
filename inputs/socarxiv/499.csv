But studies of this at the individual level are rare, examine only a handful of issues, and arrive at mixed results. We provide an extensive assessment of issue accountability at the individual level. We trace the congressional rollcall votes on 44 bills across seven Congresses (2006-2018), and link them to constituent's perceptions of their representative's votes and their evaluation of their representative.  Correlational, instrumental variables, and experimental approaches all show that constituents hold representatives accountable. A one-standard deviation increase in a constituent's perceived issue agreement with their representative can improve net approval by 35 percentage points.  Congressional districts, however, are heterogeneous. Consequently, the effect of issue agreement on vote is much smaller at the district-level, resolving an apparent discrepancy between micro and macro studies.",TRUE,FALSE,Accountability|American Politics|CCES|Political Behavior,2019-01-12T15:11:47.566510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T15:11:31.021737,NA,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QOVWMM,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/citation/,zuskq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c399faf8047080019f9b7a8/,5c399faf8047080019f9b7a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuskq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zuskq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zuskq,NA

Digital involvement may be particularly valuable in exploring methods to plan at a megaregional scale. Research is beginning to address digital inequalities, recognizing that broadband and smartphone access may restrict opportunities for disadvantaged groups. However, the geography and equity of participation remain pragmatic issues for practice and research. This paper reviews the geography and equity of the participation methods in Austin, Texas for active transportation (bicycling and pedestrian) through three approaches to co-produce informed plans: in-person meetings, public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), and an emerging smartphone platform that logs trips and encourages input on route quality. In addition to spatial analysis with standard deviational ellipses, we include qualitative case analysis to contextualize the geographic and equity implications of different participation approaches. Results show that both online techniques resulted in a larger geography for participation than in-person meetings, with the regional PPGIS covering the most area. However, review of the income levels in each area shows that use of the smartphone-based crowdsourcing platform was aligned with lowest-income areas. This study shows that online participation methods are not homogeneous regarding geography or equity. In some contexts, smartphone applications can help reach lower-income communities, even when compared with in-person meetings. Crowdsourcing tools can be valuable approaches to increase geography and equity of public participation in transportation planning.",TRUE,FALSE,bicycling|crowdsourcing|equity|GIS|megaregion|public participation,2019-01-12T15:10:26.982152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T15:10:12.560572,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/citation/,9ghrn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c398bf48047080018fceb7a/,5c398bf48047080018fceb7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ghrn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ghrn,https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198118823498

To explore this question, I study the relationship between income and happiness and I analyze the effect religiosity has on this relationship. I propose that income will have a bigger impact on the happiness of those who are non- or less religious compared to those who are very religious. The very religious believe that tough times are tests and they believe that God will, in due season, bless them too. This helps them stay happy and hopeful, even if they are not living in the best conditions. I use the General Social Survey, face-to-face interviews with adults (18 years and older) living in U.S. households, of 2016. I analyze the responses of 1,569 respondents. Consistent with existing research, income is significantly and positively correlated with happiness.

A multi-scalar analysis of distributional justice and wind energy in the United States,"The transition towards renewable energy is likely to be uneven across social and spatial dimensions. To ensure this transition is equitable and just, energy injustice has become the key framework for analyzing and interpreting the distribution of energy infrastructure. Wind energy development has experienced a significant gap between broad public support for increased development but persistent localized opposition to proposed projects, indicating that wind represents a locally unwanted land use. We argue that although the negative impacts of wind energy infrastructure are less extreme than those posed by other, more toxic, unwanted land uses, their status as a locally unwanted land use will produce similar distributional injustices as have been found throughout the environmental injustice literature. Using data from both the American Community Survey and the U.S. Wind Turbine Database, we use logistic and Poisson regressions, fixed effects, and temporal lags to evaluate the current landscape of wind energy injustice along the social dimensions of income, race and ethnicity, age, education, labor force participation, and rurality at three spatial scales: between all counties within the contiguous United States, between counties within states with wind energy, and between census tracts within counties with wind energy. We find results vary by scale and whether the model is comparing the presence of any development or the size of that development. The most evidence of injustice is visible at the within-county level related to whether or not there is any wind energy development, with few relationships present when evaluating the absolute size of development.",TRUE,FALSE,Energy justice|Environmental justice|Multilevel model|Renewable energy|United States|Wind energy|Wind farms,2019-01-11T15:15:27.822983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-11T15:14:57.809869,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/citation/,enbd4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c38ad95e8da0e001854f04e/,5c38ad95e8da0e001854f04e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enbd4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/enbd4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/enbd4,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.101406

have these benefits stopped if they fail to comply with certain conditions. Such a
stoppage is known as a â€˜benefit sanctionâ€™. The present working paper has two aims: i)
to provide an introduction to British system of sanctions, specifically as it applies to
unemployed people who are not disabled, and ii) to identify demographic inequalities
in the application of sanctions. Using data published by the UK Department of Work
and Pensions, we find that some groups of unemployed claimants (younger people,
men, and ethnic minorities) are at substantially higher risk of experiencing a sanction.
This working paper will be updated at a later date with analyses investigating the
drivers of this inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,conditionality|inequality|sanctions|welfare,2020-05-28T18:46:21.965406,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-28T18:45:57.763466,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Robert de Vries|Aaron Reeves and Ben Geiger,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/citation/,exn68,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3719888047080018fa9ced/,5c3719888047080018fa9ced,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exn68/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exn68/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exn68,NA
