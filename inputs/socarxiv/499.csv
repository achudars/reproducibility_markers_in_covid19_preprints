The impact of weather on stop and frisk,"The study of discretionary police activity has largely focused on the demographic characteristics (particularly ethnicity) of the parties involved. This study proposes a police action model that facilitates a more-holistic analysis of individual and situational influences on police actions. This model is used to generate hypotheses about the relationship between police stop and search/frisk and weather (temperature and precipitation) in London and New York City. After controlling for other situational factors (such as public holidays and special events) and for the frequency of street crime, increasing temperatures are associated with small increases in police stops, while precipitation (rain and snow) is associated with substantial decreases. These relationships disappear, however, when stops conducted indoors (e.g. in shopping malls) are modeled.

Incorporating theories connecting ethnic boundaries, prejudice, and perceived threat with a tendency to justify harsher penalties, bias, or excessive force against racial minorities, we examine how Christian nationalist ideology shapes Americans’ views about police treatment of black Americans. Analyses of 2017 data from a national probability sample show that adherence to Christian nationalism predicts that Americans will be more likely to believe that police treat blacks the same as whites and that police shoot blacks more often because blacks are more violent than whites. These effects are robust even when including controls for respondents’ religious and political characteristics, indicating that Christian nationalism influences Americans’ attitudes over and above the independent influences of political conservatism or religious parochialism. In fact, we find that religiosity influences policing attitudes in the opposite direction. Moreover, observed patterns do not differ by race, suggesting that Christian nationalism provides a cultural framework that can bolster anti-black prejudice among people of color as well as whites. We argue that Christian nationalism solidifies ethnic boundaries around national identity such that Americans are less willing to acknowledge police discrimination and more likely to victim-blame, even appealing to more overtly racist notions of blacks’ purportedly violent tendencies to justify police shootings.

Beyond being an attribute of individual women, education is also an aggregate phenomenon: the social meaning of a woman’s educational attainment depends on the educational attainments of her agemates. Using data from 30 countries and 246 birth cohorts across sub-Saharan Africa, we investigate the impact of educational context (the percent of women in a country cohort who ever attended school) on the relationship between a woman’s own educational attainment and her marital timing. In contexts where access to education is prevalent, the marital timing of uneducated and highly-educated women is more similar than it is in contexts where attending school is limited to a privileged minority. This across-country convergence is driven by no-education women marrying later in high-education contexts, especially through lower rates of very early marriages. However, within countries over time, the marital ages of women from different educational groups tend to diverge as educational access expands. This within-country divergence is most often driven by later marriage among highly-educated women, although some countries’ divergence is driven by earlier marriage among women who never attended school.",TRUE,FALSE,africa|education|marriage,2018-07-04T16:29:44.709607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T16:28:59.682101,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/citation/,78fra,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p5dsx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/relationships/node/,p5dsx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3c7d4a166089000d6aea09/,5b3c7d4a166089000d6aea09,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78fra/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/78fra/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/78fra,NA

Aiming to go beyond its limitations and challenges, vTaiwan iterates on creating a feasible model of decentralized consultation for society.",TRUE,FALSE,Civic Participation|Deliberative Democracy|Human-centered Computing|Participatory Design|Policy-making Procedure,2018-07-04T16:29:04.850213,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T16:28:41.516645,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c67|Law|Legislation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/citation/,xyhft,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jnq8u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/relationships/node/,jnq8u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3c5c85987be0001299ec93/,5b3c5c85987be0001299ec93,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyhft/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xyhft/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xyhft,NA

This question is particularly salient in developing countries, where more of the world’s population growth is occurring and where urbanization trends are the fastest. This study revisits the issue of the driving mechanism for urban growth, aiming to assess the relative contribution of natural increase and rural to urban migration. This issue has been considered in two prior publications of the United Nations. The first provided both a broader discussion of urban and rural population growth more generally, as well as a presentation of the method for studying the components of urban growth using the Census Survival Ratio Method (United Nations 1980). The second report continued the analysis on the components to urban growth with the same basic methodology and using updated data from a larger number of countries (United Nations 2001). The current study greatly expands the empirical range by including data on 248 censuses from 76 countries. We focus attention on certain specific assumptions underlying the methodology. In particular, we examine the methodological limitations to help to understand the extent to which the overall assessment of the components of growth may (or may not) be affected by these assumptions. These additional analyses provide further insight into the sensitivity of estimates of the components of urban growth.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|developing countries|Migration|natural increase|Urban,2018-07-04T01:14:01.672017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T01:13:40.875406,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Guy Stecklov,2008,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/citation/,4zk5b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6e9hx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/relationships/node/,6e9hx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3c1286166089000d6aa7f9/,5b3c1286166089000d6aa7f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4zk5b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4zk5b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4zk5b,NA

However, a form of information seems still underestimated, perhaps precisely because it is so pervasive that we take it for granted: the information encoded in the very environment we live in. We still do not fully understand how information takes the form of cities, and how our minds deal with it in order to learn about the world, make daily decisions, and take part in the complex system of interactions we create as we live together. This paper addresses three related problems that need to be solved if we are to understand the role of environmental information: (1) the physical problem: how can we preserve information in the built environment? (2) The semantic problem: how do we make environmental information meaningful? and (3) the pragmatic problem: how do we use environmental information in our daily lives? Attempting to devise a solution to these problems, we introduce a three-layered model of information in cities, namely environmental information in physical space, environmental information in semantic space, and the information enacted by interacting agents. We propose forms of estimating entropy in these different layers, and apply these measures to emblematic urban cases and simulated scenarios. Our results suggest that ordered spatial structures and diverse land use patterns encode information, and that aspects of physical and semantic information affect coordination in interaction systems.",TRUE,FALSE,cities|entropy|environment|information|interaction|social action,2018-07-04T16:27:46.033439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T16:27:01.356535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/citation/,jgz5d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gcfxb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/relationships/node/,gcfxb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3a832200a08e000cd5edff/,5b3a832200a08e000cd5edff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jgz5d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jgz5d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jgz5d,NA
