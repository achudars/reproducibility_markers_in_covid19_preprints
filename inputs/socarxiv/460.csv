The UK in a Changing Europe.","On 24 June 2016, many people had the feeling that they had gone to bed the night before in the United Kingdom and had woken up in Little Britain – a country prone to isolationism and protectionism, risking hurting its economic and social development for the sake of imperial nostalgia and moral panic about ‘loss of sovereignty’ and ‘mass migration’. That feeling inevitably affected many individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, queer and other (LGBTIQ+). Although the possible impact of Brexit seems to have been scrutinised from most angles, there has been limited analysis of how it may affect LGBTIQ+ individuals.

There is certainly more than one ‘gay in the village’, so it is worth assessing Brexit in relation to the situation of LGBTIQ+ individuals.

British Politics and Policy LSE blog, London.","Judged by the level of political debate, public policy and academic literature, the work of children (under-18s) in England and Wales is neither of interest nor of concern. And yet the absence of this topic from the policy agenda is far from indicative of its lack of relevance or timeliness. In fact, figures from the Labour Force Survey suggest that about a third of young people aged 16-17 are active in the labour market. Many of these young people, and others even younger, work illegally for a range of reasons: because of the number of hours worked, their age, the type of work carried out, the time of day worked, or because they lack a work permit. 
Indeed, in 2013, Nils Muižnieks – the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights – reported on children working long hours in the UK as a consequence of the late 2000s economic crisis. And in 2015, at a seminar held in Liverpool, several children of high school age spoke candidly about practices of dubious legality that they experienced at work, including low pay, informal work arrangements, deficient health and safety conditions, and sexist recruitment procedures, not to speak of detrimental effects to their education. More generally, we should be alarmed that children who work mainly carry out unskilled and manual labour, are poorly paid, acquire limited recognisable skills, jeopardise their educational attainment, sustain accidental injuries (in particular in delivery and agricultural work), may not be covered by insurance and accident cover, are often burdened with caring duties, and may even be recruited by the military.

Using Future Treatments to Detect and Reduce Hidden Bias,"Conventional advice discourages controlling for post-outcome variables in regression analysis. Here, we show that controlling for commonly available post-outcome (i.e. future) values of the treatment variable can help detect, reduce, and even remove omitted variable bias (unobserved confounding). The premise is that the same unobserved confounders that affect treatment also affect future values of the treatment. Future treatments thus proxy for the unmeasured confounder, and researchers can exploit these proxy measures productively. We establish several new results: Regarding a commonly assumed data-generating process involving future treatments, we (1) introduce a simple new approach to reduce bias and show that it strictly reduces bias; (2) elaborate on existing approaches and show that they can increase bias; (3) assess the relative merits of approaches; (4) analyze true state dependence and selection as key challenges; and (5) demonstrate that future treatments can test for hidden bias, even when they fail to reduce bias.

Although Directive 2004/28 (the Citizenship Directive) has enhanced the system of protection afforded to offending European Union citizens, it still contains a number of cracks that lead to policy incoherence and gaps in rights protection. This is evident in the first rulings on Article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38 concerning the deportation of offending EU citizens. These issues also threaten to transform European Union citizenship from a fundamental status into a thin overlay that, under pressure from national executive power, loses its effect and significance. To be sure, EU citizenship has demonstrated that community belonging does not have to be based on organic-national qualities, cultural commonalities, or individuals' conformity to national values, but the continued deportation of long-term resident Union citizens makes nationality the ultimate determinant of belonging.

In: Liability in the third millennium : liber amicorum Gert Brüggemeier. Nomos, pp. 49-84","There is an increasing effect of fundamental rights outside of the citizen-state relationship, invading domains such as labour law, contract law, family law, and property law. These rights and principles have often served as much more than mere interpretive aids and have become actual substantive rules of law, independent of whether their invocation resulted in a successful or unsuccessful claim. This debate, commonly referred to as the horizontal effect of fundamental rights, has also undoubtedly affected the law of torts. The development of the debate surrounding the horizontal effect of fundamental rights and the readiness of several courts to permit basic rights to influence the outcome of a case, have led to an increasingly decisive role for constitutional texts in the field of torts. 
The effect of fundamental rights in the field of the law of torts is undoubtedly more often felt in regard to the position of the tort victim, and the entitlement of the victim to damages, rather than in regard to the position of the tortfeasor strictu sensu. By this it is implied that, despite judges sometimes balancing the fundamental rights of both tort victims and tortfeasors, the influence of fundamental rights in the law of torts impacts, most often, directly the position of tort victims, either by strengthening or weakening their position, always concentrating more intensively on their interests. The position of tortfeasors is commonly only affected indirectly, as a consequence of the consideration of the fundamental rights of tort victims. This can be easily illustrated by references to the English, German and Italian jurisdictions, among others.
By drawing from scholarly writings and case-law from several European and non-European jurisdictions, this book chapter contributes to a change from the focus on the position of the tort victim to that of the tortfeasor. In order for the law of torts to fulfil and satisfy all its different functions and interests, while simultaneously respecting and promoting commonly accepted legal values, the position of the tortfeasor should be analysed in se, not as a mere reflection of the position of the tort victim. No other instrument could perform this task better than fundamental rights, dynamic tools that they are. In addition, the thorough fulfilment of all fundamental rights equally requires such change in the legal mindset, as the law of torts has to give respect to the fundamental rights of both the tort victim and the tortfeasor in a balanced and just way. A refocus of the debate surrounding the horizontal effect of fundamental rights on the law of torts is therefore proposed, thus also assessing the impact that fundamental rights and principles may have directly on the position of the tortfeasor strictu sensu.",TRUE,FALSE,|comparative law|constitutional law|fundamental rights|human rights|tortfesors|tort law|tort victims,2018-10-16T21:56:43.528480,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T21:56:33.231561,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts,Nuno Ferreira,2009,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/citation/,96zpj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xds2n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/relationships/node/,xds2n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5eb1453cec4001badeb52/,5bc5eb1453cec4001badeb52,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96zpj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/96zpj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/96zpj,https://doi.org/10.5771/9783845213859-49

The analysis will be framed within the context of the global debates about child labour, and will highlight the role that the EU might play in those debates. The chapter starts by sketching the main lines of the ‘child labour’ debate, the qualitative and quantitative significance of children in the EU labour market, and the relevant EU competences. It will then touch upon a range of EU labour law instruments that affect children, both as direct addressees – especially the Young Workers Directive – and collateral beneficiaries, including a variety of tools that address sex discrimination. Finally, the chapter will assess the compatibility between the instruments and policies considered and, amongst others, the CRC, the relevant ILO instruments, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The conclusion will determine the scope for improvement of the current state of affairs, and present policy recommendations.",TRUE,FALSE,child labour|children's rights|child work|employment law|European law|labour law|social rights|Young Workers Directive,2018-10-16T17:44:45.164170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:43:59.961074,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/citation/,b8fkv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7gkpw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/relationships/node/,7gkpw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5d8b653cec4001badc8b7/,5bc5d8b653cec4001badc8b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8fkv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8fkv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8fkv,https://doi.org/10.3224/978384740193d

An introduction,"The EU has throughout its history benefited from variable levels of popular support and revealed different levels of capacity to deal with crises. The current circumstances, on account of financial pressures, social instability and present geographical and policy scope of the EU, require serious introspection and ‘soul searching’. What can be done if the EU is not to perish and, hopefully, become more part of the solution than of the problem? May becoming more humane be the answer?
‘Humane’ may be defined in different ways, including compassionate, sympathetic and humanitarian. Non-Western cultures seem to have made a much more sophisticated use of this notion in broader contexts up to the present day. Chinese culture, through the Confucian notion of ‘jen’, places enormous value on humaneness as a way of achieving balance, empathy and the moral standard. In the African context, the notion of ‘ubuntu’ has served as the gateway through which humaneness infiltrates all aspects of society, including law and policy, namely by focussing on participation, co-responsibility, interdependence, respect and equality. 
This introduction presents an analytical framework through which the degree of humaneness of the different fields of EU law and policy can be assessed.",TRUE,FALSE,|ethic of care|European Union|humane|humaneness|humanity|human rights|jen|rights|ubuntu,2018-10-16T17:44:05.395876,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:43:32.179853,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0f|Law|Public Law and Legal Theory|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c58|Law|Law and Philosophy|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/citation/,2mdrw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7f8ur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/relationships/node/,7f8ur,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5d74d53cec4001aad1468/,5bc5d74d53cec4001aad1468,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mdrw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2mdrw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2mdrw,NA

This was, however, accompanied by other discriminatory practices and forms of hostility, exclusion and violence against the Roma, such as finger-printing in Italy and educational segregation in the Czech Republic. A comprehensive approach and strong action by the EU against these practices was defended, which led to the Commission communication on the EU Framework on National Roma Integration Strategies (2011), a non-binding Parliament resolution (2013) and the Council recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the member states (2013). Such comprehensive approach may be in many respects appropriate, but the danger is to neglect the true relevance of concrete, enforceable and ‘hard law’ measures. This chapter thus explores the legal adequacy of EU action with regard to the Roma minority, particularly from free movement and EU citizenship perspectives. The scope for derogations from free movement and from the rights associated with EU citizenship are the centre pieces of this analysis, which critically analyses specific EU Member States’ restrictions on the free movement of the Roma minority and the EU response in this and other relevant aspects.",TRUE,FALSE,|derogations|EU citizenship|European Union|expulsion|free movement|integration|minorities|political participation|Roma,2018-10-16T17:42:01.208457,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:41:23.783282,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5e|Law|Law and Race|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira and Dora Kostakopoulou,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/citation/,da9rw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/67mnu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/relationships/node/,67mnu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5d27d53cec4001aad1059/,5bc5d27d53cec4001aad1059,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da9rw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/da9rw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/da9rw,NA
