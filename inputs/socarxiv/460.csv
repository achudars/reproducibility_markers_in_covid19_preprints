Therefore, it represents a unique skill consists of a mixture of several procedures that encourage the interaction with printed words for content and pleasure. The current study tries to  identify the impact of pleasure reading on enhancing writing achievement and reading comprehension. The study has employed different data collection methods, such as published research, articles, books, theses, and dissertations that are related to the study matter to provide answers to the following question: ‘ Do pleasure reading have an impact on enhancing writing achievement and reading comprehension?’. The results reveal that; pleasure reading has a positive impact on enhancing writing achievement and reading comprehension. In addition to, pleasure reading provides readers with entertainment, relaxation, comfort, as it also offers them a creative outlet and  means of escape, which, in turn, affect positively  effect on the writing performance. Moreover,  reading helps learners develop their writing experience by inspiring them, expanding their vocabulary, and improving their grammatical structure.

Moreover, it tests the pedagogy of adopting the strategy of Digital Story Telling (DST) in teaching English as a foreign language. The study is applied on Northern Boarder University as a case study. The first question raised in this study is whether the conventional methods of teaching are the reason behind their failure of speaking the English language and whether the modification in the pedagogy of teaching affects the learners' speaking skill. To this end, data are collected through a questionnaire.  Furthermore, a model of a teaching program, based on using DST strategy, is improved and tested with a group of learners at the chosen university in Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that the learners at the selected university find difficulty in speaking English, and that applying DST as a pedagogy help the students to develop their overall speaking skill. These findings assist EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia in creating a conducive atmosphere in and out their classes, which will motivate the learners a lot to speak English fluently.

They can also recreate their own identities in the course of their interaction. This study investigates ways in which the identities of speakers can be revealed by their use of language in multiple-participant conversations. In particular, the study aims to elicit the strategies that speakers employ the most by analysing the way they talk at a micro-analytic level, and the ways in which they organise and sequence their turns at talking. The results show that the processes of turn-taking and topic development are subject to distraction and breakdown in computer-mediated environments. There are many instances of pauses caused by frequent overlaps between participants. The accents of participants are considered the main feature which can constitute one’s identity in voice-based chat-rooms. Other factors such as communication and technical skills, systems and server speeds could also have an effect on such communication. Additionally, the participants seem to employ certain strategies to overcome interactional limitations of CMC systems, such as the use of pauses, quiet and loud intonation, and stress of particular syllables of some words.

Students’ success in today’s learning lies on their ability to utilize technology as the heart of globalizationas well as to communicate in English effectively within a variety of purposes.  Project-based learning, as one of the technology-based activities, is believed to be an effective method to facilitate the use of technology and oral communication skill in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. This article investigates whether there is a significant difference in students’ speaking ability between students taught through PBL using e-poster and those taught through conventional method. It also determines whether there is a significant difference in students speaking ability between extrovert and introvert students taught through PBL using e-poster. Sixty-one Indonesian secondary level students from two intact classes were involved and assigned randomly into experimental and control groups.

There are various factors that cause language anxiety, the most common of which include learners’ excessive self-consciousness and self-awareness concerning their oral reproduction and performance and their peculiar, and quite often misplaced and mistaken, views and beliefs regarding different approaches. Other potential reasons for this problem could include the fear, and the consequent deterrence occasioned thereof, of encountering difficulties in language learning, specifically learners’ individual problems regarding the culture of the target language and the varying social statuses of speakers. The most important fear is, perhaps, the deterrent fear of causing damage to one’s self-identity. Therefore, while needing to paying special attention to language learners’ anxiety reactions, language teachers have a crucial role in helping their students achieve the expected performance goals in the target language. Another factor that could potentially lead to language anxiety is simply the poor command of the target language. This problem could be attributed to linguistic barriers and obstacles language learners encounter in learning and using the target language. In the current study, using a qualitative, semi-structured interview and the focus-group discussion technique, the researcher aims to investigate the factors that contribute to language anxiety among Arab language learners. It focuses on learners both within the classroom setting and without, i.e. in the social context, and recommends a number of approaches to manage and overcome this problem.",TRUE,FALSE,anxiety reaction|classroom anxiety|language anxiety|language learners|situation-specific anxiety,2019-07-20T21:31:03.922377,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:30:35.739515,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/citation/,nk4em,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa4477641d100019bf6f19/,5caa4477641d100019bf6f19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nk4em/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nk4em

Due to the complicatedness of this skill, many teachers find it difficult to make their learners aware of the divergent phases of writing so they produce better compositions. Thus, the professionalism of teachers is inevitably essential in shaping the learners’ writing ability (assisting students as they develop a piece of writing, and boosting their engagement with writing), and learners can achieve successful learning outcomes if they grasp how best to improve their work. To make language learning more effective, there is a need for pursuing professional growth and providing conditions where teachers cooperate to attain higher levels of learning among their students. Indeed, professional development for a teacher is about acquiring new skills, creating a potent learning atmosphere, surmounting the barriers, rectifying the failures and moving forward. It provides ongoing opportunities for educators to continue to identify teaching/learning problems, develop solutions, raise their performance, address students’ needs and up their achievements. The present paper sets out to take a closer look at how teachers work with writing among the first year English as foreign language (EFL) students. It tends to offer an instruction based on a set of professional development methods that provide practitioners with several avenues to implement them in classroom practice. To this end, findings of the research indicate that the proposed strategies can lead to a virtuous bond between the teaching/learning process of written expression that may generate beneficial knowledge, valuable teaching, and constructive learning results.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL students|professional development|writing|written expression,2019-07-20T21:30:43.935495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:30:15.647020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/citation/,5yhgj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa43b1df977b0019f42787/,5caa43b1df977b0019f42787,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5yhgj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5yhgj
