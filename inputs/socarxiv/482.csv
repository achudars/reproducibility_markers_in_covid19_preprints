Some contend that increasing aridity exacerbated conflict, while others have found that increasing temperature ramped up conflict. Here, we report a study in which we sought to resolve this disagreement. We collated annually-resolved conflict and climate data, and then created a Bayesian time-series model for analysing count-based prehistoric and historic data. We carried out three analyses, one covering more or less the whole of the Classic Period (292-900 CE), one focused on the Early Classic (292-600 CE), and one that concentrated on the Late Classic (600-900 CE). Our analyses indicated that climate change likely did impact Classic Maya conflict levels, but our results differed from those of previous studies in two important ways. First, we found that the impact of climate change is only evident during the Late Classic. Second, we found that while increasing summer temperature exacerbated conflict, increasing aridity suppressed it. Thus, our study offers a new, more complex perspective on Classic Maya climate-conflict dynamics. It also has implications for our understanding of other aspects of Classic Maya history and for the debate about the likely impact of the current bout of climate change on conflict levels.",TRUE,FALSE,aridity|Bayesian time-series analysis|Classic Maya|Climate Change|conflict|human-environment interaction|temperature,2019-02-20T13:20:27.975648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T13:04:35.760749,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,William Christopher Carleton|Dave Campbell|Mark Collard,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/citation/,ntv8y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3zq9j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/relationships/node/,3zq9j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6c68628d5d98001a3039f5/,5c6c68628d5d98001a3039f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntv8y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ntv8y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ntv8y,NA

In this study, we analyze data from a survey experiment designed to assess public opinion about a range of workplace diversity policies. We examine how support for these policies among employed respondents varies by race, gender, and by the targeted population (i.e. whether the policies aim to improve the workplace representation of women or racial minorities). Using OLS regression models to analyze a diverse sample of employed persons participating in the survey, we find that women, blacks, and Latina/os are more supportive of diversity policies than men and whites, and a substantial portion of these gender/race differences can be explained by group-differences in the belief that discrimination causes inequality. In addition, we find that respondents report lower levels of support for workplace policies when these policies are framed as a mechanism to increase diversity than when they are framed as being needed to address discrimination or if no justification is given for the policy. Our findings highlight the role of inequality beliefs in shaping worker support for diversity policies, suggesting directions for  future research on how such beliefs are developed.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|inequality|public opinoin|race|Workplace diversity policies,2019-02-20T13:24:07.555977,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T13:07:39.861513,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",William Scarborough,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/citation/,yfznx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4cus3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/relationships/node/,4cus3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6c469f62c82a0017d63685/,5c6c469f62c82a0017d63685,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfznx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yfznx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yfznx,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2019.01.002

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992 (UNFCCC) established a foundation for the development, application and diffusion of low-carbon technologies. Against this background, it is useful to analyse how the Paris Agreement 2015 deals with the subject of intellectual property, technology transfer, and climate change. While there was discussion of a number of options for intellectual property and climate change, the final Paris Agreement 2015 contains no text on intellectual property. There is text, though, on technology transfer. The Paris Agreement 2015 relies upon technology networks and alliances in order to promote the diffusion and dissemination of green technologies. In order to achieve technology transfer, there has been an effort to rely on a number of formal technology networks, alliances, and public–private partnerships—including the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN); the World Intellectual Property Organization’s WIPO GREEN; Mission Innovation; the Breakthrough Energy Coalition; and the International Solar Alliance. There have been grand hopes and ambitions in respect of these collaborative and co-operative ventures. However, there have also been significant challenges in terms of funding, support, and operation. In a case of innovation policy pluralism, there also seems to be a significant level of overlap and duplication between the diverse international initiatives. There have been concerns about whether such technology networks are effective, efficient, adaptable, and accountable. There is a need to better align intellectual property, innovation policy, and technology transfer in order to achieve access to clean energy and climate justice under the framework of the Paris Agreement 2015. At a conceptual level, philosophical discussions about climate justice should be grounded in pragmatic considerations about intellectual property and technology transfer. An intellectual property mechanism is necessary to provide for research, development, and deployment of clean technologies. There is a need to ensure that the technology mechanism of the Paris Agreement 2015 can enable the research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies at a scale to address the global challenges of climate change.",TRUE,FALSE,climate finance|climate justice|climate law|innovation law|innovation policy|Intellectual Property|SOCARXIV,2019-02-19T11:54:08.338783,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-19T11:53:24.508303,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c29|Law|International Trade Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/citation/,fxhvm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6b71078d5d98001b2e6865/,5c6b71078d5d98001b2e6865,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxhvm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxhvm,https://doi.org/10.3390/laws8010007

We analyze a game-theoretic model that shows how the threat of corruption affects the incentives of non-corrupt politicians to enlist the help of lobbyists to make more informed decisions. Politicians face a dilemma because voters cannot always tell whether a politician allows access to lobbyists in order to solicit corruption or to seek information. Thus, a non-corrupt politician may deny access to lobbyists to signal that she is non-corrupt even though doing so impedes her ability to make good policy. This signaling may decrease the welfare of the voters depending on the value of the lost policy information relative to the value of screening out corrupt politicians.",TRUE,FALSE,Campaigns|Lobbying|Signaling,2019-02-19T11:54:07.175294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-19T11:53:43.737097,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,Keith E.

Objectives: The article describes the results of author’s own research into selected aspects of sexual health of women with intellectual disability (ID). The focus has been on issues such as menstruation, health and gynecological care, pharmacologization, contraception, STDs, and menopause.

Methods: The research was conducted with 11 women using structured interviews.

Results: Results suggest that these women have a low level of competencies to manage and control health problems in an optimal way. Their behavior is determined by people from their living environment to a large extent. Women with ID report various abnormalities in the course of developmental phenomena and in their own health, indicating potentially serious diseases and disorders.

Both tools are sometimes used concurrently but the relation between children’s scores on the two tools is seldom investigated.

Methods: The Brazilian versions of ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE, known as the ASQ-BR and ASQ:SE-BR, were used for assessing 13,470 children ages one to four in public child daycare centres in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Four groups were defined according to children’s ages as one, two, three, and four year-olds. Correlation and multiple regression were employed to explore the relation between children’s scores on the ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SE-BR.

Results: Results indicated that the domain scores of ASQ-BR, including communication (r = -0.38 to -0.44), gross motor (r = -0.19 to -0.32), fine motor (r = -0.33 to -0.45), problem solving (r = -0.36 to -0.42), and personal-social (r = -0.38 to -0.51) were significantly correlated with ASQ:SE-BR scores. Regression analyses suggested that the communication and personal-social domains were significant predictors of social-emotional scores in most of the age groups.

Conclusion: General developmental assessment is suggested to be conducted with social-emotional screening.

The difference to the classical optimal taxation literature is that I introduce a behavioral twist according to which people’s aspirations change from one period to another as suggested by empirical evidence. It turns out that the policy implication from this model can differ significantly from the one assuming full rationality. In the behavioral model, a lump-sum tax is much less attractive. This paper does not aim at providing a full-fledged quantitative model, it should rather be seen as a cautionary tale about the robustness of classical optimal taxation results when deviating from full rationality.",TRUE,FALSE,Apirations|Behavioral optimal taxation|Behavioral public finance|Easterlin Paradox,2019-02-18T17:31:01.898909,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-18T17:29:47.330591,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,Matthias Weber,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/citation/,fpnw6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6a986d1431270016a0c3f5/,5c6a986d1431270016a0c3f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpnw6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fpnw6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fpnw6,NA

For this, organizational leaders need to assess baseline conditions, identify areas needing improvement, and to judge the impact of specific initiatives to sustain or improve translational research practices at their institutions. Currently, there is a lack of such an assessment tool addressing the specific context of translational biomedical research. To close this gap, we have developed and tested a new survey for assessing the organizational climate for translational research. This self-assessment tool measures employees’ perceptions of translational climate and underlying research practices in organizational environments and builds on the established Survey of Organizational Research Climate. Having implemented the new survey in practice, we show that scientists at a large university hospital (Charité Berlin) perceive translation as a central and important component of their work. Importantly, local resources and direct support are main contributing factors for the practical implementation of translation into their own research practice. We identify and discuss potential leverage points for an improvement of research climate to foster successful translational research.",TRUE,FALSE,anonymous survey|institutional self-assessment|organizational climate|survey tool|Translational research,2019-02-19T11:53:30.556242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-19T11:52:36.621205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/citation/,mjg7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6a8d72f9de85001931115f/,5c6a8d72f9de85001931115f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mjg7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mjg7t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mjg7t,NA

The intervention includes arousal-regulation, multiple sensory processing, conceptualization, affective mentalization and associative memory formation (active learning). Autism Spectrum Disorder is a clinical diagnosis for a heterogeneous group of individuals who experience pervasive neurodevelopmental problems including perceiving the world in a fragmented way: the pre-conceptual state of mind. Tailored ReAttach sessions support individuals with ASD to develop a coherent sense of the self and the world.
Objective: The aim of this article is to describe how a to tailor a ReAttach session to the individual state of mind of individuals with ASD.
Method: ReAttach-C.A.T. is a Computer Adaptive Tool, built to assist therapists to map the individual state of mind before the start of ReAttach sessions. The instrument is in its early stage of development.
Results: A group of 52 patients with complex developmental challenges were interviewed by their ReAttach therapist, using the inclusive ReAttach-C.A.T. Mapping the individual state of mind in co-creation with the individual with ASD, makes sense and is helpful for a variety of reasons. It also sheds a new light on the Forms of Vitality of the co-creators.",TRUE,FALSE,Autism|Forms of Vitality|ReAttach,2019-02-18T17:26:11.358534,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-18T17:24:55.303194,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Child Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/citation/,896sd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/weh4d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/relationships/node/,weh4d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6a65941431270018a3f036/,5c6a65941431270018a3f036,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/896sd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/896sd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/896sd,https://doi.org/10.26407/2018jrtdd.1.14
