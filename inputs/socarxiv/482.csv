try to establish regularities, over space and time, in the complex
system that is the human phenomenon. Although vocabulary and tools
have changed, the questions that animate this research program bear
striking similarity to those pursued by nineteenth-century
intellectuals in a quest to establish universal laws shaping human
affairs. In fact, that very quest provided the impetus for the
emergence of what would later become distinct disciplines in the
social and historical sciences, including anthropology and sociology.

Why, then, is this interdisciplinary research program often met with
skepticism, or even outright resistance, within anthropology?

In this chapter I provide a brief outline of developments in the
history of anthropology leading to this state of affairs, in the hope
of alleviating misunderstanding between those who support the
interdisciplinary research program and those who oppose it. As a
practical contribution toward this end, I then provide an overview of
key established resources for systematic comparative approaches to the
archaeological record. I conclude by discussing challenges and
opportunities in this area at the interface with recent developments

Thus, risk for genetic disease represents a collective stressor shared by family members. According to communal coping theory, families may adapt to such risk vis-a-vis interpersonal exchange of support resources. We propose that communal coping is operationalized through the pattern of supportive relationships observed between family members. While past research has examined support exchange of family members who received genetic testing, the roles of family members who declined testing, or were not otherwise at risk for disease, have not been fully examined. In this study, we take a social network perspective to map communal coping mechanisms to their underlying social interactions and include those who declined testing or were not at risk for Lynch Syndrome. Specifically, we examine the exchange of emotional support resources in families at risk of Lynch Syndrome, a dominantly inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome. Our results show that emotional support resources depend on the testing-status of individual family members and are not limited to the bounds of the family.  Network members from within and outside the family system are an important coping resource in this patient population.

I argue for an analytic distinction between “doings” (practices, habits, routines), “sayings” (vocabularies), semiotic codes, rules of the game, and artifacts as the broad classes of objects that could be subject to institutionalization processes and can thus form the “building blocks” of institutions.

It provides a bridge between existing and divergent but related strings of research of particular systemic elements as a unifying macro-theory of our social and physical world, fusing multiple approaches into a common model. The unifying key is the focus on the behavior of agents (e.g., individuals; groups; cities; states; world systems) as it relates to the environment (both natural and social) in which these agents act and the feedback between behavior and environment. Evolutionary systems approaches can broadly be placed into two categories: (1) the biobehavioral and (2) the socialevolutionary approach to the study of international relations with the help of evolutionary theory. The point of evolutionary explanations is not to make the case that humans are incapable of making their own choices —far from it, learning and selection are critical elements of human agency in evolutionary models.

His work established deep associations linking food culture, and taste more generally, with social class and other aspects of identity, demonstrating the economic and social determinants of taste and their role in representing distinctions, differences between groups.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-15T22:54:41.290579,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-15T22:54:20.508208,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/citation/,j9tga,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/myhge/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/relationships/node/,myhge,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b74a52315f5c500150b2827/,5b74a52315f5c500150b2827,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9tga/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9tga/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9tga,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.007

According to this theory, individual income is the result of ‘human capital’. The idea is that human capital makes people more productive, which leads to higher income. But is this really the case? This paper takes a critical look at human capital theory and its explanation of personal income distribution. I find that human capital theory’s claims are dubious at best. In most cases, the theory is either not supported by evidence, is so vague that it is untestable, or is based on circular reasoning. In short, human capital theory is a barrier to the scientific study of income distribution.",TRUE,FALSE,critique|hierarchy|human capital theory|income distribution|power|productivity,2018-08-15T22:54:21.482546,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-15T22:54:08.732714,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/citation/,ax6k7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m9gpc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/relationships/node/,m9gpc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b74884815f5c500150b08e8/,5b74884815f5c500150b08e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax6k7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ax6k7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ax6k7,NA

In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%-38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage.",TRUE,FALSE,academic search engines|bibliographic databases|bibliometrics|citation analysis|citation overlap|coverage|Google Scholar|scientometrics|Scopus|unique citations|Web of Science,2018-08-15T12:14:44.404911,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-15T12:14:16.482547,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,© 2018 The authors,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/citation/,42nkm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vja89/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/relationships/node/,vja89,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b73ebe5b79df200190f6ab3/,5b73ebe5b79df200190f6ab3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42nkm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42nkm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42nkm,NA
