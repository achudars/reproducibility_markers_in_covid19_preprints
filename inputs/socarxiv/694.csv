twenty years have seen the rise of a new business model – the patent troll
– that grew to become a majority of all patent lawsuits. They have seen a
significant expansion in the number of patents granted and a fundamental
change in the industries in which those patents are filed. They have seen
the passage of the most important legislative reform in the last sixty
years, a law that reoriented legal challenges to patents away from courts
and toward the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). And they have seen
remarkable changes in nearly every important legal doctrine, from patent
eligibility to obviousness to infringement to remedies.

These changes have prompted alarm in a number of quarters. From the 1990s
to the 2000s, as the number of patents and patent troll suits skyrocketed,
technology companies and academics worried about the “crisis” in the patent
system – a crisis of overprotection that might interfere with rather than
promote innovation. By 2015, as patent reform took effect and the Supreme
Court undid many of the Federal Circuit’s expansions of patent rights, it
was patent owners who were speaking of a crisis in the patent system – a
crisis of underprotection that might leave innovators without adequate
protection. Depending on one’s perspective, then, the sky seems to have
been falling on the patent system for some time.

Despite the undeniable significance of these changes in both directions,
something curious has happened to the fundamental characteristics of the
patent ecosystem during this period: very little. Whether we look at the
number of patent applications filed, the number of patents issued, the
number of lawsuits filed, the patentee win rate in those lawsuits, or the
market for patent licenses, the data show very little evidence that patent
owners and challengers are behaving differently because of changes in the
law. The patent system, then, seems surprisingly resilient to changes in
the law. This is a puzzle. In this article, I document this phenomenon and
give some thought to why the fundamental characteristics of the patent
system seem resistant to even major changes in patent law and procedure.

reform but for the role of the patent system in society as a whole.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:47.451170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:49:39.851000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/citation/,pe3rh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w5uka/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/relationships/node/,w5uka,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c86a35b83f6901eacd7ee0/,57c86a35b83f6901eacd7ee0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pe3rh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pe3rh

district judges face in patent cases. Many have suggested greater district
court specialization as a solution, and Congress in 2011 enacted
legislation to promote such specialization. In this paper, we investigate
the impact of a novel measure of experience – whether a district court
judge has sat by designation on a Federal Circuit panel in a patent claim
construction appeal – on the likelihood a district judge’s subsequent claim
constructions are reversed. Before sitting by designation, judges who later
do so actually have a slightly higher claim construction reversal rate than
judges who never do so. After sitting by designation, the reversal rate of
district court judges on subsequent claim construction appeals decreases by
50 percent. This decrease is not fully explained by other measures of
experience, including the number of prior patent cases or years on the
bench. Nor is it fully explained by the timing of the appeal, the
particular district court judge or various other characteristics of the
patents, the parties and the litigation. Our results suggest a simple way
to reduce the reversal rate in patent and perhaps other sorts of cases.
However, our evidence suggests this increased agreement is due to increased
Federal Circuit trust in the decisions of individual judges who have sat by
designation and not increased district judge understanding of claim
construction.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:02.615696,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:42:54.155000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/citation/,y8c9z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wpuu3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/relationships/node/,wpuu3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c8689f594d9001e488f8aa/,57c8689f594d9001e488f8aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y8c9z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y8c9z

consumers to avoid arbitration clauses, even when businesses strategically
insert provisions in them that effectively prevent consumers from being
able to bring any claim in any forum. In American Express Co. v. Italian
Colors Restaurant, an antitrust case, the Court held that class-action
waivers embedded in mandatory arbitration clauses were enforceable even
when they had the effect of making it economically irrational for the
victims of antitrust violations to pursue their claims.

Courts have long considered antitrust claims to be too complex and too
important to trust to private arbitrators. By the 1980s, the Supreme Court
permitted federal statutory rights, including antitrust claims, to be
arbitrated so long as the plaintiffs could effectively vindicate their
rights in the alternative forum. In 2013, the Supreme Court in Italian
Colors fundamentally weakened the Effective Vindication Doctrine when it
held that arbitration clauses that precluded class actions and classwide
arbitration were enforceable even when they effectively prohibited all
individual plaintiffs from bringing a case.

Arbitration differs from litigation in ways that harm the interests of
consumer antitrust plaintiffs. For example, arbitration limits discovery
and has no meaningful appeals process. Furthermore, defendants use the
terms in arbitration clauses to prevent class actions and to undercut the
pro-plaintiff features of antitrust law, including mandatory treble
damages, meaningful injunctive relief, recovery of attorneys’ fees, and a
lengthy statute of limitations. With the Court’s undermining of the
Effective Vindication Doctrine in Italian Colors, defendants’ efforts to
dismantle these pro-plaintiff components of antitrust law may prove more
successful in the future.

The problems associated with antitrust arbitration are magnified in
concentrated markets. Supporters of enforcing arbitration clauses assume
that they these contractual provisions are the result of an informed,
voluntary bargain. But when a market is dominated by a single supplier or a
small group of firms, consumers often find it impossible to purchase a
necessary product while retaining the right to sue, especially since
arbitration clauses are generally embedded in contracts of adhesion. This
means that in the markets most likely to be affected by antitrust
violations, consumers are least likely to be able to avoid mandatory
arbitration clauses. Furthermore, when mergers result in concentrated
markets, they can increase the problems explored in Part Two.

Watson, explains why exclusion-payment settlements, by which brand-name
drug companies pay generic firms to delay entering the market, contravene
the policies of patent law, antitrust law, and the Hatch-Waxman Act. It
addresses five points.

First, the settlements are not consistent with the Hatch-Waxman Act,
Congress’s framework for balancing patent and antitrust law in the
pharmaceutical industry, which encouraged generics to challenge patents.

Second, the settlements are anticompetitive, serving as a form of market
division, which is the practical result when brands pay generics to drop
challenges to weak patents and delay entering the market instead.

Third, the mere fact of a patent cannot justify the payments. The Patent
Office frequently issues invalid patents, and the patents at the heart of
these settlements present concern, often covering not the drug’s active
ingredient but narrower aspects like the formulation or method of use that
are less innovative and bear more potential for anticompetitive mischief.
Patent policy encourages challenges to weak patents, and the procedural
presumption of validity does not justify the settlements.

Fourth, exclusion payments are not needed to settle cases in the public
interest; history has shown that brands and generics can reach settlements
without them.

Fifth, the most appropriate antitrust framework employs a “quick look”
rule-of-reason analysis that treats exclusion payments as presumptively
unlawful. Such a framework recognizes the potentially severe
anticompetitive effects of exclusion-payment settlements while permitting
the settling parties to introduce possible procompetitive justifications,
if any, for their agreement.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:32.500583,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:34:57.852000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/citation/,9c56p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3gvyb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/relationships/node/,3gvyb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c866c3594d9001e488f8a6/,57c866c3594d9001e488f8a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9c56p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9c56p

substantial overhaul of the patent system in the past sixty years. The most
significant change in the AIA was the move from a first to invent regime to
a first inventor to file regime. The goal of the move to first to file,
besides harmonization, is to encourage inventors to move with alacrity to
share their invention with the world.

There is an ambiguity in the AIA, however, that threatens that disclosure
objective. Some commentators have argued that Congress intended to
fundamentally change the rules of prior art in a way that would encourage
secrecy rather than disclosure. Under this interpretation of the new law,
an inventor can use its process in secret for commercial purposes,
potentially forever, and still file a patent on that invention at some
point in the future. Far from encouraging disclosure, on this
interpretation the effect of the AIA is to encourage secrecy and delay in
patenting. Curiously, the argument is that Congress signaled its intent to
make this fairly radical change by re-enacting language that had been in
the Patent Act for the last 140 years: the words ""public use.""

Because two of these commentators, Bob Armitage and Joe Matal, were
involved in the drafting of the AIA, this argument has carried substantial
weight, and the PTO in 2013 adopted regulations that read the term ""public
use"" in the AIA as meaning something completely different than it had for
the century before 2011.

In this paper, I make two points. First, as a matter of statutory
interpretation it is unlikely that Congress intended to make such a change,
not only because they readopted existing statutory language but because
other parts of the statute make no sense under such an interpretation.
Second, reading the AIA as making such a change would be unwise as a policy

degree, the courts’ interpretations of patent and trademark law accommodate
those differences. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that the patent
system must bend or break: a patent system that is not flexible enough to
account for these industry differences is unlikely to survive, let along
accomplish its stated goals. We believe the system has the flexibility to
do both, but this will require the courts to better recognize and use the
policy levers they have been given.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:43.186162,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:27:22.722000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/citation/,mv24x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a8yuc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/relationships/node/,a8yuc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c864fc594d9001e988f88b/,57c864fc594d9001e988f88b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv24x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mv24x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mv24x

source software, and accordingly whether and to what extent the open source
model can scale, replacing proprietary rights as a primary means of
production. In this study, we use the release by a biotechnology company of
similar software under both proprietary and open source licenses to
investigate who uses open source software and why. We find that academic
users are somewhat more likely to adopt open source software than private
firms. We find only modest differences in the willingness of open source
users to modify or improve existing programs. And we find that users of
open source software often make business decisions that seem indifferent to
the norms of open source distribution. Our findings cast some doubt on the
penetration of the open source ethos beyond traditional software markets.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:05.990923,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:25:39.820000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/citation/,f4nyq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uubkd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/relationships/node/,uubkd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c86498b83f6901e9cd7ee8/,57c86498b83f6901e9cd7ee8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4nyq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f4nyq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f4nyq
