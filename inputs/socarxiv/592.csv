Although scholars have suggested a number of potential correlates of mass killings, it remains unclear whether the estimates are robust to different model specifications, or which variables accurately predict the onset of large-scale violence. We employ extreme bounds analysis and distributed random forests to test the sensitivity of 40 variables on a sample of 177 countries from 1945 to 2013. The results help clear the brush around mass killings, as few variables in this literature are robust determinants of atrocity. However, support for an opportunity logic persists as greater constraints on a government limit its ability to employ barbarous tactics. It appears that the Conflict Trap applies to government atrocity.

further develop existing system theoretical approaches of the public sphere towards a theory

network and public arenas models, as well as to interdisciplinary complexity research. I
introduce the fundamental characteristics of complex systems; i.e. interconnectedness, selforganization,

Drawing on an analysis of newspaper articles about the Oosterweelconnection in Antwerp (Belgium), it concludes that framing through imaginative appeals and framing through evidence mutually reinforce each other in a spiralling pattern. When evidence backs up appeals to the imagination, such as when facts back up metaphors, these appeals are endowed with authority and hence legitimacy. While this strengthens appeals that have been ”proven” to be true, it also makes actors backing these appeals increasingly frustrated with other parties that still refuse to accept them. Because of their frustration, the former are spurred to launch new imaginative appeals conveying their anger and to seek new evidence to substantiate these new appeals.

The study includes 15 female students of the third secondary grade enrolled in Third Secondary School for Females in Al-Quway'iyah. The data were collected from a diagnostic writing test requiring the students to write a composition about one of three topics. The students' errors were classified into 15 different categories and analyzed using the Error Analysis Matrix. The findings show that most secondary students who were learning EFL made errors in syntax. Also, the study reveals that the students face complexity with different grammatical errors in terms of using punctuation, using articles, spelling, verbs, conjunctions, capitalization, fragments, lexicon, subject omission, pronouns, prepositions, using adjectives, and using nouns; that may hinder understanding the written text.

It is employed as a means to reinforce the plot and to catalyze the actions of the play. This thesis addresses this importance as it relates to simulating the actions of the play and the effects this character leads to. I have focused on the dark side of the absent character and on how it succeeds in creating a hunting presence. My selected pivots on Susan Glaspell's Trifles, Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh, Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie and Edward Albee's who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Focusing on these representative plays, I have found that the absent character is so overwhelming that it becomes a presence on the stage. Its haunting presence usually destroys and paralyzes the lives of the onstage characters and creates a negative impact on the viewer.",TRUE,FALSE,absent character|Edward Albee|Eugene O'Neill|modern American drama|Susan Glaspell|Tennessee William,2018-07-02T11:51:29.848749,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-13T18:44:40.442361,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/citation/,w8efk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nf6cr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/relationships/node/,nf6cr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af7beb17bf0b90010e57b9f/,5af7beb17bf0b90010e57b9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8efk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8efk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8efk,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.203

A number of factors account for this including the amount of time allocated to spoken English in the curriculum and the lack of students' interest and subject confidence by the time they reach Grade 5. This study uses the Research Onion methodology to explore the potential for using digital tools (Apps and tablets) to increase the motivation and engagement of 5th grade young Arab EFL learners in Kuwait, improve their levels of spoken English and expand their learning space beyond the classroom into the home and everyday activities. It adopts the mixed methods approach and uses sample groups of students, parents and teachers from one school in Kuwait, including an online quantitative survey and semi-structured qualitative oral interviews, to gain insights into the topic. The results showed that the digital tools can have a positive impact on EFL learners speaking proficiency, and the increase of their sense of motivation to communicate but the newness of the idea in the Kuwaiti context raises questions for some parents and teachers in relation to their expectations based on the traditional teaching methods and curriculum.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab EFL learners|digital tools|English proficiency|Kuwait|motivation|speaking skill|TELL,2018-07-02T11:51:29.818239,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-13T18:44:12.715853,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/citation/,qw5t8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tv7um/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/relationships/node/,tv7um,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af7bdac7bf0b90013e4d627/,5af7bdac7bf0b90013e4d627,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw5t8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qw5t8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qw5t8,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.181
