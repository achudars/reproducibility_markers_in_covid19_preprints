As part of my broader doctoral research on non-government Jordanian radio today, it takes a linguistical anthropological perspective focused on the notion of indexicality: the non-referential meanings that are invoked contingently in language use, and thus articulate links to broader social and cultural ideologies, including stereotypes of identity categories such as gender and geographic origins.

I examine two case studies in which speakers problematise and reframe such stereotypes. The first involves the indexical mechanism of implicature, whereby a talk show caller mounts a challenge to dominant discourses of urban linguistic refinement through the ironic use of a ‘sanitised’ pronunciation of a local Jordanian dish (ča‘āčīl / ka‘ākīl). The second, from a programme in honour of a Jordanian pilot executed by the Islamic State (IS) in Syria, exhibits the performance of an evaluative stance towards Jordanian military activity as a form of patriotic nationalism, through the use of the [g] pronunciation of the sound /q/ (qāf) by a female broadcaster – a usage that defies gendered linguistic norms Jordanian radio, which require female speakers to use the [ʔ] (glottal stop) pronunciation instead.

While these contingent uses of implicature and stance form challenges to certain dominant discourses, they are nevertheless ambiguous in that they draw on other problematic ideologies, including localist linguistic ‘authenticity’ and patriotic Jordanian nationalism. Thus, while details of language use provide important potential for dissent, this paper also problematises this potential – asking whether (1) subversive linguistic practices always need to draw on other dominant discourses in order to be meaningful, and (2) whether such references necessarily make dissent compromised or illegitimate.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab media|Jordan|linguistic anthropology|Middle East studies|radio|resistance,2018-07-02T11:15:52.015690,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-14T05:34:46.165960,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c98|Arts and Humanities|Near Eastern Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/citation/,qfc7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5976e7716c613b022b38a3a8/,5976e7716c613b022b38a3a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qfc7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qfc7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qfc7y,NA

That has clearly changed. While Google Scholar shows only nine results for the phrase “sociology of quantification” through 2007, the last decade returns 448. This proliferation of scholarship on numbers goes hand in hand with a proliferation of numbers themselves. New technologies have created a “quantified self,” and the explosion of the internet has produced “big data”. As a senior sociologist recently quipped to one of us, sociology has become quantitative researchers, and qualitative researchers studying quantification. Thus the moment seems ripe for revisiting the sociology of quantification, looking at emerging themes, and seeking signs that a new subfield might be starting to consolidate.

Alas, the news is mixed. Lots of good work is being done. The intellectual space is full of ferment. Yet—and perhaps the fact that we were reviewing books by authors from at least four different disciplines should have clued us in earlier—so far, we seem to be looking at a genre, not a subfield....",TRUE,FALSE,algorithms|big data|numbers|quantification|quantified self|rankings|valuation,2018-07-02T11:15:51.943636,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-14T03:08:00.435059,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/citation/,4sgc2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z5mxh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/relationships/node/,z5mxh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e17e7db83f6902b005f002/,59e17e7db83f6902b005f002,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sgc2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4sgc2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4sgc2,https://doi.org/10.1177/0094306118767649

As shorthand, I describe this as an evolution from Gun Culture 1.0 to Gun Culture 2.0.  In this paper, I begin by giving a brief history of the rise of Gun Culture 2.0. I then propose a cultural approach to studying gun culture, based on a working definition of culture that emphasizes the ways in which culture helps us to understand the world by defining problems and prospects and helps us to act in the world by suggesting recipes and providing tools for action in relation to those problems and prospects. Here, objects of material culture like guns and gun-related accessories play an important role. Far from being static entities, in addressing the problems associated with carrying concealed weapons in everyday life, these technologies respond to and facilitate the cultural practice of gun carrying which is central to Gun Culture 2.0.  I apply this cultural approach to studying gun culture using ethnographic observation of a Concealed Carry Expo to explore some of the many technologies that have been developed to help those who want to be armed citizens reconcile the competing demands of carrying a concealed handgun in public.

Despite this marked increase in the use of ART, little is known about the demographic consequences.  We explore several dimensions of demographic consequences of ART.  The proportion of ART-conceived babies varies greatly across countries, and our analyses suggest that ART costs, policies and regulations, and national norms and values are core determinants of these differences.  Based on a review of the literature, we conclude that ART has a negligible impact on national fertility rates, thereby suggesting that it is not an effective policy instrument to counter low fertility.  Furthermore, we show that the recent increase in twin births in Europe can be attributed to ART usage.

The weight in performance, in aptitude in a manner unnoticed has the advantage that the less noticeable one is as a
threat to whatever, a job position or as an adversary the freer one is to continue with one’s task.
With the advent of the millennium, like a silent ninja India struck the world with its capabilities with respect to

One promising approach is addressing unconscious bias in teachers, which may impact teacher expectations and interactions with students. Since early intervention literature indicates that asking individuals to suppress biases is counterproductive, our work uses online interactive case
studies as practice spaces to focus on teaching decisions that may be impacted by unconscious bias.
