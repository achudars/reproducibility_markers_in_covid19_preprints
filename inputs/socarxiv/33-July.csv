Although a growing body of scholarship has emerged to assess the normative and legal dimensions of these regulatory developments in Germany and beyond, the legal scholarship on intermediary liability leaves key questions about why and how these policies are developed, shaped, and adopted unanswered. The goal of this article is thus to provide a deep case study into the NetzDG from a regulatory politics perspective, highlighting the importance of political and regulatory factors currently under-explored in the burgeoning interdisciplinary literatures on platform governance and platform regulation. The empirical account presented here, which draws on 30 interviews with stakeholders involved in the debate around the NetzDG’s adoption, as well as hundreds of pages of deliberative documents obtained via freedom of information access requests, outlines how the NetzDG took shape, and how it overcame various significant obstacles (ranging from resistance from other stakeholders and the European Union’s frameworks against regulatory fragmentation) to eventually become law.

Nonetheless, the meaning of the term remains ambiguous. This article approaches this ambiguity by understanding sustainable finance as a contested concept, whose meaning has been subject to varying interpretations by different actors. To map these interpretations, the article offers an inductive analysis of the network of actors that concern themselves with sustainable finance. Inside of this network actors offer competing interpretations of sustainable finance which can be conceptualised as frames. Using network analysis and interviews I identify five frames that are present in three periods between 1998 and 2018. Distinct communities advance a Socially Responsible Investment frame, a risks and opportunities frame, a climate finance frame, a critical frame and an integrated frame that tries to bring the different actors together.

This study aims to translate residents’ and local organizations’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions into the emergency planning agenda of cities. The study underlines the multifunctionality of existing public facilities to raise urban flexibility, in particular, if there is a need to increase the open public space capacity of dense built-up urban areas in emergency conditions.
Design/methodology/approach
The preliminary accessibility analysis was conducted using the public schools of Bahcelievler in Istanbul Metropolitan to study whether there are ways to improve open public space deficits in high-densely urban environments. In addition, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were mapped using Remote Sensing to identify the existence of greenery and vacant lands for future interventions. The literature review on multifunctionality was applied to propagate the formulation of the research problems and identify the potential research idea. 
Findings 
The preliminary analysis’ results have shown that by including open public space of schools into public use about 96,740 m2 of open space will be added to the Bahcelievler District. In addition, this study conceptualizes a new research idea by inviting policymakers and planners to reinvent traditionally defined multifunctionality concepts in emergency planning of public facilities. This study suggested a guideline that underlines three spatial, temporal, and regulative aspects for the resident-based emergency planning of public facilities.  
Social implications
The multifunctionality of public facilities improves neighborhood walkability, supports mixed land uses as a critical component of achieving better places to live, and addresses the diversity of opportunities within the walking distance.

Study Design: We conducted a comprehensive keyword search of YouTube videos related to self-removal of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)—namely intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants. We analyzed video content to explore demographic characteristics, method and duration of LARC use, and motivations and experiences of self-removal. 
Results: Our keyword search identified 58 videos that met the criteria for inclusion, including 48 videos that featured individuals who removed an IUD and 10 who removed an implant. Collectively, videos had over 4 million views. We identified most video creators as white (53.4%), 31% as Black, and 14.3% as Latinx. Reasons for LARC discontinuation included negative side effects, fear of potential side effects, and desire for pregnancy. Users were motivated to remove their own device by both preferences and barriers to formal care. Fifty-six individuals (96.6%) successfully removed their device, and most described their experience in positive terms related to the ease of removal. 
Conclusion: This study builds upon prior research by describing publicly available information about LARC self-removal. The over-representation of Black women in our sample may reflect a higher prevalence of LARC self-removal among this population. Positive experiences of self-removal and high levels of viewer engagement with online videos suggest a greater need for provider counseling on LARC removal at the time of insertion. 
Implications: Prior to LARC insertion, patients should be made aware of any financial requirements for discontinuation.

Here we develop a dynamic-spatial multi-industry climate-economy model with several novel forms of heterogeneity. In our model, regions are linked through trade and factor markets, and daily temperature affects productivity growth and local amenities. We first demonstrate how to use equilibrium conditions of the model to estimate climate impacts on growth and amenities accounting for dynamic and spatial behavior. With a focus on the United States, we then simulate our model to quantify the value of adaptation through inter-state migration or by changing workers' industry of employment, which alter production patterns and trade. We find that market adaptation mitigates and even reverses the negative effects of climate change in the US. In total, market-based adaptation improves US welfare by 14 percentage points. Heterogeneity in industrial responses to climate change and within-year temperature variability play a central role in welfare and the benefits of adaptation. Heterogeneous industrial responses make climate change more beneficial by magnifying the benefits of trade and industry switching. Differences in temperature variability across space and time worsen welfare, and depress the value of adaptation through trade, migration, and industry switching.

Abstract—The increasing deployment of machine learning systems has raised many concerns about its varied negative societal impacts. Notable among policy proposals to mitigate these issues is the notion that (some) machine learning systems should be certified. In this paper, we illustrate how recent approaches to certifying machine learning may be building upon the wrong foundations and examine what better foundations may look like. While prominent approaches to date have centered on networking standards initiatives led by organizations including the IEEE or ISO, we argue that machine learning certification may be better grounded in the very different institutional structures found in the sustainability domain. We first illustrate how policy challenges of machine learning and sustainability have significant structural similarities. Like many commodities, machine learning is characterized by difficult or impossible to observe credence properties, such as the characteristics of data collection, or carbon emissions from model training, as well as value chain issues, such as emerging core-periphery inequalities, networks of labor, and fragmented and modular value creation. We examine how focusing on networking standards, as is currently done, is likely to fail as a method to govern the credence properties of machine learning. While networking standards typically draw their adoption and enforcement from a functional need to conform in order to participate in a network, salient policy issues in machine learning issues benefit from no such dynamic. Finally, we apply existing research on certification systems for sustainability to the qualities and challenges of machine learning to generate lessons across the two, aiming to inform design considerations for emerging regimes.",TRUE,FALSE,ai|certification|credence goods|data protection|machine learning|private governance|standards|sustainability,2021-06-02T17:31:22.935433,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T17:25:12.851878,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/citation/,pm3wy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b697089096b70221640026/,60b697089096b70221640026,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm3wy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pm3wy/,https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.12417,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pm3wy

Researchers use these covert experiments to make strong causal claims about difficult-to-detect behavior, such as racial, gender, and other types of discrimination. These studies have consistently uncovered discrimination in multiple stages and contexts of the housing exchange process. The housing audit literature is broad and robust, and a number of in-depth reviews already exist. In this chapter, we build on those reviews by focusing attention on emerging areas of inquiry and suggest new avenues of research pursuits.  We begin by briefly reviewing the long history of housing audits including in-person HUD audits and correspondence audits of home sales and housing rentals. Next, we discuss three emerging areas of housing audit research – housing choice vouchers, short-term rentals, and roommate searches – and highlight important findings, new innovations, and areas of weakness. Finally, we conclude with a discussion about future directions of housing audits including using experiments to test for ways to reduce discrimination, using additional data to examine the mechanisms of housing discrimination, and designing modified audits to explore discrimination in other stages of housing exchange.",TRUE,FALSE,audit studies|audit study|disability|discrimination|field experiment|housing|inequality|race|race/ethnicity,2021-06-02T17:21:44.727551,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T17:19:40.948898,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",S.

Income composition inequality is defined as the extent to which the income composition in capital and labor income is unevenly distributed across the income distribution. High levels of income composition inequality are associated with class-fragmented societies, whereas low levels are typical of multiple-sources-of-income societies. We find that a higher seat share of left parties in the governing coalition and higher globalization, as measured by trade, capital openness, and FDI inflows, are linked to lower income composition inequality. Higher economic development and a higher capital income share are, instead, related to higher inequality in income composition. We discuss the mechanisms behind these relationships and check the robustness of our findings. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies looking into the causes of the dynamics of this dimension of economic inequality.

This article outlines a framework that I implemented when delivering a community-engaged course during the earlier days of COVID-19. I argue that these guiding principles—centering the community partners' needs, assessing, and remaining flexible to students' circumstances, and cautiously mapping and selectively using institutional resources to deliver the course—allowed me to provide a community-engaged experience to undergraduate students despite pandemic restrictions. At the same time, I ensured that the intersectional feminist and critical ethos of the class were not compromised and that the commitment to the community partners' sustainability was not cast aside. Additionally, I share two detailed exemplars of community-based learning projects highlighting the possibilities, challenges, and limitations when applying this framework. I close this piece with several points of departure to stimulate future conversation among educators, researchers, and practitioners on the role of community-based service-learning during times of societal crisis.",TRUE,FALSE,centering the partnership|critical community-engaged learning|pandemic teaching|student-centered service learning,2021-06-02T17:27:20.821141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T17:23:14.359972,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Angie Mejia,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/citation/,mbxu7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b65a1f3a6df101eed511db/,60b65a1f3a6df101eed511db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbxu7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbxu7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mbxu7
