Yet as admission to selective colleges has become increasingly competitive, a market for services to help students succeed in the application process has rapidly expanded. When is participation in this market understood to be morally legitimate? Research on moral markets has examined how participants distinguish legitimate from illegitimate markets, and how relational strategies can hide or purify illegitimate transactions. Less attention has been paid to why groups define a market as legitimate, particularly when its existence conflicts with other group values. Drawing on digital ethnography of an online forum for current and prospective Taiwanese international students and interviews with forum participants, we find that participants define the purchase of college admissions services as moral when it is compensating for collective disadvantage, yet reject its morality in other contexts. Paying to beat a “meritocratic” system becomes legitimate when one recognizes one’s systematic disadvantage in that system.

By focusing on a major childcare reform in East and West Germany, we examine the effect in two contexts that differ markedly in the acceptance and use of formal childcare and maternal employment. We combine rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2006 to 2014) with annual administrative county-level data on the availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare, estimating event history models. The results indicate that increased childcare availability for under-three-year-olds reduces mothers’ employment interruptions, particularly after a second childbirth, and increases the probability of returning to part-time or full-time employment as opposed to marginal employment. Furthermore, increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare increases mothers’ likelihood of returning to employment in the second year after childbirth, when paid leave entitlements expire and the availability of childcare becomes important. However, our results are only statistically significant for West German mothers and only after the birth of a second child.

David and I did not know each other well, but shared a belief that our open source community (OSC, hereafter) was an unsafe place for anyone who did not identify as white, cisgendered, heterosexual and male. That lack of safety was further complicated by any one individual’s distance from privileged modes of contribution. In OSC, developers who were on key Contribution Teams and regularly added code to the codebase were valued more highly than those who contributed documentation, user experience research, or quality assurance work. David asked ”What if we made a survey that accounted for all of the ways that people make the web? Can we do it intersectionally? Can we do it the OSC way?” Over the following 18 months, David and I worked with a team of OSC community members on the creation, dissemination and analysis of a quantitative demographic survey of OSC.

In addition to the original event, which continues, the various spino  events, e.g. TEDMed or TEDGlobal, and the localized versions (TEDx), there is a TED radio hour on National Public Radio as well as a considerable infrastructure designed to formalize the inclusion of TED talks in education. The nature of a TED talk has so saturated American culture that one of us has documented, in fact, the saying noted above offered when someone has monopolized conversation too long: “Thanks for coming to my TED talk.”",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-17T17:37:22.179703,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-17T17:36:56.308762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/citation/,4yqex,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da77210f6b03e000e20c3cb/,5da77210f6b03e000e20c3cb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yqex/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4yqex/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4yqex,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.042

Prior computational analyses attempting to analyze these elements have primarily relied on summarizing relatively low-level-features. Beginning with the early work of Barry Salt, one particularly prominent metric is the distribution of median shot lengths. Works on shot length include Yuri Tsivian’s Cinemetrics project, Arclight, and Jeremy Butler’s ShotLogger. Other computational analyses examine the aggregation of language and average shot color, image compositions, and analysis of  film scripts. These projects have demonstrated the feasibility of distributing extracted metadata from copyrighted materials and the power of computational techniques in accessing useful information over a large collection of moving images. However, there is much to be learned from other extractable metadata beyond shot detection and much to be studied in audiovisual media that can only be discovered through computer vision.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-17T17:31:43.145695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-17T17:31:21.499279,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/citation/,28xmf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da77052a7bc73000bef022b/,5da77052a7bc73000bef022b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28xmf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/28xmf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/28xmf,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.043

Data, for the informaticist, are facts, measurements or statistics. For the historian, data are historical remnants—often preserved by an archive. For the anthropologist, data can be quantitative or qualitative depending on the question and methods. Disciplinary methods aside, data are not value-neutral and thus must be contextualized in terms of their acquisition, analysis, and interpretation in order to transform data into information. For humanists, the cultural complexities of data and information are not new. Anthropologists, historians, linguists, museum curators, and archivists have long probed the contextual subjectivities of knowledge production and representation. From ink and quill maps representing the New World to the carefully stratifed layers of an archeological site, data in the humanities are always subject to the systems of knowledge that were used to capture, represent, and disseminate them.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-17T17:29:21.384543,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-17T17:28:56.810990,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/citation/,sxnzp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da76efdf6b03e000d229546/,5da76efdf6b03e000d229546,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxnzp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sxnzp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sxnzp,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.044
