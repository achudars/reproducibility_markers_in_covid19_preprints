It has a long history and rich and colorful folk-custom characteristics, such as the family reunion, eating dumplings, setting off firecrackers, pasting the spring couplets, etc. Those characteristics are the reflections of traditional Chinese thinking ways and the thoughts of Confucianism. For Passover, it is like the twin-brother of the Spring Festival. During Passover, the Jewish people gather and commemorate the grace of God and the hardship of the ancestors. Passover opens a door for the further study on the thoughts and culture of the ancient Israelites, and their view on God. Their folk customs including family reunion, brushing the lamb blood on the door frame, eating  unleavened bread and bitter herbs, and some other folk events that are similar to those of the Spring Festival. From the paper, we can get a hypothesis that the beast Xi(夕) is Set with Chinese characteristic. By the way, from the paper, we can get a hypothesis that God in Judaism and Shangdi(上帝) and Tian(天) are nearly the same. Besides, we can also get a hypothesis that the Christian notion of a divine right of kings resembles the Mandate of Heaven(天命). By the way, from the paper, we can get a conclusion that Qi(弃) is actually Hemaka. Besides, from the paper, we can say that the origin of the doctrine of the mean may be the scales of justice emblem of the tribe of Dan. Furthermore, most of Q-M242 people in East Asia belong to subclade Q-M120, which distributes most intensively across northern China. The average frequency of Q-M242 in northern China is around 4.5%. However, it decreases to about 2% in southern China. According to the dynastic race theory, the Haplogroup of the elite of the ancient Egypt(especially pharaohs) may be Q. By the way, the highest frequency of Q1b1 in Europe is found among Ashkenazi Jews (5%) and Sephardic Jews (2%), suggesting that Q1b was present in the Levant before the Jewish disapora 2,000 years ago. In fact, Jewish Q1b all belong to the Y2200 subclade, which was formed some 2,600 years ago. So in all, we can get a hypothesis that Zhou People(周人) may be the Tribe of Dan , one of the tribes of Israel.",TRUE,FALSE,God in Judaism|Hemaka|Mandate of Heaven(天命)|Passover|Qi(弃)|Set|Shangdi(上帝)|Spring Festival|the beast Xi(夕)|the doctrine of the mean|the tribe of Dan|Tian(天)|Zhou People(周人),2020-04-12T12:10:40.828099,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T10:36:40.099677,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History,Bohai Xu,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/citation/,gvj3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e92d855430166031da1213b/,5e92d855430166031da1213b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvj3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvj3u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvj3u,NA

However, few studies explore how older siblings influence their younger siblings’ education trajectory including primary, secondary, and post-secondary education. Drawing on 25 in-depth interviews with Latino/a first generation college students at a large research university in Southern California, I find that older siblings assist their younger family members by (a) choosing schools, (b) assisting with reading comprehension, (c) helping with homework assignments, and (d) post high school preparation. In doing do, they demystify norms and rules about education and attempt to position their loved ones on a path of upward mobility.

Besides suggesting the relationships between these two sets of disadvantages are significant in determining the net disadvantage black Americans are subjected to, I build on the findings of Bruch (2014), demonstrating via Interactive Markov Models and analysis of recent American Community Survey data that higher levels of Inversely-Related Disadvantages can have a positive effect on the neighborhood black proportion Affluent Blacks experience, but only when Between-Race Inequality is low.",TRUE,FALSE,neighborhood disadvantage|racial inequality|racism|residential preferences|segregation,2020-04-12T03:36:22.709138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:36:03.202136,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/citation/,ydt9b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e92232cf13535032ad559c9/,5e92232cf13535032ad559c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydt9b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydt9b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydt9b,NA

Isolation and contact tracing to identify all infected people are key public health interventions necessary to control infectious disease outbreaks. However, these activities are dependent upon the surveillance platform to identify infections quickly. A robust surveillance platform can also reinforce community adherence to behavioral interventions such as social distancing. In situations where contact tracing is feasible, all suspected cases and contacts of confirmed cases must be tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectively isolated. At the community level wastewater surveillance can identify areas where transmission is or is not occurring, and genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can help to elucidate the intensity of transmission independent of the number of known cases and hospitalizations.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, the tool most commonly used to convey statistical information about the spread of the virus has been time-series graphs about the cumulative number of cases. When drawing such graphs, analysts have to make design decisions which can have dramatic effects on citizens’ interpretations. Plotting the COVID-19 progression on a linear scale highlights an exponential “explosion” in the number of cases, whereas plotting the number of cases on a logarithmic scale produces a line with a modest-looking slope. Even if the two graphs display the exact same information, differences in visual design may lead people to different substantive conclusions. In this study, we measure the causal effect of different visualization design choices on Canadians’ views about the crisis.

In this paper we present an initial release of a large hand-coded dataset of more than 4,500 separate policy announcements from governments around the world. This data is being made publicly available, in combination with other data that we have collected (including COVID-19 tests, cases, and deaths) as well as a number of country-level covariates. Due to the speed of the COVID-19 outbreak, we will be releasing this data on a daily basis with a 5-day lag for record validity checking. In a truly global effort, our team is comprised of more than 190 research assistants across 18 time zones and makes use of cloud-based managerial and data collection technology in addition to machine learning coding of news sources. We analyze the dataset with a Bayesian time-varying ideal point model showing the quick acceleration of more harsh policies across countries beginning in mid-March and continuing to the present. While some relatively low-cost policies like task forces and health monitoring began early, countries generally adopted more harsh measures within a narrow time window, suggesting strong policy diffusion effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian|coronavirus|COVID19|item response theory|policy response,2020-04-12T03:31:20.661116,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:30:56.355464,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/citation/,dkvxy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6j7sm/,6j7sm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e904f91d697350283bdc5c1/,5e904f91d697350283bdc5c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dkvxy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dkvxy,NA

We study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on electoral choice based on the case of Germany, one of the countries most heavily affected by the crisis. Our data come from the German state of Bavaria, where local elections were held right at the beginning of the pandemic. The elections took place early during the outbreak when there was still substantial variation in the extent to which individual counties and municipalities were affected by the outbreak. This variation provides a unique opportunity to study the causal impact of an event that would shortly after grow into an all-encompassing epidemic. We provide evidence that shows that the disease spread across the state in a mostly haphazard fashion. This lack of a discernible pattern coupled with within-county estimation of effects and a difference-in-differences strategy allow us to causally asses the effect of the spreading of the virus on electoral outcomes. Our results show that the crisis strongly and consistently benefited the dominant regional party, the CSU, and its candidates. For 3 known cases per 100,000 inhabitants, vote shares increased by about 4 percent. We explain our findings with a strategic-alignment mechanism, whereby voters vote into power candidates that they deem most likely to be able to solicit support from higher levels of government. Our findings emphasize the merit of forward-looking theories of voting and provide insights on the functioning of democracy during times of crisis.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Elections|Germany|Incumbency effect|Voting,2020-04-12T03:29:33.610522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:29:00.598111,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Arndt Leininger and Max Schaub,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/citation/,a32r7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e903bb0d697350283bda52d/,5e903bb0d697350283bda52d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a32r7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a32r7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a32r7,NA

Children-performers produce videos featuring implicit sexual imagery to satisfy the demands of an adult fan base, and in exchange for a digital reward. We first report the discovery of several YouTube keywords leading to such content, outlining their remarkable interconnectedness via analysis of search trends over the last decade. Following, we investigate audience-child interactions by semantic analysis of n=1398 comments mined from n=30 videos, revealing the occurrence of collective grooming. We then demonstrate how this phenomenon is sustained and enhanced by YouTube search algorithms. Following, we detail a model framework to contextualise our findings. Finally, we propose specific amendments to the 2018 Online Harms White Paper that might tackle this phenomenon. Our  results  reveal  a  new  form  of  child  abuse, as  of  yet  undescribed,  wherein  the  core  features  of  online  grooming  are  translated  to  social media, the fundamental principles of which act  as  a  powerful  incentive.  Because  the  victim’s  manipulation  is  enacted  collectively,  we believe  that  responsibility  ultimately  rests  with society as a whole. The principal aim here is to raise awareness of this issue, in an attempt to kick-start discussion of its causes, implications and potential solutions.",TRUE,FALSE,child abuse|like|social media|Youtube,2020-04-12T03:30:21.412716,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:30:07.291855,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Child Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/citation/,cyq4r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c68rp/,c68rp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e90370ff135350293d558cd/,5e90370ff135350293d558cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyq4r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cyq4r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cyq4r,NA
