Mapping the third space of ICT integration in early childhood education,"The current stage of early years information and communication technology (ICT) integration research has been criticized for not paying enough attention to the unique pedagogical features of early childhood education. Similarly, children’s views about educational use of ICT have been underrepresented in research. This dissertation study contributes to resolving these gaps in the literature by exploring children’s ideas and preservice teachers’ beliefs regarding the role of ICT in early childhood education.

The study consists of two data sets that are reported in three empirical articles. The first study focused on children’s ideas and their contextual roots. The second study explored preservice teachers’ beliefs about children and ICT at home. The third study investigated preservice teachers’ perceptions of ICT integration through the frames of teaching, education, and care, referred to as the EDUCARE approach. In this compilation, the findings of the empirical studies are scrutinized through the analytical device of third space theory.

The findings suggest that there is a dissonance between the meanings children and preservice teachers give to ICT use. Children conceptualized ICT use as a leisure activity whereas preservice teachers approached ICT mainly through learning. The findings also imply that although EDUCARE has been described as a holistic framework in the context of ICT integration, the framework acts as a disintegrating vehicle: When ICT integration was approached from the perspective of teaching, the views were mainly positive. When the perspective was changed to care, the views were profoundly negative. Care-related concerns were associated with preservice teachers’ beliefs about children’s use of ICT at home being extensive and unregulated. Another exaggerated belief was considering children born-competent ICT users.

The results of this study have several implications for early childhood education, as well as preservice teacher education. To make ICT pedagogy truly meaningful for children, ICT should be approached as a cultural form, and space should be given for children’s views, values, and experiences. Additionally, educational technology courses need to pay more attention to aspects of care, as well as to preservice teachers’ often unrealistic beliefs about children and technology.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital media|early childhood education|educational technology|technology integration|Third space,2019-05-27T12:49:42.277983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-27T12:49:20.299173,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/citation/,tf4rk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cea6c122a50c4001781b5df/,5cea6c122a50c4001781b5df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tf4rk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tf4rk,NA

The role of feelings in the persistence of marriage as an institution,"Despite cohabitation becoming increasingly equivalent to marriage in some of the most ‘advanced’ Western European societies, the vast majority of people still marry. Why so? Existing theories, mostly based on various approaches tied to cognitive decision‐making, do not provide a sufficient explanation of the persistence of marriage. In this article, we argue that feelings attached to marriage, i.e. the affective evaluation of those involved in a partner relationship concerning marriage as opposed to cohabitation, explain the persistent importance of marriage as an institution. We argue that socialization, biological and social‐structural factors affect these affective evaluations. We provide a test of our hypotheses using a longitudinal study of young adults in the Netherlands.

By inviting women to share their ordinarily silenced stories, the hashtag #MeToo surfaced a network of survivors to confront this stigma. Through a mixed-methods analysis of over 1.5 million tweets posted during the first two weeks after #MeToo gained widespread popularity in 2017, we map the landscape of disclosures that emerged and disentangle the effects of network-level reciprocal disclosures, or disclosures made in reaction to seeing others disclose. We detail how survivors disclosed a diversity of sexual violence experiences in solidarity with others, composing nearly half of all authored tweets and comprising a disproportionate number of interactions within the #MeToo network. Further, we show that the more disclosures an individual potentially saw prior to disclosing, the more likely they were to share details with their disclosure. We argue that such network-level reciprocal disclosures may have reduced stigma, creating a counterpublic space safe for disclosure which, subsequently, generated more disclosures. Our work illustrates how feminist hashtag activism, like #MeToo, can unify individual and collective narratives to dismantle the stigma surrounding disclosures of sexual violence.

We are concerned about the design, analysis, reporting and reviewing of quantitative IS studies that draw on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). We observe that debates about misinterpretations, abuse, and issues with NHST, while having persisted for about half a century, remain largely absent in IS. We find this an untenable position for a discipline with a proud quantitative tradition. We discuss traditional and emergent threats associated with the application of NHST and examine how they manifest in recent IS scholarship. To encourage the development of new standards for NHST in hypothetico-deductive IS research, we develop a balanced account of possible actions that are implementable short-term or long-term and that incentivize or penalize specific practices.

Data were collected by interviewing children in their homes. Children chose eight toys from a tailored catalog and explained why they wanted those particular items. Toys were analyzed with the aid of a framework designed to test their functional manipulation potential. The children's reasoning was analyzed by means of inductive content analysis. Two kinds of values were found: (1) those which reside in the toy itself and (2) those which children give to toys. Sub-categories relating to material, social, and personal values were identified from the given values.

The main findings, based on data driven analysis, were the following: Playing commercial digital games was the most popular activity followed by media production, mainly photographing. Computers, tablets and cameras were the most popular devices. Digital media was understood to be more about leisure than learning. Pedagogical implementations are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital games|Digital media|Early Childhood|Preschool,2019-05-24T12:41:03.636525,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-24T12:40:35.649520,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/citation/,u3pzc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce7b33335f2580016ac63f1/,5ce7b33335f2580016ac63f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3pzc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u3pzc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u3pzc,https://doi.org/10.18261/issn.1891-943x2016-04-01

However, while ubicomp and IoT are changing and shaping children’s digital and technological landscape, not much is known about how children perceive these omnipresent and concealed forms of digital technology. This qualitatively oriented paper explores 3‐ to 6‐year‐old Finnish children’s perceptions of ubicomp and IoT via interviews and a design task. Initially, the children were skeptical toward the idea that tangible objects, such as toys, could be computer and/or Internet enabled. However, these perceptions were subject to change when children were introduced to a scientific conception of what computers and the Internet are and asked to apply their knowledge to a technological design task. Implications for early years digital literacy education are discussed in the paper.",TRUE,FALSE,Childhood|Digital literacy|Internet of Things|Ubiquitous computing,2019-05-24T13:38:02.443901,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-24T13:37:42.919201,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/citation/,8zkbh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce7b1b42a50c400177fd1bb/,5ce7b1b42a50c400177fd1bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zkbh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8zkbh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8zkbh,https://doi.org/10.1111/BJET.12821
