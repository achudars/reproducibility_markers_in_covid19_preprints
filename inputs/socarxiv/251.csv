Future sea level rise exposes coastal populations to a spectrum of risk, but assessments often define exposure narrowly, such as areas experiencing permanent inundation only. We reviewed the most common sea level rise exposure assessment methods and identified three widely used spatial definitions of physical exposure risk: mean higher high water, the 100-year floodplain, and the low-elevation coastal zone. Taken individually, each treat risk to sea level rise as binary (affected or not affected), resulting in narrow definitions, homogenizing risk and exposure across space and time. We present a framework that integrates and smooths these classifications under a single continuous metric. To do so, we advance a sophisticated spatiotemporal flood-modeling approach -- expected annual exposure -- based on a probabilistic spatial envelope that unifies spatial extents between the high-tide line and the 10,000-year floodplain. We show that the effects from sea level rise will impact far more people far sooner than previously thought. In particular, our results suggest that single, binary extent assessments either underestimate or overestimate the magnitude of the at-risk populations while also spatially homogenizing the impacts to sea level rise. Our advance on modeling annual exposure provides a more robust and holistic assessment of the populations most at-risk to flooding from sea level rise. This typology can be used to guide new research connecting risk of sea level rise to related adaptation policies and planning.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|climate impacts|flood risk|sea level rise,2020-06-11T00:53:05.488487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-11T00:52:40.955426,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/citation/,tf6rj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edfd4c58b542601e08b681a/,5edfd4c58b542601e08b681a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf6rj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tf6rj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tf6rj,NA

In this study, I demonstrate how alone time varies by gender and race-ethnicity by analyzing time diary data from the 2003-2019 American Time Use Survey. Results suggest gender and race-ethnicity are salient dimensions of how much time people spend alone, with Black men spending the most time alone and Hispanic women spending the least time alone.

But this accessibility is restricted to the consumption of knowledge. Epistemic injustices inhering in the scholarly communication of a global production of knowledge remain unchanged. This underscores that the commercial or big deal OA dominating Europe and North America have little revolutionary potential to democratise knowledge. Academia in the Global North, driven by politics of progressive neoliberalism, can even reinforce its hegemonic power by solidifying and legitimating contemporary hierarchies of scholarly communication through OA. In a critique of the notion of a democratisation of knowledge, I showcase manifestations of OA as either allowing consumption of existing discourse or as active participation of discourse in the making. The latter comes closer to being the basis for a democratisation of knowledge. I discuss this as I issue a threefold conceptualisation of epistemic injustices comprising of testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice, and epistemic objectification. As these injustices prevail, the notion of a democratisation of knowledge through OA is but another form of technological determinism that neglects the intricacies of culture and hegemony.",TRUE,FALSE,Democratisation of Knowledge|Epistemic Injustice|Open Access|Scholarly Communication|Social Epistemology|Technological Determinism,2020-06-09T16:34:43.632931,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-09T16:00:10.726298,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/citation/,hw7at,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edfa779c67d3001971f0149/,5edfa779c67d3001971f0149,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hw7at/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hw7at/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hw7at,NA

The transdisciplinarity presupposes bringing natural, social sciences and Indigenous knowledge together. Education research in the Arctic plays a key role in bridging Western science and Indigenous knowledge systems, as it seeks for methods to integrate Indigenous knowledge systems into schools and postsecondary institutions to develop sustainability. Even though Indigenous knowledge systems are considered to be essential for sustainable development and environmental management (Athayde et al. 2017), connections between Indigenous peoples, scientists, politicians are not yet sufficiently elaborated (Raymond at al. 2010). 
This paper examines several observations carried out during an ethnographic field work on urban Indigenous identity preservation and well-being in Anchorage, Alaska. The fieldwork in progress is being implemented in collaboration with the urban Yupik population. It throws light on challenges that might hinder the synthesis of Indigenous knowledge and Western science. For instance, one of the challenges under consideration has been that, while permissions to carry out participant observations were always easily obtained, allowing for building relationships and trust, the target population was, in most cases, reluctant when asked to be interviewed. While searching for the reasons of the unwillingness to participate in interviews, it became clear that the Alaska Native People do not trust researchers coming to work with them for a short period of time. Hence, long fieldworks should be implemented in order to have time to build trust. Another reason indicated is that the Alaska Native People learn through observing and listening to Elders, they do not like to consider themselves as experts. Thus, being interviewed is considered as showing expertise (Augusta Reimer, personal communication 2019). The observations examined in this paper will contribute to further understanding of differences in learning between Arctic Indigenous and Western knowledge systems.",TRUE,FALSE,co-production of knowledge|epistemological pluralism|Indigenous|sustainability|Western knowledge,2020-06-18T01:40:02.015117,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:39:35.657073,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,EHESS|Contributor: Olga Lauter,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/citation/,kvn2c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edf18018b5426019d8b368c/,5edf18018b5426019d8b368c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvn2c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kvn2c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kvn2c,NA

Our analysis from 147 largest cities in contemporary India shows how caste-based residential segregation is independent of city size (our sample includes all cities in India with at least 0.3 million residents in 2011). The extent of segregation in the largest metropolitan centers with over ten million residents closely tracks cities that are nearly two orders-of-magnitude smaller. We also show how residential segregation across a large swathe of urban India mirrors the spatial geometry of rural India. Our findings call into question one of the central normative promises of modernization in India and elsewhere --- the gradual withering of traditional ascriptive identities such as caste.

Self-described bulls are 5 times more likely to follow a user with a bullish view of the same stock than self-described bears. Consequently, bulls see 62 more bullish messages and 24 fewer bearish messages than bears over the same 50-day period. These “echo chambers” exist even among professional investors and are strongest for investors who trade on their beliefs. Finally, beliefs formed in echo chambers are associated with lower ex-post returns, more siloing of information and more trading volume.",TRUE,FALSE,Behavioral finance|Confirmation Bias|Selective Exposure|stock market,2020-06-18T01:36:07.654770,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:35:35.693154,FALSE,NA,no,"Data obtained from StockTwits, CRSP (paid provider), Compustat (paid provider) and other public sources",,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,J.

Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,"We use party-identifying language – like “Liberal Media” and “MAGA”– to identify Republican users on the investor social platform StockTwits. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that the beliefs of partisan Republicans about equities remain relatively unfazed during the COVID-19 pandemic, while other users become considerably more pessimistic. In cross-sectional tests, we find Republicans become relatively more optimistic about stocks that suffered the most from COVID-19, but more pessimistic about Chinese stocks. Finally, stocks with the greatest partisan disagreement on StockTwits have significantly more trading in the broader market, explaining 28% of the increase in stock turnover during the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Political economy|Stock market,2020-06-11T00:52:04.515143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-11T00:51:49.040674,FALSE,NA,no,"Data obtained from StockTwits, CRSP (paid service), Compustat (paid service) and other public sources",,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,J.
