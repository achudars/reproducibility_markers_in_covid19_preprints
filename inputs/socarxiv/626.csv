Mobile health interventions (mhealth) are a way to address existing barriers to treatment, provide frontline assessment and increase access to services for older adults. Due to perpetuated stereotypes, many assume that older adults do not utilize mobile technology nor will they accept a mHealth intervention. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize contemporary literature from information technology and healthcare regarding: (1) current mobile technology utilization by older adults, particularly in regards to health; (2) factors affecting older adult motivation to engage with mobile technology; and (3) older adult preferences for interacting with mobile technology. Findings reveal that significant proportions of older adults: already utilize mobile technology; are willing to engage in existing mobile interventions for health reasons; and have positive attitudes overall towards mobile technology. Finally, recommendations for optimizing mobile interventions to better suit older adults with behavioral health problems are reviewed.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral health|mHealth|mobile health|mobile technology|older adults,2018-07-02T10:59:34.508446,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-16T15:12:45.517573,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,Alexis Kuerbis|Adina Mulliken|Frederick Muench|Alison A .

Culture is always located somewhere and every cultural phenomenon is always decomposable into its lower level component units. Decomposition does not imply reduction, as emergence of higher level phenomena from the interaction of persons, their relations, and processes of recombination, transmission, learning, and memory is allowed for.

It has emerged as a distinct component of heavy drinking practice among young adults approximately between the ages of 18-25. This paper examines reflective accounts of female students’ pre-drinking and club-drinking. It explores the experience of pre-drinking in the context of the overall drinking sequence undertaken throughout the evening in and the night out. It finds that pre-drinking has a specific purpose for young women in managing risk, as well as ensuring a shared level of intoxication in preparation for entry into public drinking spaces.  Their accounts illustrate the performative nature of intoxication. Pre-drinking is highly directed, bounded, and ritualised. It was frequently, though not always, recounted as lacking in pleasure for these reasons.  It was associated with preparation for entry to a particular kind of superpub or nightclub especially, where the emphasis was on further rapid alcohol consumption.  Accounts of continued drinking in the nightclubs were dualistic, emphasising pleasure and disgust, along with risk and vulnerability. Risk was experienced as individualised, and the women had shared responsibility for guarding against risk from unsafe others in the nightclub environment. This coding of risk is supported by public health messages targeted at women drinkers and by the more general societal and drinks industry promoted representation of alcohol consumption as normal and abstinence as deviant, which students were critical of.  One attraction of pre-drinking for female students was as a way of protecting and supporting female agency in conditions of generalised, individualised vulnerability.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|alcohol|binge drinking|gender|predrinking|students,2018-07-02T10:59:34.376343,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-16T09:15:38.373927,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Angus Bancroft,2012,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/citation/,7hf8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z2rcp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/relationships/node/,z2rcp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5943a144594d900047bee77a/,5943a144594d900047bee77a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7hf8t/,https://doi.org/10.5153/sro.2785,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7hf8t

Individual characteristics of trustees, as determinants for being trusted, are thus getting increasingly important. In light of this societal development, this study is concerned with socioeconomic status and reputation as part of the explanans for interpersonal trust. Some have argued that lower status trustees are trusted more easily because of their repeated reliance on resources in their social network. Others state that higher status trustees are trusted more easily, for they are more vulnerable to social control and loss of reputation.

We propose a novel, quasi-experimental method for examining interpersonal trust situations mimicking the reality of peer-to-peer market platforms. 626 respondents were asked to place trust in their preferable trustee based on the asking price, and seller's characteristics. Conditional logistic regression models were estimated and showed that status increases perceived trustworthiness, and positively affects the trust premium for past trustworthy behavior.

These two possibilities are examined empirically using a panel dataset of U.S. county areas from 1982 to 2012 and a specification allowing for a potential non-linearity between development patterns and per capita expenditures.

Given the morphology and pattern of the lower leg lesions and the ecology of the disease, the authors conclude that mycetoma is the most likely explanation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:59:33.654564,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-14T20:07:36.361704,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/citation/,2vjxk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/48x9s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/relationships/node/,48x9s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5941974e9ad5a1004682ce7c/,5941974e9ad5a1004682ce7c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vjxk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2vjxk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2vjxk

Intergenerational differences in attitudes towards nonprofit organizations,"In this study, we analyze whether there are differences in attitudes towards nonprofit organizations (NPOs) between the generational cohorts of Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials. We do so by analyzing survey data from Switzerland in two steps, a Bayesian estimation as well as a cluster analysis. The overall results suggest that there are, at best, only few and small intergenerational differences: The only consistent effect we find are the more negative attitudes of the Baby Boomer cohort towards professional associations and towards sports NPOs, but those differences could be due to life cycle rather than intergenerational effects. Overall, our results suggest that the Millennial generational cohort is at least as interested in and willing to engage with NPOs as previous generational cohorts.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|babyboomers|generations|generation x|gen x|millennials|nonprofits|npos|values,2018-07-02T10:59:33.484213,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-14T09:22:02.024141,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/citation/,g8nqy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8rsd4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/relationships/node/,8rsd4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5940ffa89ad5a10046828b35/,5940ffa89ad5a10046828b35,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g8nqy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g8nqy/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11266-018-0025-8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g8nqy

To develop a theory of cover storying, insights are drawn from political sociologies of state secrecy and from recent sociological examinations of secrecy and deception in organisations. This theory is illustrated by analysing Cobra Mist, a secretive and deceptive Anglo-American Cold War intelligence operation. Examining recently declassified documents, this article develops a framework for the analysis of five interrelated narrative conditions that shape social processes of cover storying: correspondence; plausibility; accountability; constraint; and durability. In conclusion this article reflects on the broader implications of this analysis for contemporary state and organisational theories and understandings of secrecy.",TRUE,FALSE,Cold War|Cover Story|Deception|Government|Information Control|International Relations|Leak|Lying|Military Sociology|Organizations|Political Sociology|Secrecy,2018-07-02T10:59:33.290081,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-13T18:45:49.899206,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce4|Arts and Humanities|History|Military History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/citation/,kum6r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9s5jz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/relationships/node/,9s5jz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59402fcf9ad5a1022a097a81/,59402fcf9ad5a1022a097a81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kum6r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kum6r/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038516657949,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kum6r
