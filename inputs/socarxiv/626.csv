In Canada, finding and using historical census boundary data can be a little difficult. Statistics Canada makes tabular census data available online for the 2011, 2006, 2001, and 1996 Censuses, with some summary profile tables available back to 1991. For boundary files however, fewer censuses are accessible, with only 2011, 2006, and 2001 available online. Today, access to the older collections is typically mediated by Statistics Canada, or academic libraries who have access through the Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) program. Given that the data from these earlier years are not readily available online publically, it prevents researchers from easily accessing and using them. In addition, for some of the older censuses, the digital spatial data are stored in archaic data formats which present challenges for use in modern Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

In the fall of 2015, Scholars Portal and the University of Toronto Map and Data Library embarked on a project to bring together the dispersed collection of digital census geography datasets and make them available online so they can be easily accessed by researchers, students, and the general public. This project makes data and documentation available openly through the Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) Scholars GeoPortal platform (http://geo.scholarsportal.info). In making the collection available online openly and all in one place, these datasets will be shared and reused more effectively, thus reducing barriers and duplication for researchers everywhere.

This paper outlines the current status of census boundary datasets in Canada and then details our work which includes collecting known datasets from a variety of sources, data conversion, composing a comprehensive set of metadata, and providing online access to the collection. We also compiled an extensive inventory of all known boundaries produced in order to keep track of the collection as well as assess any gaps to help plan future digitization projects. We hope that this work is utilized and shared with others so that more attention is given to this important historical GIS collection.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|census|geography,2018-07-02T11:37:30.898382,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-02T19:22:22.296718,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,Jeff Allen,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/citation/,eacs5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z3dnv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/relationships/node/,z3dnv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a73949868ee49000d373820/,5a73949868ee49000d373820,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eacs5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eacs5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eacs5,NA

The other avenue is international relations scholarship in which race manifests itself through both commission (what is written and taught), and omission (what is left out, minimized and, indeed, silenced).

We analyze the response of international financial markets to the 2016 US presidential election. The surprise election outcome represents an exogenous shock that affords us a unique opportunity to estimate the effect of a partisan shift in the White House on third countries. Given Donald Trump's unanticipated victory and his promises of financial deregulation, investors revised their return expectations for third countries according to countries' exposure to the election shock. We argue that countries with dense financial ties to the US benefited from expectations of regulatory reform in Wall Street. We estimate the election effect on foreign equity markets using data on 134 single-country exchange-traded funds (ETFs) covering 48 developed and developing economies.

Social networks have many distinctive characteristics that demarcate them from SMS (Short Message Service), VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) and the ordinary voice phone call.
Early social networks prior to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Linkedin included MySpace and Xanga. MySpace which was founded in 2003 was early adaptor to the fundamental concepts we know today like networking, personal framing online and sharing that undermine every social interaction offline and online. Xanga pioneered the highly customizable profile which gave users the option to customize practically any element on their page by accessing the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) code of the visual elements they could modify to their own liking and personality, this however required a lot of programming skills and was a set back for the social network’s aim of customizability.
In our current state and time in the western world in academic, work and extracurricular activities nearly all of the members interacting are on one social network, if not all that are mentioned. Facebook serves as a social marketing tool for some of its users that frame their lives in a pseudo-happy frame and some let out their problems and grasp Facebook as a personal journal without the confidentiality of a paperback journal. Instagram is visually based social network that aims to extrovert one’s creative skills of being a smartphone photographer. Instagram includes tools that help your photography skills and even provide a toolbox of premade filters set to provide digitally taken photographs with an old-school visual of film photography. Linkedin lets business workers, owners, seekers and entrepreneurs connect to one another in a highly formal manner, something that isn’t found in Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
This research takes the social network Twitter as its content matter due to its significant uniqueness of not being a visually based social network that is prevalent today. Twitter has been known for its straight message transmissions from the sender to the receiver. On Twitter everyone can interact with everyone from celebrities and politicians to farmers and students. This research aims to answer the concept of correlations and trends between Twitter users and their social network scope. Being branded as the “social network for smarter people”, Twitter is relevant to the intellectual property that composes the electronic knowledge base. Twitter is a witty and smart social network; users have 140 characters or less to compose their message.

Scholars from various disciplinary perspectives have put forth theories of why homeland states engage with emigrant or coethnic populations, and why these populations seek to engage with the government of their homeland. What is missing in the literature is a theory of how such homeland-diaspora relationships come into being and how they change over time. Understanding the development of homeland-diaspora relationships is crucial for making sense of migrant transnationalism and of state sovereignty in a globalized era.  

This study addresses this gap in the literature through a historical and ethnographic study of the relationship between the Republic of China (ROC) and Chinese language schools in Los Angeles. The case of the ROC and the Chinese diaspora is an illuminating case because the anomalous nature of the ROC’s political status calls into question many of the main assumptions in the existing literature. In particular, it challenges the assumption that each diaspora corresponds to a sole, legitimated homeland state. 

In the Chinese case, the geopolitical divisions at the end of the Chinese Civil War resulted in two states: the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the Chinese mainland and the ROC on the island of Taiwan. While the communist PRC was not geopolitically legitimate in the West during the early part of the Cold War, widespread recognition of the PRC in the 1970s has left the ROC’s statehood claim in a liminal state. For the diaspora, this has resulted in two potential homeland states. 

The ROC’s de-legitimated claim to statehood has left it dependent on diaspora political support just as demographic shifts and transformations in the US social and political environment made it easier for the diaspora to support the PRC. I argue that the balance of power between the ROC diaspora bureau and the language schools have transformed since the Cold War as a result of domestic and geopolitical changes. The key factor shaping this relationship is the presence of the PRC and its changing geopolitical role since the 1980s. My explanation bridges theories of migrant transnationalism with theories of resource dependence among hierarchically linked organizations. This study contributes to the literatures on immigration, nationalism, and ethnicity, but also to broader literatures on borders and the reach of the state.",TRUE,FALSE,China|diaspora|nationalism|Taiwan,2018-07-02T11:37:26.555511,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-31T19:27:32.679295,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/citation/,23hg4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v7gph/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/relationships/node/,v7gph,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a7217226f849f000d4b9436/,5a7217226f849f000d4b9436,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23hg4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/23hg4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/23hg4,NA
