Exploring the tension between behaviorist/constructivist dichotomies and searching for common ground between the two schools of thought can give rise to alternative approaches.  A ‘Principled Eclectic Approach’ to language teaching is one way whereby a pluralism of methodologies is favored in the pursuit of more effective Second Language Acquisition.  Using Brown’s Post-Method Principles (2002) and Mellow’s Two Dimensional Model and Centring Principle (2002) as a guide and point of reference, teachers can gauge their approach and effectiveness in a more dynamic learning environment. A two-part research study aimed to introduce a more Principled Eclectic Approach to academic English language instruction in higher education.  Firstly, translation aimed to let students bring their mother tongue into the classroom.  The rationale for this exercise being that the more meaningful the encounter with the target language, the better the acquisition.  The second experiment looked to use music as a way to create a more relaxed learning environment during reading comprehension activities.  The premise being that we acquire language better when we are relaxed. Feedback from the study revealed that the content was balanced, coherent, met the needs of the learner and the needs of the wider syllabus.  Students were positive when taking part in the lessons as they believed that the methodologies tested helped them with their English acquisition.  Subsequently, they wanted further exposure to these methodologies.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-08T14:46:28.445175,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:46:00.800688,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/citation/,u5gsn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604591f551a4a600ce771492/,604591f551a4a600ce771492,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u5gsn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u5gsn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u5gsn

However, there is a dearth of use of PBL and its relevance in English Language Teaching (ELT). Thus, this exploratory study focusses on the use, relevance and implementation of PBL in ELT. It describes how PBL empowers English for Academic Purposes (EAP) learners by engaging them in real-world issues. The insights gained from self- classroom observations of the teacher-researcher were integrated with insights obtained through extensive literature review. This study was done over eight semesters with around 300 students in each semester. The study showed that in English for Business 1(an EAP course), PBL fosters self-directed learning as the students make choices and take decisions about current economic problems in accomplishing the various milestones of the process throughout the semester. It also showed that EAP learners can take charge of their learning and make their connections with authentic business material. The study further showed that the use of PBL approach in English for Business 1 course helped learners reﬂect on the way they had learnt, improved their research skills, gave the confidence to do teamwork, helped them identify relevant research tools and inculcated self-management and time management skills in them. The study, thus, showed that the use of PBL encourages active learning and makes EAP learners become responsible for their learning as they indulge in reflective critical thinking about what is being learned, which in turn makes them life-long learners. The study makes several recommendations for an effective PBL class, including allowing students to choose their groups, providing feedback at the right time, encouraging the use of reflective journals, etc.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-08T14:01:02.527619,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:00:34.169400,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/citation/,y8ga2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604590a451a4a600cd76fca2/,604590a451a4a600cd76fca2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8ga2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y8ga2/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y8ga2

The education technology field has rapidly embraced new tools and techniques to enhance the student learning experience. With the evolution of multimedia elements such as digital images, audio, video, graphics, and animation, the learning supported by technology has made learning flexible and accessible in terms of time and place. With Wi-Fi enabled campuses, it is much easier for students to learn using their smart devices enabled by hypermedia content. Hypermedia, also known as active media, is the multimedia content that brings in interactivity, where the user can interact with the system, rather than viewing the content in passive mode. This helps in generating a dialogue between the system and user, sustaining user interest. Some examples of hypermedia are interactive quizzes, games, interactive videos, etc. This study aims to investigate and evaluate four interactive tools, namely FluentU, Duolingo, Livemocha, and Hello English, which are designed for language learning. A qualitative assessment of the applications, including a review of past literature on language learning using tools, was undertaken. The expert evaluation or assessment was done using Jakob Nielsen’s ten heuristics or design guidelines. The objective was to compare the applications by measuring their usability against the standard heuristics. The goal of any usability study is user satisfaction.

Digitization of education helps us to find answers to how technology can enable teachers and students to access specialized materials outside the classroom, in various formats and ways that help to utilize both time and space. Educators all over the world are trying to overcome the limitations of being physically separated by moving onto online learning platforms. This paper attempts to find out the feasibility of using technology for teaching language to learners of English as a second language in the present-day context. The findings of this research are based on responses to a questionnaire answered by both the Language teachers and the Undergraduate students of Middle East College, Muscat and through literature review.  Gen Z, the ‘digital natives’ do not want teachers to be replaced entirely by computers as they need motivation, inspiration, and emotional support. Virtual education is feasible, but its success depends upon the effective content generation, designing and planning for its delivery, and the effective use of teaching/learning tools that can supplement the efforts of the teachers. For online teaching and learning not only do the colleges and educational institutions need to be well-equipped, the learners also need to adapt to the changing scenario.",TRUE,FALSE,asynchronous learning|digitization|Omani context|online learning platforms|teaching and learning tools|virtual education,2021-03-08T02:39:09.220072,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T02:38:43.678248,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/citation/,qa2rm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60458c296a10eb00af29fee7/,60458c296a10eb00af29fee7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qa2rm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qa2rm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qa2rm

They offer an appealing opportunity to access multiple sources of information anytime and anywhere. Students who join Dubai Men’s College in the Foundations program suffer from accumulative weakness in the language skills in general and in the listening skill in particular. The study aimed to confirm the positive impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on English Listening Skills. It attempted to examine the effect of MALL on students’ acquisition of English language Listening Skill at Dubai Men’s College (DBM), the United Arab Emirates. The study also investigated teachers’ perspectives on the effect of MALL on the students’ listening skill. The research question was: To what extent students’ listening skills have in the experimental group developed through the use of MALL compared to the students in the control group?  A mixed-method approach composed of qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis was used to answer this question. 66 students participated in a quasi-experiment of an experimental group, and a control group and 20 teachers participated. The findings indicated that there were statistically significant differences between both groups in favour of the experimental group. The research stressed the benefits of using MALL to improve the students’ listening skills, especially those who seem to be demotivated. Finally, some teachers showed a lot of support for the use of MALL. Additional empirical research should be conducted to increase the generalizability of the findings.",TRUE,FALSE,Dubai Men’s College|language acquisition|listening skill|MALL|teachers’ perspectives,2021-03-08T02:38:42.829820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T02:38:14.513115,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/citation/,6n2xp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60458b7151a4a600cd76ea47/,60458b7151a4a600cd76ea47,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6n2xp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6n2xp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6n2xp
