This work, however, ignores the complex multilevel structure between parties and governments: Many parties become nested in multiple governments over time, and governments are often nested in coalitions of multiple parties. In this paper, I show that this crisscrossing structure (i) induces dependencies among observations that inflate both Type-I and Type-II error rates when left unmodeled, and (ii) reflects an inherent aggregation problem in party-level explanations. I then advance a novel statistical technique – the generalized multiple membership multilevel model (MMMM) – to account for the dependencies among observations and to explicitly model the aggregation of party effects to the government level. By endogenizing the aggregation weights of a standard MMMM and aggregating both systematic and random effects, the technique allows to model and test interdependencies among parties in their effect on governments. I demonstrate the model’s ability to better integrate theoretical expectations into empirical models with a simulation and an empirical application to the survival of coalition governments as predicted by parties’ financial dependencies. The results show that the more parties’ financial resources comprise of contributions from their members, the higher the termination hazard of governments including those parties.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-28T18:42:00.956758,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-28T18:41:46.490664,FALSE,NA,no,Will be available before publication.,,no,Observational study,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/citation/,4bafr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbbe010def8eb0534e7a8ad/,5fbbe010def8eb0534e7a8ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bafr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4bafr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4bafr

The purpose of the study is to produce a portrait of media use in Canada, paying special attention to the typical population segments in the Canadian population differentiated by their media vehicles and sources of information about the pandemic. The study used as its data source a survey sample of 4,600 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the period of July 20-26 2020, and collected by Statistics Canada. Media user activities comprised a set of 11 dichotomous scales collecting data on main sources of information such as social media posts, online news, online magazines, video platforms, e-mails as well as non internet-based sources.  A market segmentation analysis of these scales using Principal Components and k-means cluster analysis revealed the presence of six major population segments: Social Media Buffs (27%), News Followers (33%), Unplugged (10%),Plugged-In (9%), E-Mailers (7%) and Mixed Source Users (16%). The segment mottos were as follows: ""Social Media Influencers Know Their Stuff!"", ""Track Those Headlines!"", ""I’ve Got My Own Info Sources About The Pandemic!"", ""Did You Read The Last Blog?"" ""My People Know Better!"" and ""Better Info Means More Choices!"". This study suggests that  media users in Canada constitute a very diverse group of individuals who are engaged in social and non social media to obtain timely information about the pandemic. However, they can also be exposed to inaccurate, misleading information about the virus, its transmission and its treatments. In this light, market segmentation may be  a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members by their typical attitudinal traits and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns directed at population segments, help design messages, and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with their target audiences.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|COVID-19 Pandemic|Marketing Segmentation,2020-11-24T06:45:03.106375,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-24T06:44:37.380495,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.fern2350.com/how-is-the-covid-19-pandemic-changing-the-lives-of-canadians.html,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,Fernando Mata,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/citation/,ax9vm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbbbe9d5502ac05248c66a0/,5fbbbe9d5502ac05248c66a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ax9vm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ax9vm

How the digital giant ensnares journalism.","The study describes how Google has funnelled more than 200 million euro in cash gifts to European media since 2013, while at the same time the company has resisted political efforts in Europe to force it to share advertising revenue with ailing publishing houses. Google’s first fund was created in France in 2013 to appease publishers calling for a “Google tax” on digital advertising. This provided a template for the future, as the study’s analysis of the origins of the Google News Initiative shows. The study describes how Google’s attention and gifts have transformed the relationship between the Silicon Valley company and German publishing houses. Findings are based on anonymised interviews with 25 German media executives and journalists covering digital media, a data analysis of 645 projects funded by Google’s Digital News Initiative (DNI) in Europe between 2015 and 2019, as well as a survey on the use of Google tools among German media houses. The research is flanked by an interview with two key figures in Google’s European news division and supported by an in-depth analysis of source material on origins of Google’s journalism initiative.

    Of Google’s giving to media between 2015 and 2019, the bulk of the money went to long-established Western European publishers. Commercial publishing businesses account for 70 percent of Google’s funding within the Digital News Initiative. Only 9 percent of funding went to non-profit and public service media companies, with other funds going to research institutions, individuals and non-journalistic media start-ups. The median founding date of funded organisations is 1996, which shows Google’s funding favours incumbent companies. (The company says funding decisions are made by experts and industry leaders on the board of its News Initiative, but it hand-picks who sits on that board.) While Google is not transparent about funding figures for media, the study is able to drawn on a data gathered from publishers and publicly available information.
    Interviews with publishing executives show that while most of them were sceptical of Google’s motives and several interviewees described the company’s funding as a PR exercise, the money was often spent on key innovation projects within publishing houses. “Well, we wouldn’t have done it otherwise, because we simply can’t afford it”, one manager told the authors.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-24T06:41:22.369030,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-24T06:41:04.277441,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.otto-brenner-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_data/stiftung/02_Wissenschaftsportal/02_Infoseiten/AH103/OnlineAnhang/2_DNI-Studie_Anhang-F_DNI-Projekte.xlsx|https://www.otto-brenner-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_data/stiftung/02_Wissenschaftsportal/02_Infoseiten/AH103/OnlineAnhang/4_DN-Studie_Anhang-B_Google-Interview.pdf|https://www.otto-brenner-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_data/stiftung/02_Wissenschaftsportal/02_Infoseiten/AH103/OnlineAnhang/4_DN-Studie_Anhang-A_Google-eMails.pdf,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/citation/,3qbp9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbb9247def8eb0502e759cf/,5fbb9247def8eb0502e759cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qbp9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3qbp9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3qbp9

The media have an important role in influencing recipients’ behaviour by promoting reassurance or anxiety on this issue. This study examines how food supply and demand, in the context of Brexit, has been portrayed by the British media.
Methods: A mixed methods content analysis of articles reporting on food supply and demand in the context of Brexit, in three daily newspapers, between 01 January 2015 and 31 January 2020.
Results: Five themes emerged: food shortages and panic buying (appearing in 96% of articles); food supply chain disruption (86%); economic impacts of Brexit (80%); preparation and stockpiling by the government and food sector (63%) and preparation and stockpiling by individuals (22%).
Conclusion: Government messaging reported by the media sought to reassure the public that there will be no food shortages under a no-deal Brexit. These reassurances contradicted warnings from the food sector and leaked government reports of reduced availability of food items. These contradictory messages may have undermined trust in the government, potentially influencing stockpiling behaviour at the individual level.",TRUE,FALSE,Brexit|food panic buying|Food shortages|food stockpiling|mixed methods content analysis,2020-11-24T06:40:22.558335,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-24T06:40:04.181138,FALSE,NA,no,Data is a media analysis of daily UK newspapers which were accessed from the electronic archive of Nexis UK database (www.nexis.com),,no,As this is a mixed methods analysis preregistration was not deemed necessary,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/citation/,vfqhn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbb8363def8eb04fde74218/,5fbb8363def8eb04fde74218,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vfqhn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vfqhn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vfqhn

Shaping this environment effectively is not the same as causing changes or making differences, but is similar to swimming efficiently in this river. The most powerful currents in this river are related to climate, demographic, technological and economic changes, great power relations, big catastrophes, and human dynamics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have the largest impact on the strategic environment in the short to medium term. Although the directions of many changes brought about by the global plague are still unfathomable as the pandemic continues to unfold, four trends accelerated by the pandemic—the growth in importance of the cyber domain, the bifurcation of the world economy, the intensification of great power competition, and the transformation of international architecture—are constituting the shape of things to come. In the medium to long term, the hegemonic contest between China and the United States will have the largest impact on the strategic environment. Metaphorically speaking, it is creating the largest vortex in the river that is the strategic environment. East Asia and Australia will be drawn into this vortex even against the best effort to stay outside. This chapter argues that, contrary to the belief of many, there is no Thucydides Trap—the structural cause of war—in this hegemonic contest because it is structured as a game of chicken, not a prisoner’s dilemma. It is important for any player in this environment to recognize the strategic structure of the US-PRC hegemonic contest and apply the best strategy for it as suggested by this structure. China has masterfully played the game of chicken with its gray zone tactics, its pursuit of ‘war by other means’, i.e., its weaponization of the non-military, even of risks. The US-PRC hegemonic contest will not resemble the Cold War much beyond this strategic structure. It will be very different from the Cold War in important aspects, including the ideological and economic realm. Most strikingly, the main front lines of the contest will be in the maritime and cyber domains and, consequently, will be far more fluid and unstable than those of the Cold War.",TRUE,FALSE,chicken game|game theory|geopolitical landscape|great power competition|indo-pacific|new Cold War|post-COVID world|prisoner's dilemma|strategic environment|US-Australia alliance|US-China rivalry,2020-11-23T05:08:00.734969,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-23T05:07:36.233551,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/citation/,xbtq6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbb3178def8eb04d9e7c08b/,5fbb3178def8eb04d9e7c08b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbtq6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbtq6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbtq6

This essay mines the past for lessons about great power competition by examining the structural impact of these factors on the rise and fall of great powers, the balance of power among them, and the character of their relations. 
In order to aid its analysis, the essay introduces three concepts that have not been discussed in the literature: 
1) The system-changers: actors that are not system-makers like the great powers but have the power to change the international system and disrupt the balance of power among the system-makers.
2) The strategic structure of great power competition: a structure that emerges from the interaction of the players’ preferences and determines the best strategies for the players as well as the stable outcomes of their game. The essay argues that the Thucydides Trap does not exist in the US-China rivalry because the strategic structure of this rivalry is that of either a Game of Chicken or a Peace-lover’s Dilemma. Using game theory and geopolitics, the essay is able to make long-term predictions and strategy implications for the US-China rivalry.
3) The peace-lover’s dilemma: an asymmetric game whose stable outcome is the dominance of the more aggressive player (who prefers its own supremacy to sharing power with the other) over the less aggressive player (who prefers sharing power with the other to its own supremacy), hence this is a dilemma for the game’s peace-loving player.",TRUE,FALSE,chicken game|game theory|geopolitics|great power competition|peace-lover's dilemma|prisoner's dilemma|rimland theory|strategic structure|thucydides trap,2020-11-23T05:06:40.614572,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-23T05:06:32.034305,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/citation/,dmvbw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbb2e4a77aa6504af9513ab/,5fbb2e4a77aa6504af9513ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dmvbw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dmvbw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dmvbw

To this end, the paper will answer three central questions: What is soft power? Where does soft power come from? How does soft power works?
Answering these questions requires fundamentally a global and systematic mapping of the power behaviors. This paper maps the power behaviors by identifying the basic ways of power, which include a hard way and a soft way of power-over and a hard way and a soft way of power-with. Soft power results from the soft way of power-with. The assets that give rise to soft power are positive agential qualities, not intangible resources as many assume. These positive agential qualities include not just kindness but also competence and commitment. This paper outlines the process that generates soft power and sheds light on the causal mechanisms, both at the behavioral and the psychological levels, through which soft power works.
The paper benefits greatly from research in multiple disciplines, including biology, psychology, economics, anthropology, sociology, and political science. It involves substantially and links together various phenomena discussed in different fields of study: signaling, indirect reciprocity, generalized exchange, prestige, status, and leadership. With the integration of these phenomena into a theory of soft power, the paper is able to provide a better explanation of indirect reciprocity, a more comprehensive explanation of the strategic logic of prestige-seeking, and a deeper explanation of charisma, among others.",TRUE,FALSE,attraction|charismatic leadership|generalized exchange|indirect reciprocity|leadership|power with|prestige|reciprocity|social exchange|soft power,2020-11-23T05:06:01.856792,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-23T05:05:50.130015,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Alexander Vuving,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/citation/,2v6h9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbb259d77aa6504a8950642/,5fbb259d77aa6504a8950642,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v6h9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2v6h9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2v6h9

In this paper we outline how crop yield models can be combined with the historical and archaeological information about past societies compiled by Seshat: Global History Database to infer how agricultural productivity and potential have changed over time in different parts of the world. To aid comparative research we focus on developing a method for calculating the carrying capacity of a particular region based on a number of simplifying assumptions. Here we present two case studies demonstrating the calculation of ancient crop yields and carrying capacity for the regions of Latium (Italy) and Oaxaca (Mexico); regions selected to illustrate a number of different features of past agricultural systems, as well as different staple crops. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and discuss ways in which it could be adapted to address a range of research questions, e.g. relating to archaeological demography and anthropogenic change.  Comparison of our reconstructed carrying capacity series with independent estimates of ancient population from these regions demonstrate broadly good agreement with some notable mismatches as well, highlighting a fruitful area of focus for future studies exploring the gap between achieved population and potential carrying capacity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-22T22:14:02.104258,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-22T22:13:35.184015,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/citation/,ky9wt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbac1ea5502ac04b48c46ac/,5fbac1ea5502ac04b48c46ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9wt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ky9wt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ky9wt
