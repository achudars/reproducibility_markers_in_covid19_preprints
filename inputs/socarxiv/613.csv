Neighbourhood context and trust in the police in Northern Ireland,"The association between trust in the police and neighbourhood-level factors such as deprivation, disorder and social cohesion is well established. As an embodiment of the effort to reproduce normative social order, the police garner trust when community settings are perceived as orderly, cohesive and well-functioning.  Conversely, trust is undermined when order and cohesion seem attenuated or under threat. Yet, little attention has been paid to the association between neighbourhood diversity and trust in the police. Allport’s contact hypothesis suggests that because diversity increases intergroup contact and thus a sense of cohesion, it may promote trust in the police. In this paper we use data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2014, combined with Census and other local-area data, to explore the association between ethno-religious diversity and trust in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. We find that trust is higher in more diverse areas, primarily because Catholics living in such areas report significantly higher levels of trust than their counterparts living in less diverse areas. We interpret these results in light of what policing means in contemporary Northern Ireland and consider the implications for attempts to enhance police-community trust in segregated and divided societies more generally.",TRUE,FALSE,collective efficacy|ethnic diversity|Northern lreland|policing|trust,2018-07-02T11:05:23.207191,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-26T16:14:22.317812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/citation/,7546d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/42ndv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/relationships/node/,42ndv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5978bf3bb83f69022931c8c5/,5978bf3bb83f69022931c8c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7546d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7546d,NA

The focus of the current study is on the notion of bounded authority – i.e. acting within the limits of one’s rightful authority.  According to work on legal socialization, US citizens come to acquire three dimensions of values that determine how authorities ought to behave: (a) neutral, consistent and transparent decision-making; (b) interpersonal treatment that conveys respect, dignity and concern; and (c) respecting the limits of one’s rightful power. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of US adults, we show that concerns over bounded authority, respectful treatment, and neutral decision-making combine to form a strong predictor of police and legal legitimacy. We also find that legal legitimacy is associated with greater compliance behavior, controlling for personal morality and perceived likelihood of sanctions. We discuss the implications of a boundary perspective with respect to ongoing debates over the appropriate scope of police power and the utility of concentrated police activities.  We also highlight the need for further research specifically focused on the psychological mechanisms underlying the formation of boundaries and why they shape the legitimacy of the police and law.",TRUE,FALSE,Compliance|Legal socialization|Legitimacy|Policing by consent|Procedural justice|Public contact with the police|Trust,2018-07-02T11:05:23.143388,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-26T15:46:44.086824,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/citation/,nezm6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/27x89/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/relationships/node/,27x89,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5978b8736c613b022938c52f/,5978b8736c613b022938c52f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nezm6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nezm6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nezm6,NA

While the Axial Age concept is well-known and influential, deficiencies in the historical evidence and sociological analysis available have thwarted efforts to evaluate the Axial Age concept’s major global contentions. As a result, the Axial Age concept remains controversial. Seshat: Global History Databank provides new tools for examining this topic in social formations across Afro-Eurasia during the first two millennia BCE and first millennium CE, allowing scholars to empirically evaluate the many varied— and contrasting—claims put forward about this period. Our systematic investigation undercuts the notion of a specific 'age' of axiality limited to a specific geo-temporal localization. Critical traits offered as evidence of an axial transformation by proponents of the Axial Age concept are shown to have appeared across Afro-Eurasia hundreds and in some cases thousands of years prior to the proposed Axial Age.

Key to the theory are two points: (a) that “common knowledge” lies may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling; and (b) that when a political system is suffering from a “crisis of legitimacy” (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency, members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests. Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is perceived, and that several oft-discussed factors—information-access, culture, language, and gender—are not necessary for explaining such differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal, it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political system as flawed or illegitimate.",TRUE,FALSE,Authenticity|Demagogue|Elections|Lying|Political Sociology|Presidential Politics,2018-07-02T11:05:22.413672,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-25T16:06:27.771713,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Oliver Hahl|Minjae Kim|Ezra W.

We conducted a résumé audit study to examine the effect of social class signals on entry into large U.S. law firms. We sent applications from fictitious students at selective but non-elite law schools to 316 law firm offices in 14 cities, randomly assigning signals of social class background and gender to otherwise identical résumés. Higher-class male applicants received significantly more callbacks than did higher-class women, lower-class women, and lower-class men. A survey experiment and interviews with lawyers at large firms suggest that, relative to lower-class applicants, higher-class candidates are seen as better fits with the elite culture and clientele of large law firms. But, although higher-class men receive a corresponding overall boost in evaluations, higher-class women do not, because they face a competing, negative stereotype that portrays them as less committed to full-time, intensive careers. This commitment penalty faced by higher-class women offsets class-based advantages these applicants may receive in evaluations.

states. One résumé in each pair was randomly assigned experience in a gay campus organization,
and the other résumé was assigned a control organization. Two main findings have emerged.
First, in some but not all states, there was significant discrimination against the fictitious
applicants who appeared to be gay. This geographic variation in the level of discrimination
appears to reflect regional differences in attitudes and anti-discrimination laws. Second,
employers who emphasized the importance of stereotypically male heterosexual traits were
particularly likely to discriminate against openly gay men. Beyond these particular findings, this
study advances the audit literature more generally by covering multiple regions and by

I find that religiosity is clearly gendered, but in different ways for women and men. Consistent with the feminine-typing of religion in the Christian-majority context of the United States, gender expression is linked with more religiousness among women but not men. Consistent with religion being a sometimes patriarchal institution, those with more pride in being men are more religious.

Contrary to the standard assumption that income is proportional to productivity, I hypothesize that income is most strongly determined by social power, 	as indicated by one's  position within an institutional hierarchy.  While many theorists have proposed a connection between personal income and power, this paper is the first to quantify this relation. I propose that  power can be quantified in terms of the number of subordinates below one's position in a hierarchy. Using this definition, I find that relative income within firms scales strongly with hierarchical power.  I also find that hierarchical power has a stronger effect on income than any other factor for which data is available.  I conclude that this is evidence for a power theory of personal income distribution.",TRUE,FALSE,hierarchy|income distribution|income inequality|power,2018-07-02T11:03:35.164123,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-23T14:38:33.297394,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/citation/,qgwus,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/98zcj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/relationships/node/,98zcj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5974b3666c613b0229379bd2/,5974b3666c613b0229379bd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgwus/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgwus/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgwus,NA

In this sense, it explores the world of Arab women and investigates aspects of taboos surrounding their issues and language use. In other terms, the focal point of this paper is centered on the linguistic devices that females employ to express taboos. This paper also evaluates women’s discourse and the reasons that keep their lives surrounded by mystery and ambiguity. Hence, Arab females’ issues and language are investigated in the light of the stereotypes Westerners have about the Islamic religious beliefs. Our study further explores the lexicon related to females’ topics like virginity, menstruation, menopause and their body parts. To this vein, a thorough examination was made depending on the informants’ gender, age and their sociocultural background with the support of a structured questionnaire, a focus group interview and participant observation. The findings demonstrate that Algerian females’ issues are directed by the cultural norms of their society. The results also reveal that speakers resort to euphemistic strategies to speak about women’s private lives, although Algerian dialects are rich in euphemistic expressions related to females’ sensitive issues.",TRUE,FALSE,Algerian society|females’ tabooed issues|social norms|taboos,2018-07-02T11:03:34.995512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:49:11.535682,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/citation/,zrypx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/24vnm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/relationships/node/,24vnm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972d8b89ad5a1023a564112/,5972d8b89ad5a1023a564112,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrypx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zrypx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zrypx,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.29

The hypothesis is, and based on previous studies of discourse markers by English learners, Saudi English learners overuse them. English essays are collected as a corpus for analysis and a concordance program is used to shed light on how frequently key words in contexts are used by learners. The study compares between Saudi learners and native speakers in their use of discourse markers and to investigate similarities and differences between the two groups. The results support previous studies as the analysis proves that Saudi learners overuse discourse markers. They have been used unnecessarily and redundantly. The preference of types of discourse markers has been investigated to show that learners use listing and resultive discourse markers mainly. The frequency count of the discourse markers in the collected corpus indicates their preference to vary specific types to avoid repetition and not to vary the semantic functions of discourse markers..",TRUE,FALSE,corpus|discourse markers|EFL learners|frequency count,2018-07-02T11:03:34.961296,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:45:42.783625,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/citation/,jfwc9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5yzpg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/relationships/node/,5yzpg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972d7f4b83f690228300e91/,5972d7f4b83f690228300e91,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfwc9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jfwc9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jfwc9,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.28
