How democracy works depends to a large degree on what democracy is framed as meaning, both in terms of the specific institutional arrangements that texts authorize and the disputed frames that are in play. The changing terrain of movements today may have less to do with the scale or locus of material power than with unresolved issues of democracy raised by movements of the past.  Although “democracy” is defined as the power of people, the question still arises, “which people”? The institutionalization of procedural democracy often went hand-in-hand with the exclusion of certain kinds of issues and constituents from institutional access to politics in specific ways in different countries.  Movements and parties are not just related to each other; both are sited in a broader field of political discourse. Feminist movements and bringing gender into evaluation of the democracy of democratic institutions illustrate this general claim, as the representation of both the people and the issues once defined as private have been transformed into legitimate matters of public political struggle.",TRUE,FALSE,democracy|discourse|gender politics|social inclusion|social movements,2020-02-26T04:30:59.628946,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T04:30:15.224485,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/citation/,fj35s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e53fd3e35d22d01ad5f30ab/,5e53fd3e35d22d01ad5f30ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj35s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fj35s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fj35s,NA

Liberal democracies, once revolutionarily new political formations, rested on an equally revolutionary understanding of male domination based not on descent but economic arrangements (the new “breadwinner” role) and political institutions (the “brotherhood” national state).  Over time, social movements have diminished liberal democracy’s original exclusions of women and nonwhite men so that many citizens’ daily lives now contradict this once hegemonic normative order. The U.S. party binary pushes contemporary movements for transforming or restoring this understanding of democracy under the political umbrellas of the competing Democratic and Republican parties. This polarization then contributes to the gendering of movement claims and political representation.

This paper argues instead for an understanding of liberal democracy itself as gendered, being the collective masculinity of brotherhoods representing rivalrous nations. The first great transition from patriarchies and monarchies to brotherhoods and democracies is not being unmade now but facing a second transition to a different understanding of gender and power. This normative rise of a partnership model in families and politics is incomplete and highly contested everywhere. In the U.S., it has become a partisan conflict expressed in gender terms. The Republican defense of the brotherhood state and its exclusive version of national good is countered by a newer but increasingly institutionalized vision of democracies as representing women and men equally.  By more explicitly de-masculinizing family headship and political leadership, social justice movements and the Democratic Party symbolically resist the restoration of gender norms privileging breadwinners and brotherhoods.",TRUE,FALSE,brotherhoods|democracy|gender politics|masculinity|partisanship|states|Trump,2020-02-26T04:26:43.494314,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T04:26:24.991034,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/citation/,68tmw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e53f51f8d876501a181325b/,5e53f51f8d876501a181325b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68tmw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/68tmw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/68tmw,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12599

The SDG4 is even more important for developing nations as receiving proper education or vocational training, especially in science and technology, means a foundational step in improving other aspects of their citizens’ lives. However, the extant scientific literature about STEM education still lacks focus on developing countries, even more so in the rural area. Using a dataset of 4967 observations of junior high school students from a rural area in a transition economy, the article employs the Bayesian approach to identify the interaction between gender, socioeconomic status, and students’ STEM academic achievements. The results report gender has little association with STEM academic achievements; however, female students (αa_Sex[2] = 2.83) appear to have achieved better results than their male counterparts (αa_Sex[1] = 2.68). Families with better economic status, parents with a high level of education (βb(EduMot) = 0.07), or non-manual jobs (αa_SexPJ[4] = 3.25) are found to be correlated with better study results. On the contrary, students with zero (βb(OnlyChi) = -0.14) or more than two siblings (βb(NumberofChi) = -0.01) are correlated with lower study results compared to those with only one sibling. These results imply the importance of providing women with opportunities for better education.

The contestation of scientific knowledge claims is reason to take a break from our every-day tasks as scientists and to reflect upon our doing as professional truth-seekers. This essay reviews two recent books on foundational and practical questions on the scholarly generation of knowledge. 'Why Trust Science' (Oreskes) is an intellectual expedition into the epistemological foundations of science. 'Transparent and Reproducible Social Science Research' (Christensen, Freese, Miguel) is the first book-length primer on contemporary Open Science debates in the social sciences. Together, these books demonstrate the range of what we can learn from the new wave of ‘research on research’, both as curious citizens and as academic scholars.",TRUE,FALSE,Book review|Meta-science|Open Science|Pre-registration|publication bias|Social Science,2020-02-20T14:17:24.750201,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-20T14:17:03.539201,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/citation/,7fmt9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4e82a4b8c2e501e84c5cbf/,5e4e82a4b8c2e501e84c5cbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fmt9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7fmt9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7fmt9,NA

Organizations like the Humanists society of Northern Nigeria, Atheist Society of Nigeria are spearheading social media campaigns within networks of Northern Nigerians. This Paper investigates the nature of the religious response to such cyberactivsim on social media, particularly Facebook.  Using data from social media feeds, we look at the measures being taken by believers to counter humanist campaigns. Our findings suggests that the  religious argument is undergoing a transformation with  an emphasis towards monotheism as a bridge between different religious frames.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital Culture|Frame Alignment|Northern Nigeria|Social Media,2020-02-20T14:19:06.052194,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-20T14:18:28.013242,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/citation/,vs586,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/egmbz/,egmbz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4e64c41949df01bd5651a2/,5e4e64c41949df01bd5651a2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs586/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vs586/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vs586,NA
