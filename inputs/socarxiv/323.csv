Such coverage is not only conveyed by the media and newspaper articles, but also by creating novels. As a result, the current study focuses on the concept of extremism. The hallmark of this study is to illustrate how such concept is ideologically embedded within a text. Thus, this study is confined to Don DeLillo's Falling man (2007). In this novel, DeLillo describes the trauma caused by 9/11 attacks. It is important to note that he  recruits his language to mirror Islam as an extreme religion.  To access the concept of extremism in this novel, the researchers will apply a critical stylistic approach. Therefore, the analysis will  depend heavily on the textual conceptual model that is represented by Jeffries (2010) to uncover the hidden ideologies related to extremism. The aims of current study is to investigate the way the linguistic meaning is used as a vehicle for constructing the ideology of extremism in the selected novel; in addition to identify the textual meaning that underlies extremism in the selected novel.  With the aid of critical stylistic tools, the researchers find out that DeLillo employs the use of certain linguistic choices in his novel. These choices tackle the concept of extremism focusing on the violent attitude behind such a concept with an attempt to link this concept to Islam and Muslims.",TRUE,FALSE,9/11 attacks|critical stylistics|extremism|Islam &amp; Muslims|terrorism,2019-09-04T02:42:06.000895,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:41:41.912097,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/citation/,u2awp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6edf2c536cf5001888863b/,5d6edf2c536cf5001888863b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2awp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2awp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2awp

Therefore, this study investigates the translation of Arabic verbal emphasis category and its subcategories into English from semantic and pragmatic perspectives. It draws upon an examination of several translations of these emphatic devices and structures into English. Specifically, it draws upon the translations of Naguib Mahfouz’s novels The Thief and the Dogs (1961), Children of Gebalawi (1988) and the Harafish (2013) and Ghassan Kanafani’s short stories Palestine’s Children (2000). The study highlights the erroneous strategies adopted by the translators of these literary works and suggests more suitable alternative translations. As a result of several mismatches between Arabic and English leads to such errors. This study attempts to handle a gape in literature and help translators to overcome the obstacles they may face in rendering such Arabic structures in English.

As far as pragmatics is concerned, it means an important means of communication within a context, and it is a culture dependent. As for silence in literature, it offers the example in which silence is not only present and comprehended but also a substantial part of communication that encapsulate a sender and a receiver. In novels, it is considered as a new humanistic tactic through which a writer would force the reader to feel words rather than reading them plus more intensity and strength. Novelists tend to use silence in writing their novels as it is an integral part of voices and a revelation of so many hidden things, but it mistakenly might be understood as a refusal for communication. Finally, the notion of ‘silence’ in poetry offers the readers many examples where the poet invites the readers to hear ""silence.""

The study addresses the following research questions: what are the linguistic, social-cultural, mistrust and communication-related barriers that are encountered by interpreters and language assistants in conflict zones, how do they cope with these challenges, and what could be done to train them to handle such challenges and difficulties. The study adopted a qualitative methodology with semi-structured interviews being the main method of data collection. Twenty participants agreed to voluntarily take part in the investigation by allowing face-to-face interviews. Interview data was transcribed, coded and analyzed thematically. The results of data analysis showed that participants faced a range of challenges that negatively affected their job. They reported difficulties understanding and dealing with some social and cultural issues specific to the region. They also reported some serious life-threatening incidents ranging from physical and verbal attacks. For example, interpreters encountered hostilities from their fellow citizens accusing them of siding with enemy parties involved in the conflicts. Additionally, communication barriers were reported by participants as being the most salient challenge they experienced even when they interpreted accurately, as they would still encounter communication breakdowns caused by the inherent differences in the indigenous languages and varieties in addition to some cultural barriers.

Bucke and Schleiermacher cited three forms of consciousness: Animal or Brutish Self-awareness, Sensual or Self-Consciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness. While examining the poetry of indigenous people, Palestinians and Native Americans, we find out that the majority moves within the confines of the Sensual or Self-Consciousness in their reaction to the brutish consciousness of the oppressors who deny their unalienable rights for life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Unlike others, Mahmoud Darwish, the Palestinian, and Joy Harjo, the Native American, attempt to transcend the sensual consciousness and adopt a broader universal vision or cosmic consciousness; however, their peaceful vision is often shattered by bitter realities and frustrated by the inhuman conduct of their oppressors.

Moreover, the question of the translator as cross-cultural mediator capable of achieving acculturation is addressed. The analysis is conducted following two fundamental concepts in the field of translation studies, namely domestication and foreignization, in addition to another view commonly used by the French philosopher Michel Foucault ""authority or power of language""  which arises through the discourses that we produce, or that others produce.

This study gives evidence that trust in government organisations diminishes in an environment of high inequality. With the introduction of a subjective measure of how individuals perceive income inequality, past limitations in quantifying the underlying mechanism between inequality and trust are addressed. A significant negative association between perceived inequality and trust in political institutions, like the government and the EU, is found using a sample of 27 European countries.

In the world of fusion power development, in November 2018, a U.S. National Academies’ report on US fusion research recommended a national ‘burning plasma’ fusion power facility but also emphasized the private sector’s role in fusion innovation. In the same month, the Fusion Industry Association publicly announced its launch, indicating a level of private-sector industry maturity. Multiple FIA members boldly aim to accelerate fusion’s commercial deployment to approximately one decade, yet none are fully funded to overcome the ‘valley of death’ innovation-to-commercialization obstacle. Nonetheless, introducing fusion power (a ‘Future Fusion Economy’) in a 2030-2040 timeframe could contribute substantially towards transitioning from fossil fuels within this century and thereby contribute significantly to addressing climate change in the post-Paris Agreement period. This article applies the Quadruple and Quintuple Innovation Helix Ecosystem framework to this problem. We consider how Global South funding for entrepreneurship and innovation, via petrostates’ sovereign wealth funds, can accelerate the development and commercialization of fusion, through funding continuous innovation operations. We advocate a multi-sectoral and multilateral approach to accelerate fusion innovation, increase global quality of democracy, and protect the natural environment, via a managed co-opetive global solution like the IEA’s commission.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|fusion|Global South|private sector|Quintuple Innovation Helix|super wicked problem,2019-09-04T19:52:22.025361,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T19:52:13.915633,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/citation/,axb95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n3jvx/,n3jvx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ea8b380f9b5001666af89/,5d6ea8b380f9b5001666af89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/axb95/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/axb95

Los resultados muestran una alta variabilidad entre los participantes, y cuyas evaluaciones fueron más coherentes en los mensajes que fueron clasificados como menos grave y más grave, respectivamente.

However, language mapping and geographic information system (GIS) data creation has not kept pace with this demand. To date, language range information is typically contained in small, private regional datasets, paper maps and published illustrations, or in a very small number of global digital datasets. Each of these sources has advantages and disadvantages, and though these considerations may not be apparent to all data users, they can have significant impacts on research results. Mapping of language ranges is a particularly complex problem in regions where colonial histories have had dramatic effects on language diversity, language locations, and the relative representation of colonial and indigenous perspectives. Here we consider how the creation of digital language range data can better meet the needs of researchers interested in language diversity, discuss how better standards for data quality and transparency can be implemented for digital language range maps, and present a map of North American language ranges that has resulted from the use of these procedures and standards.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-04T02:53:46.091253,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:53:24.099674,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/citation/,9fu7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6e2afc7215100019a0fccd/,5d6e2afc7215100019a0fccd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9fu7g/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9fu7g
