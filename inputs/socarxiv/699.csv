To develop a theory of cover storying, insights are drawn from political sociologies of state secrecy and from recent sociological examinations of secrecy and deception in organisations. This theory is illustrated by analysing Cobra Mist, a secretive and deceptive Anglo-American Cold War intelligence operation. Examining recently declassified documents, this article develops a framework for the analysis of five interrelated narrative conditions that shape social processes of cover storying: correspondence; plausibility; accountability; constraint; and durability.

We know little about institutions that persist despite such change conditions. Recent advances in sociological field theory suggest that inter-field ties contribute to institutional change but ignore how such ties may reinforce institutions. Extending both approaches, I integrate self-reinforcing mechanisms from path-dependence scholarship into field theory. I elucidate my framework with an analysis of the student-edited, student-reviewed law review. Despite sustained criticisms from those who publish in them and despite its anomalous position relative to the dominant peer-reviewed journal practices of other disciplines, the student-edited law review remains a bedrock institution of law schools and legal scholarship. My analysis covers the law review’s entire institutional history, from prior to the first law review’s emergence in 1875 to its current state. I combine qualitative historical analyses of law reviews and legal scholarship with quantitative analyses of law-review structures and field contestation. I argue that self-reinforcing mechanisms evident in law review’s ties to related fields – legal practice, law schools, the university, and legal journals – have buffered it against change.",TRUE,FALSE,academic publishing|field theory|institutional change|institutional stability|institutional theory|institutions|inter-field relations|law and society|law reviews|law schools|legal education|legal history|legal profession|legal scholarship|neoinstitutional theory|organizational sociology|organizational theory|organizations|path dependence|peer review|self-reinforcing mechanisms|sociological theory,2018-07-02T10:59:33.256565,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-13T18:06:01.037845,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2c|Law|Legal Education|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/citation/,wcq8y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594025f7b83f69022b434c88/,594025f7b83f69022b434c88,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcq8y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wcq8y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wcq8y,https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12393

Cultural theory is also one of the few strands of modern theorizing that boasts having a “straight line” of succession stemming from the programmatic concerns that preoccupied the sociological classics. Cultural theory carries this status in spite of the fact that its central concept is a 20th century anthropological importation made prominent in Parsons’s functionalism. This an odd situation because culture seems to be an inherently functionalist concept, and yet functionalism is the theory that is accused of providing a misleading interpretation of the classics and, accordingly, the theory that contemporary “cultural” approaches use to define themselves against. In this chapter I argue that, in spite of the aforementioned pretensions, there is no straightforward conceptual link between modern cultural analysis and the work of the classics, precisely because the contention that the classics were budding cultural theorists is a convenient invention of functionalism in the first place. I close by suggesting that the “problems” of contemporary cultural theory, being problems inherited from functionalism, may only be soluble by abandoning the culture concept.

This is an approach that promises to open up new vistas in our conceptualization of the relationship between social position and cultural taste, but which so far lacks operational grounding. In this paper, I draw on Breiger’s (1974) formalization of the idea of the duality of persons and groups along with classical formalizations of brokerage for sociometric networks (Burt 1992) to suggest that the “cultural ego network” of a typical survey respondent can be reconstructed from patterns of audience overlap among the cultural items that are chosen by each respondent. This leads to a formalization of the notion of omnivorousness as relatively low levels of clustering in the cultural network: namely, omnivorousness as cultural network efficiency. I show how this metric overcomes the difficulties that have plagued previous attempts to produce ordinal indicators of omnivorousness from simple counts of the number of cultural choices, while providing novel substantive (and sometime counter-intuitive) insights into the relationship between socio-demographic status markers and patterns of cultural choice in the contemporary United States.",TRUE,FALSE,Affiliation networks|Arts participation|Cultural capital|Cultural holes|Cultural stratification|Measurement|Omnivorousness,2018-07-02T10:59:32.284029,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-11T19:32:00.303196,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/citation/,x9r3c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xuzmh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/relationships/node/,xuzmh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593d99e7b83f690233314d26/,593d99e7b83f690233314d26,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9r3c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x9r3c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x9r3c,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-014-9220-9

Yet, given that the term “cognitive” has a variety of meanings, the question of where Bourdieu’s project of cognitive sociology fits into other cognitively grounded approaches in the social sciences remains open. In this chapter, I argue that if Bourdieu is to be considered a cognitive theorist, then there is only one way in which we can interpret his conception of cognition, and that is as a form of embodied cognition. I distinguish different senses of the term embodiment and specify how they show up in Bourdieu’s work. I discuss two broad sets of empirical phenomena---the “hard” and “soft” embodiment of culture---that have recently been identified and argue that their discovery represents a vindication of the prescience and extant promise of Bourdieu’s version of cognitive sociology.

The global network of alternative knowledge production and mobilization,"Since the 1970s, transnational alternative policy groups (TAPGs) have emerged as a component of global civil society, generating visions and strategies for a ‘globalization from below’ that points toward post-capitalist alternatives. This study proceeds from a neo-Gramscian understanding that hegemonic think tanks and TAPGs are embedded in opposing historical blocs, as they develop and deploy knowledge with the intent to make their respective blocs more coherent and effective. Here, we map the global network of TAPGs and kindred international groups – alternative media, social movement organizations, and international NGOs – in order to discern more specifically how TAPGs are embedded in a larger formation. In this era of capitalist globalization, are TAPGs, like their hegemonic counterparts, positioned as ‘brokers’, bridging across geographic spaces (e.g. North-South) and movement domains to foster the convergence across difference that is taken as a criterial attribute of a counter-hegemonic historical bloc? Our network analysis suggests that transnational alternative policy groups are well placed to participate in the transformation of the democratic globalization network from a gelatinous and unselfconscious state, into an historical bloc capable of collective action toward an alternative global order. However, this general finding must be qualified in two respects. On the one hand, there are gaps in the bloc, having to do with the representation and integration of regions and movement domains, and with the salience of post-capitalism as a unifying social vision. On the other hand, our architectonic network analysis does not reveal what the various relations and mediations in which TAPGs are active agents actually mean in concrete practice. There is a need both for closer analysis of the specific kinds of relations that link transnational alternative policy groups to other international actors, including intergovernmental organizations and funding foundations, and for field work that explores the actual practices of these groups, in situ.",TRUE,FALSE,Counter-hegemonic bloc|North-South ties|Social movements|Social network analysis|Transnational networks,2018-07-02T10:59:32.060171,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-10T23:37:57.212444,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Authors,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/citation/,tfu6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hnrsm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/relationships/node/,hnrsm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593c8224b83f69023531256b/,593c8224b83f69023531256b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfu6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tfu6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tfu6y,NA
