break the text of a claim into discrete elements or units of text
corresponding to the elements or units that comprise the claimed invention
- essentially, organizing the language of the claims into chunks or quanta
of text. Define an element narrowly - limit it to a single word, say - and
you will tend to narrow the resulting patent, because to prove infringement
the patentee must show that each word has a corresponding structure in the
accused device. By contrast, defining an element broadly tends to broaden
the patent, because it permits the text to read on a greater range of
accused devices.

For each discrete packet identified, the courts must determine the meaning
of the constituent words. They can assign those words definitions that
range from narrow, specific meanings to broad, general meanings. In
determining the meaning of terms within a particular element, judges
practicing patent claim interpretation are engaged in an exercise that to
some degree resembles the famous levels of abstraction test articulated by
Judge Learned Hand for analysis of infringement under copyright law's
idea/expression doctrine.

There are no hard and fast standards in the law by which to make the right
decision as to either the size of the textual element or the level of
abstraction at which it will be evaluated. Indeed, the indeterminacy is so
acute that courts generally don't acknowledge that they are even engaging
in either inquiry. They define an element almost arbitrarily, and even when
judges disagree as to the proper definition they can offer no principled
basis for doing so. The problem may be worse than a simple failure to
acknowledge subconscious decisions that affect the scope of a patent,
however. This indeterminacy may well be inherent in the process of mapping
words to things, as modern literary theorists suggest. While courts purport
to rely on the ordinary or plain meaning of the words of a patent claim,
there may simply be no such thing.

If we can't define the metes and bounds of the invention in any meaningful
way, we might instead start with the patentee's invention itself,
construing patent claims narrowly and in light of the actual invention when
the claim terms are ambiguous. Courts could then supplement this narrower
claim construction with a doctrine of equivalents analysis, which would
permit them to decide how broadly to apply the principle of the invention.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:06.028510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:03:02.349000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/citation/,jn2yz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hkfbb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/relationships/node/,hkfbb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be199c9ad5a101fb68d998/,57be199c9ad5a101fb68d998,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jn2yz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jn2yz

something to say about that, too. Though copyright law (like libel and

the question turns only on whether defendant had the requisite license). We
also argue the same about right of publicity cases, trademark cases, and

systematically overcompensated.'"" However, the error is Golden's not ours.
When patentees systematically capture value they did not create from others
who did create it, they are being overcompensated by any reasonable
measure, including the standard economic models on which we relied. In Part
II, we briefly respond to his criticism of our empirical study of
court-awarded reasonable royalties. Finally, Golden also claims that our
recommendation to reduce the availability of permanent injunctions to
patent holders who have claims to reasonable royalties but not lost profits
remedy ""threatens to distort markets for innovation."" We strongly disagree.

reasonable royalties, that distorts markets for innovation. A rule such as

non-exclusive, fifteen-factor “Georgia-Pacific” test now taken as the gold
standard for calculating reasonable royalty damages. Simply handing the
question of reasonable royalty to the jury, without more, is not a recipe
for precision in damages analysis. But the fifteen-factor test may actually
be worse, because it overloads the jury with factors to consider that may
be irrelevant, overlapping, or even contradictory. And because the jury’s
finding is the result of such a complex, multi-factor test, it is as a
practical matter almost entirely immune from scrutiny by either district or
appellate judges facing a deferential standard of review.

We suggest a structured approach to calculating reasonable royalties. Most
of the factors in the Georgia-Pacific test in fact boil down to three
fundamental questions: (1) what is the marginal contribution of the
patented invention over the prior art, (2) how many other inputs were
necessary to achieve that contribution, and what is their relative value,
and (3) is there some concrete evidence suggesting that the market has
chosen a number different than the product of (1) and (2). By structuring
the inquiry in this way, courts (or Congress) can not only simplify the
question for the jury, but enable district courts and the Federal Circuit
to easily review the factual basis for a jury award.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:07.263160,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:57:33.473000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/citation/,fju3q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7csbh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/relationships/node/,7csbh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be184eb83f6901f86563f2/,57be184eb83f6901f86563f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fju3q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fju3q

validity, infringement and defenses. Virtually every significant legal
doctrine in IP is either about whether the plaintiff has a valid IP right
that the law will recognize – validity – about whether what the defendant
did violates that right – infringement – or about whether the defendant is
somehow privileged to violate that right-defenses.

IP regimes tend to enforce a more or less strict separation between these
three legal doctrines. They apply different burdens of proof and persuasion
to infringement and validity. In many cases they ask different actors to
decide one doctrine but not the other. The U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, for example, decides questions of patent and trademark validity but
not questions of infringement. Even in court, resolution of one issue is
often allocated to a judge while the jury decides a different issue. And
even where none of that is true, the nature of IP law is to categorize an
argument in order to apply the proper rules for that argument.

The result of this separation is that parties treat IP rights “like a nose
of wax, which may be turned and twisted in any direction.” When
infringement is at issue, IP owners tout the breadth of their rights, while
accused infringers seek to cabin them within narrow bounds. When it comes
to validity, however, the parties reverse their position, with IP owners
emphasizing the narrowness of their rights in order to avoid having those
rights held invalid and accused infringers arguing the reverse.

Because of the separation between validity, infringement, and defenses, it
is often possible for a party to successfully argue that an IP right means
one thing in one context and something very different in another. And
courts won’t necessarily detect the problem because they are thinking of
only the precise legal issue before them.

The result is a number of IP doctrines that simply make no sense to an
outsider. In patent law, for instance, it is accepted law that there is no
“practicing the prior art” defense. In other words, one can be held liable
for doing precisely what others had legally done before, even though a
patent isn’t supposed to cover things people have already done. In design
patent law, one can be held liable for making a design that an “ordinary
observer” would find too similar to a patented design, even though the
things that make the two look similar – say, the roundness of the wheels on
my car – are not things the patentee is entitled to own. In copyright, once
a court has concluded that someone has actually copied from the plaintiff,
a song will sometimes be deemed infringing because of its similarity to a
prior song, even if the similarity is overwhelmingly attributable to
unprotectable standard components of the genre. And in trademark, a party
can be deemed infringing because its products look to similar to the
plaintiffs’ mark and therefore make confusion likely, even if that
confusion is likely caused by non-source-designating features of the design.

The culprit is simple, but fundamental: IP regimes largely lack an
integrated procedure for deciding the proper extent of an IP right. The
proper scope of an IP right is not a matter of natural right or immutable
definition. Rather, it is a function of the purposes of the IP regime. But
without some way of assessing how broad an IP right is that considers
validity, infringement, and defenses together, courts will always be prone
to make mistakes in applying any one of the doctrines.

In this article, we suggest that IP regimes need a process for determining
the scope of an IP right. Scope is not merely validity, and it is not
merely infringement. Rather, it is the range of things the IP right
lawfully protects against competition. IP rights that claim too broad a
scope tend to be invalid, either because they tread on the rights of those
who came before or because they cover things that the law has made a
decision not to allow anyone to own. IP rights with narrower scope are
valid, but the narrowness of that scope should be reflected in the
determination of what actions do and do not infringe that right. And
whatever the doctrinal label, we should not allow an IP owner to capture
something that is not within the legitimate scope of her right. Nor should
it follow from the fact that some uses are outside the lawful scope of an
IP owner’s right that the IP right itself is invalid and cannot be asserted
against anyone. Only by evaluating scope in a single, integrated proceeding
can courts avoid the nose of wax problem that has grown endemic in IP law.
Scope is, quite simply, the fundamental question that underlies everything
else in IP law, but which courts rarely think about expressly.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:26.482183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:53:03.052000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/citation/,5z4hv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hafzz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/relationships/node/,hafzz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be17479ad5a1020968da2c/,57be17479ad5a1020968da2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5z4hv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5z4hv

suggest that this diversity of legal rules is largely traceable to
differences in the audience in IP cases. Patent, trademark, copyright, and
design patent each focus on a different person as the fulcrum for
evaluating IP infringement. The fact that patent law focuses on an expert
audience while trademark looks to a consumer audience explains many of the
differences in how patent and trademark cases are decided. Expert audiences
are likely to evaluate infringement based on the technical similarity
between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s works. Consumers, by contrast, are
likely to pay more attention to market substitution and less attention to
how things work under the hood. Understanding the different audiences in IP
infringement is critical to understanding how the IP regimes define
infringement.

The focus on audience has normative as well as descriptive implications.
Neither patent law, with its focus on experts and technical similarity, nor
trademark law, with its market-based consumer focus, has it entirely
correct. Rather, we suggest that as a general matter infringement of an IP
right should require both technical similarity and market substitution.
Assessing infringement through the expert’s eyes ensures that the law
prevents closely related works in the field while allowing later
contributions to the field that are sufficiently different. The consumer
vantage point ensures that we protect IP owners only when they have been
harmed in the marketplace.

IP owners who want to show infringement should have to show both that the
defendant’s work is technically similar to their own from the expert’s

promote overall efficiency in the economy.

While the search costs theory provides a compelling argument for trademark
rights, it also compels an equally important - but often overlooked - set
of principles for defining and limiting those rights. Certainly, trademark
laws can make it easier and cheaper for consumers to locate products with
desired qualities, thus making markets more competitive. Yet if carried too
far, trademark law can do the opposite: it can entrench market dominance by
leading firms and make it harder for competitors to crack new markets. The
evolution of trademark law reflects a continual balancing act that seeks to
maximize the informational value of marks while avoiding their use to
suppress competitive information.

Most of the literature on the search costs theory of trademark law has
focused on the theory as a rationale for trademark protection. In this
article, we examine its role in supporting trademark defenses. We find that
some trademark defenses unambiguously lower consumer search costs and thus
promote the goals of trademark law. Another group of defenses, however,
involves behavior that increases consumer search costs for some individuals
even as it improves economic conditions for others. We believe that these
latter defenses - genericness, functionality, and abandonment - may
sometimes go too far in accepting increased consumer search costs as the
cost of achieving competition. Rather than the all-or-nothing approach
suggested by these doctrines, we suggest that consumers would benefit from
a more nuanced approach in these doctrines.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:30.809539,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:48:41.969000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/citation/,8qs4y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3j7fz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/relationships/node/,3j7fz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be163b594d9001ffd0e398/,57be163b594d9001ffd0e398,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8qs4y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8qs4y

claims - is the most important part of patent litigation. There are a
number of rules or canons that courts can use in applying the interpretive
sources to reach an understanding of what patent claims mean. The canon
that has arguably had the most significant impact on claim construction is
the doctrine of claim differentiation. The claim differentiation doctrine
in its broadest reading provides that no two claims in the same patent
should be interpreted to cover the same thing.

As a general matter, applying the doctrine of claim differentiation results
in broader constructions of patent claims, because it is most commonly used
to prevent defendants from limiting a broad genus claim to the range of
embodiments actually disclosed or more explicitly recited in other claims.
Sometimes this is the right result, because defendants are improperly
seeking to limit broader genus claims to the preferred embodiments
disclosed in the specification. But at other times it leads to problematic
results.

In this article, I conduct an empirical review of claim differentiation
decisions in the Federal Circuit and in the district courts, and I suggest
limiting principles that can be used to distinguish good uses of the
doctrine from bad.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:29.700211,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:46:25.269000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/citation/,8fvrc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2kx63/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/relationships/node/,2kx63,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be15b26c613b01ebd93768/,57be15b26c613b01ebd93768,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fvrc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8fvrc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8fvrc
