Krzhizhanovskii's Energetika and the Concept of Metabolism,"There has been a growing interest in the relation between Marxism and the Soviet Union’s relation to nature. While historical scholarship rarely explores the intellectual context in which the Soviet experiment unfolded, ecomarxists tend to describe the Soviet Union’s mistaken path as a result of the loss of ‘metabolic’ thinkers. This article challenges the neat divide between a ‘metabolic’ and ‘productivist’ Marxism by
analysing the energy-economic thinking of Gleb M. Krzhizhanovskii, chairman of the electrification commission (GOELRO) and the State Planning Commission (Gosplan). Krzhizhanovskii understood human production as part of the general life process and envisioned the energy economy to become an ‘ennobling’ element within nature. His argument rested on the hope that large-scale electrification, district heating and electro-chemistry––realisable under Socialism––could help govern the metabolism between nature and society more rationally.

productivist and metabolic thinking are more intricately connected than thought before.",TRUE,FALSE,critical theory|ecomarxism|electrification|energy history|metabolic rift|soviet union,2021-02-19T22:49:17.553454,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T22:48:39.534628,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d07|Arts and Humanities|Slavic Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/citation/,b3xy7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602fc5174ad52e01776e598f/,602fc5174ad52e01776e598f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3xy7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b3xy7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b3xy7,NA

Previous research suggests that people often underestimate the extent of inequality and that rising inequality aggravates misperceptions. Our study deepens the understanding of the multi-layered processes that form meritocratic beliefs, and it identifies key factors at the macro-, meso-, and micro-level. A macro-level factor that proved influential was a cultural script revolving around the Danish lay concept, social arv [social inheritance]. At the meso level, the factor of reference groups in socio-economic heterogeneous schools was instrumental for formations of inequality perceptions, but in dissimilar ways depending on micro-level subjective factors. Overall, the participants viewed the free educational system in Denmark as a part of a welfare system that equalises opportunity structures in principle, while the majority simultaneously exhibited a nuanced awareness of social forces negating meritocracy in practice.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-19T22:46:31.665338,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T22:46:11.577005,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/citation/,tj5cu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602fc36d34d3040175e3c573/,602fc36d34d3040175e3c573,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tj5cu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tj5cu,NA

Considering multiple background futures instead of one single projection in building time-dependent inventories for assessing LFCE solutions would greatly enhance the robustness of the decision support provided by environmental assessments such as Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). Here, we reviewed, through automatized and manual text-mining, six internationally well-recognized global environmental scenario studies and one intelligence report. The aim was to uncover the key variables and cause-effect relationships at play in these scenario studies. Through constructing causal loop diagrams for each reviewed study, we identified the variables with the greatest number of causal connections, the “cause” and “effect” variables, and revealed the most reported cause-effect relationships across all studies. Our main findings are: (1) the top 5 causal variables are mitigation policies, technological progress, consumers’ awareness, economic growth and education level, while (2) the top 5 affected variables are climate change, materials use, food security, natural ecosystems, and social justice. Amongst the top 10 causal and affected variables (3), 68 connected pairs were identified with no disagreement in their causal relationship directions. The three most reported pairs were (4) mitigation policy → climate change, healthy and sustainable diet → land use, and population → materials use (each reported in four studies). Finally, (5) we highlighted that all the reviewed studies are based on the decision-making logic of maximizing utility. We concluded that identifying these key cause-effect variables and relationships was essential for building time-dependent inventories in LCA, and that these may be a more useful input than the direct use of any of the scenario reviewed herein.",TRUE,FALSE,bioeconomy|causal loop diagram|complex system|gamechangers|prospective life cycle assessment|scenarios|ssps|systems thinking,2021-02-19T22:46:02.298873,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T22:45:38.749415,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/citation/,mb68h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ph97s/,ph97s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602f9ae14ad52e016e6e28e2/,602f9ae14ad52e016e6e28e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mb68h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mb68h,NA

Based on content analyses of 1,269 posts on a Dcard undergrad forum and 614 posts on a PTT senior high forum, which are the two most influential local social media sites in Taiwan, I investigate how students assess the value of degrees and how online platforms shape dominant narratives on choosing a degree. I argue that the value of a degree is congruently defined by the messages surrounding teenagers, which reassign values to degrees in the existing status hierarchy. I call this phenomenon ‘public credentialism,’ a collective status-building process through which individuals assign value to degrees through online narratives, social closure, and online argument styles.

This paper examines the effect of the pandemic on one part of the commercial sex industry: sex trafficking. Our results from scraped sexual service advertisements show that the pandemic has had measurable impact on online advertising for sex trafficking in the United States, with a significant decrease associated with stay-at-home orders followed by an increase to levels well above prepandemic levels as Covid-related restrictions were relaxed. We contribute to the policy landscape by showing that the initial decrease was associated with a loss of demand for sexual services due to pandemic-related health concerns, but that a confluence of factors, including the lack of economic and social support, increased the number of people vulnerable to being exploited. This study can assist policy makers in predicting future changes in the sex industry to support a more just and inclusive society. In the context of future health crises, natural disasters, and major social disruptions it can guide policy makers in apportioning public aid in a way that does not leave vulnerable populations and existing sex workers powerless to being trafficked.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-19T08:56:52.916801,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T08:54:50.812901,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be made available through discussion with the authors.
