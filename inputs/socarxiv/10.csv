Method: One-on-one interviews and small group hui with self-identified Māori university 
staff and students (n = 6) conducted by an early-career Māori scientist. 
Results: Key themes were the importance of achieving improved health outcomes for Māori 
through addressing known socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors that perpetuate 
health disparities. Other findings were the value of recognising the diversity in modern Māori 
identities, perspectives, and communities, as well as views on using synthetic biomolecules in 
medical devices and perceptions of biotechnology, and the potential for cultural over?engagement or misplaced focus in consultation. 
Conclusion: Direct-to-consumer POC testing may promote kaupapa Māori values such as 
tino rangatiratanga, whakawhanaungatanga and tikanga, which may help Māori overcome 
barriers to health care and testing, a key step in achieving improved health outcomes. We 
describe our approach and experience of consultation as laboratory-based researchers to 
encourage other researchers/developers to engage directly with Māori during the design

Research postgraduate students (n=310) at a research- intensive university in Hong Kong, engaging in a 24-hour introductory teaching course, participated in this study. Learner readiness for the course was assessed as prior Domain interest, self-efficacy, and knowledge. Subsequently, students completed four formative assessments, reported their on-task interest in seven strategically chosen tasks and end-of- course Course and Domain interest. Longitudinal-SEM tested interconnections between readiness components, Task, Course and Domain interest. Initial self-efficacy beliefs for teaching predicted early Task interest, while Domain interest was a predictor of Task interest in explicitly practical task experiences.

Social media content both reflect and construct the social meanings of topics and events. We thus draw from social media to understand how George Floyd and Covid-19 inform and inflect each other, building a dataset from ~20,000 tweets that unite prevalent hashtags associated with each. Analyses reveal a repeating set of symbolic hooks—death, breath, masks, and voice—encompassing dense and competing narratives about justice and injustice, systemic inequality, degrading trust in institutions, and the changing identity of a nation.

This chapter reflects on the history and trajectory of urban analytics as a scholarly and professional discipline. In particular, it considers the direction in which this field is going and whether it improves our collective and individual welfare. It first introduces early theories, models, and deductive methods from which the field originated before shifting toward induction. It then explores urban network analytics that enrich traditional representations of spatial interaction and structure. Next it discusses urban applications of spatiotemporal big data and machine learning. Finally, it argues that privacy and ethical concerns are too often ignored as ubiquitous monitoring and analytics can empower social repression. It concludes with a call for a more critical urban analytics that recognizes its epistemological limits, emphasizes human dignity, and learns from and supports marginalized communities.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|computer science|critical theory|data science|epistemology|ethics|geospatial|machine learning|network science|physics|privacy|simulation|smart cities|spatial interaction|spatiotemporal big data|statistics|transportation|transport modeling|urban analytics|urban data science|urban design|urban geography|urban informatics|urban modeling|urban networks|urban planning|urban policy,2021-05-14T20:35:40.936619,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-14T20:35:23.768646,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dec|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Transportation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",Geoff Boeing|Michael Batty|Shan Jiang|Lisa Schweitzer,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/citation/,bwhx2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609ebc1e58d9d900f613c5d2/,609ebc1e58d9d900f613c5d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwhx2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bwhx2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bwhx2,NA

Health Influencers:  how wellness culture and web culture have been weaponised to promote COVID-19 conspiracy theories and far-right extremism.,"This article examines the proliferation of alt. health influencers during the COVID-19 pandemic. I analyse the presentation strategies used by four alt. health influencers to achieve visibility and status on Instagram over a 12-month period from the date the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020. My analysis reveals the ways in which these influencers appeal to the utopian discourses of early web culture and the underlying principles of wellness culture to build and sustain an online following. While early accounts of micro-celebrity treat participatory culture as democratising and progressive, this article demonstrates how the participatory affordances of social media have been exploited to spread conspiratorial thinking and far-right extremism. These findings develop previous work on ‘micro-celebrity’ and ‘conspirituality’ by demonstrating how wellness culture and web culture can coalesce for authoritarian ends.",TRUE,FALSE,conspiracy theories|conspirituality|COVID-19|far-right|influencers|micro-celebrity|trust|web culture|wellness culture,2021-05-14T20:21:42.005342,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-14T20:21:09.348992,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Stephanie Alice Baker,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/citation/,jt2ha,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609e693458d9d900cc13ca45/,609e693458d9d900cc13ca45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt2ha/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jt2ha/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jt2ha,NA

It is unclear if current livestock feed resources are adequately prepared to meet future demand especially given the looming challenges of climate change. Many feeds such as grasses, crop by-products, and other biomass may not be widely grown commercially or sold in formal markets but are critical sources of livestock feed in many low-resource settings in which ruminant livestock production is important. The availability of these feed types can determine the extent to which the livestock sector can expand to meet growing, and sometimes critical, demand for animal-source foods. In this paper, we compare country-level projections of livestock demand from a global economic model to simulated data on feed biomass production. Our comparisons account separately for beef, lamb, and dairy demand. The data allow us to assess the future sufficiency of key sources of feed biomass, and hence aspects of the expansion capacity of livestock production in selected countries in Southern Africa. Our simulation results project that given the interacting effects of projected climate change and changes in income and population in the region, there will not be enough feed biomass produced domestically to meet growing demand for livestock products. For three types of feed biomass (feed crops including grains, grasses, and crop by-products) for which future livestock feed sufficiency was examined, our results showed feed sufficiency declines for all three feed types in Malawi and Mozambique, for two out of three in South Africa and for one of three in Zambia, under intermediate and extreme scenarios of climate change in 2050. Our results suggest an urgent need to improve feed biomass productivity to support future supply of animal protein in the study countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Climate Change|Feeds|G-Range model|IMPACT model|Livestock|Scenarios,2021-05-16T03:16:01.079445,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-16T03:15:43.631929,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/IFPRI/IMPACT|https://github.com/rboone2020/g-range,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/citation/,qmdrt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609e619558d9d900d213e02f/,609e619558d9d900d213e02f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdrt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qmdrt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qmdrt,NA

A Responsible Management Approach,"This paper conceptualises a Lego Serious Play Wheel framework as a gamification teaching and learning method. It aims to offer a detailed approach from Design and Preparation to Delivery, to engage a broad section of continuing learners and students, which can be easily applied throughout different educational and training contexts. The LSP Wheel refers to the concept of a circular learning journey and draws on a combined autoethnography responsible management research approach. A prominent part of the responsible management literature has hitherto focused on examining whether responsible management modules are inherently considered non-crucial elements of curriculum design. However, there is a paucity of research into applying novel teaching approaches to engage students and promote responsible management education endeavours. This paper therefore contributes to broader pedagogical application and critical responsible management education discourse, by providing educators with an academic gamification framework to support student engagement and co-creation of knowledge, by fostering exploratory learning environments and enriching the practices of active learning communities.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Gamification|Learning|Lego Serious Play|LSP|LSP Wheel|Project Management|Responsible Management|Teaching,2021-05-19T19:16:24.680126,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-14T20:40:05.503445,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/citation/,vdzsu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609e2eb658d9d900ab140199/,609e2eb658d9d900ab140199,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vdzsu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vdzsu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vdzsu,NA
