significant exceptions, the basic rule of trademark law is that a
defendant’s use of a mark is illegal if it confuses a substantial number of
consumers and not otherwise.

As a general matter, this is the right rule. Trademark law is designed to
facilitate the workings of modern markets by permitting producers to
accurately communicate information about the quality of their products to
buyers, and therefore to encourage them to invest in making quality
products in circumstances in which that quality wouldn’t otherwise be
apparent. If competitors can falsely mimic that information, they will
confuse consumers, who won’t know whether they are in fact getting a high
quality product and therefore won’t be willing to pay as much for that
quality. I won’t pay as much for an iPod if I think there is a chance it is
a cheap knock-off masquerading as an iPod.

The law of false advertising operates as an adjunct to trademark law. While
trademark law prevents competitors from misrepresenting the source of their
products by mimicking another’s brand name, the law of false advertising
prevents false or misleading statements about the quality of one’s own or a
competitor’s products. Like trademark law, false advertising law is
designed to protect the integrity of markets by allowing consumers to rely
on statements made by sellers.

Unfortunately, trademark law has taken the concept of confusion too far.
Between 1930 and 1980, courts expanded the concept of confusion beyond
confusion as to the source of a product to include the possibility that
consumers are confused as to whether the trademark owner sponsors or is
affiliated with the defendant’s goods. This expansion began for plausible
reasons: consumers might be confused to their detriment in a variety of
circumstances in which the plaintiff and the defendant do not actually
compete directly. But sponsorship and affiliation confusion has taken on a
life of its own, resulting in a large number of cases in which companies or
individuals are prevented from doing things that might conceivably confuse
consumers, but do not confuse consumers in any way that harms their
decision-making process or that the law should care about. In Part I, we
offer a number of examples of “confusion” that courts have found actionable
even in circumstances in which that confusion was unlikely to matter to the
operation of the market. Part II explains how we arrived at this
unfortunate pass.

We suggest in Part III that trademark law should focus its attention on
confusion that is actually relevant to purchasing decisions. We would make
the source of the goods the central element of confusion analysis. It is
confusion as to source that is most obviously relevant to the purposes
behind trademark law. That does not mean, however, that confusion as to the
relationship between plaintiff and defendant can never be actionable.
Confusion as to affiliation should be actionable when consumers are likely
to believe that the trademark owner stands behind or guarantees the quality
of the goods the defendant sells. Even if consumers understand that
individual franchisees, rather than the McDonald’s Corporation, actually
make their hamburgers, they are likely to expect that McDonald’s stands
behind whatever quality that brand represents.

Finally, the fact that confusion as to sponsorship or affiliation should
not generally be trademark infringement does not mean that it will never be
actionable. Some statements that create confusion as to sponsorship or
affiliation will be actionable as a form of false advertising. We address
the scope of false advertising in Part IV. Notably, proof of a false
advertising claim requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the
misrepresentation is material – that it is likely to affect a product
purchasing decision. Indeed, the statute specifies the sorts of
misrepresentations that are forbidden. We continue the discussion in Part
V, which explores some of the implications of shunting some cases into the
false advertising framework, and discusses how to handle some close cases.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:18.102146,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:27:31.615000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/citation/,4ea9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8wg4s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/relationships/node/,8wg4s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be11459ad5a1020968da1e/,57be11459ad5a1020968da1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ea9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ea9v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ea9v

the global market for licensing and marketing sports-related merchandise at
$17 billion in 2001. With this much money at stake, it's no surprise that
trademark holders demand royalties for use of their marks on shirts, key
chains, jewelry, and related consumer products. After all, the value of
these products comes largely from the allure of the trademarks, and it
seems only fair to reward the party that created that value . . . doesn't
it?

It turns out that the answer is more complicated than this intuitive
account would predict. Trademark law historically has existed primarily to
protect against the consumer deception that occurs when one party attempts
to pass off its products as those of another. From an economic and policy
perspective, it is by no means obvious that trademark holders should have
exclusive rights over the sale of products that use marks for their
ornamental or intrinsic value, rather than as indicators of source or
official sponsorship. Trademark law seeks to promote, rather than hinder,
truthful competition in markets for products sought by consumers; if a
trademark is the product, then giving one party exclusive rights over it
runs in tension with the law's pro-competitive goals, frequently without
any deception-related justification. On the other hand, there may be
circumstances in which consumers expect that trademark holders sponsored or
produced products bearing their mark, in which case use of the mark by
others - even as a part of a product - might result in genuine confusion.

Given these complexities, together with the economic interests at stake,
one might expect that the law and practice of merchandising rights would be
well-settled and reflect a considered balancing of the interests of
trademark holders and their competitors. In reality, however, much of the
multi-billion dollar industry of merchandise licensing has grown around a
handful of cases from the 1970s and 1980s that established merchandising
rights with little regard for the competing legal or policy concerns at
stake. Those cases are far from settled law - indeed, at least as many
decisions decline to give trademark owners the right to control sales of
their trademarks as products. We think it is high time to revisit that case
law and to reconsider the theoretical justifications for a merchandising
right.

That review provides little support for trademark owners' assumptions about
merchandising. Doctrinally, the most broad-reaching merchandising cases -
which presumed infringement based on the public recognition of the mark as
a trademark - were simply wrong in their analysis of trademark infringement
and have been specifically rejected by subsequent decisions.
Philosophically, even a merchandising right that hinges on likelihood of
confusion raises competition-related concerns that should affect courts'
analysis of both the merits and appropriate remedies in merchandising
cases. Perhaps most importantly, recent Supreme Court case law suggests
that, if it had the opportunity to evaluate the merchandising theory
(something it has never done), the Court would deny the existence of such a
right. Further, the Court would be right to do so. When a trademark is
sold, not as a source indicator, but as a desirable feature of a product,
competition suffers - and consumers pay - if other sellers are shut out of
the market for that feature.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:17.454243,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:27:24.093000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/citation/,4csmu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/46n2m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/relationships/node/,46n2m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be113d9ad5a101f668de00/,57be113d9ad5a101f668de00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4csmu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4csmu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4csmu

those previous decisions have a high likelihood of accuracy, and the patent
system should endeavor to create processes that fit this mold. But granting
significant deference to the initial process of patent review is
indefensible and counter-productive. Patents should be vulnerable to
challenge until and unless they are significantly evaluated in an
information-rich environment. At that point, they will have earned and
therefore should be accorded a presumption of validity. Such an approach
would better serve the patent's systems long-run incentive goals, and it
would give patent applicants better incentives to file for genuine
inventions but leave their more obvious and incremental accomplishments
outside the patent system's purview. Here, we therefore suggest the
creation of a two-tier system of patent validity, with patents that are
subject to intensive scrutiny accorded a strong presumption of validity,
while untested patents are left to be evaluated more fully in court.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:08.613001,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T19:08:45.618000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/citation/,knvp3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3kt2u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/relationships/node/,3kt2u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bdf0bf6c613b01ead9380b/,57bdf0bf6c613b01ead9380b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knvp3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/knvp3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/knvp3

independent development. To infringe a copyright or trade secret,
defendants must copy the protected IP from the plaintiff, directly or
indirectly. But patent infringement requires only that the defendant's
product falls within the scope of the patent claims. Not only doesn't the
defendant need to intend to infringe, but the defendant may be entirely
unaware of the patent or the patentee and still face liability.

Nonetheless, copying does play a role in some subsidiary patent doctrines.
For example, the question of whether patent damages should be set in order
to deter infringement depends critically on whether infringers are in fact
aware they are infringing, or at least that they are using the plaintiff's
technology. Copying - or at least intent to infringe - is also an element
of claims for indirect infringement. The definition of ""willful
infringement"" also turns on the question of culpability, at least in the
popular understanding of that term. More significantly, the rhetoric of
patent law (and of IP law more generally) often seems to presuppose that
defendants in patent cases are in fact engaged in copying. Similarly, the
outcome of public policy debates over patent reform may well turn on the
perception of patent infringers as either bad actors or as innocent
businesspeople who accidentally ran afoul of a patent.

Unfortunately, no one seems to know whether patent infringement defendants
are in fact unscrupulous copyists or independent developers. In this paper,
we seek to answer that question. Because copying is not an element of any
patent cause of action, courts do not normally make explicit findings as to
whether defendants have copied. Instead, we turn to a variety of proxies to
try to identify the subset of cases in which copying is alleged or proven.
We look both at the allegations made in a random sample of complaints and
at the treatment of copying in recent reported decisions. We find that a
surprisingly small percentage of patent cases involve even allegations of
copying, much less proof of copying. Copying in patent law seems to be the
exception, not the rule.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:36.746246,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T19:05:56.763000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/citation/,anz2u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v8djb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/relationships/node/,v8djb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bdf0169ad5a101fa68da32/,57bdf0169ad5a101fa68da32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/anz2u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/anz2u
