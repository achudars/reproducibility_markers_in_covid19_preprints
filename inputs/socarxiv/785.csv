2014. Unlike the prior literature, this study analyzes federal copyright,
patent, and trademark litigation trends as a unified whole. It undertakes a
systematic analysis of the records of more than 190,000 cases filed in
federal courts and examines the subject matter, geographical, and temporal
variation within federal IP litigation over the last two decades.

This Article analyzes changes in the distribution of IP litigation over
time and their regional distribution. The key findings of this Article stem
from an attempt to understand long-term patterns in the filing data as well
as short-term deviations from various trends. This data-driven approach has
yielded insights in relation to such diverse topics as Internet filesharing
litigation, the true impact of patent trolls on the level of patent
litigation, and the extent of forum shopping and forum selling patent
litigation. Just as importantly, this Article lays the foundation for
planning and evaluating future empirical studies of IP litigation with a

Central to both is the term ""reasonable."" How should that term be understood? Does it mean that the Federal Circuit grants deference to the Patent Office when reviewing its constructions, as some commentators describe and some opinions suggest? And, perhaps more importantly, what is a ""broadest reasonable interpretation"" and how does that fit into the process of claim construction generally?

Here, I argue that regardless of one's view on the historical nature of judicial review of Patent Office claim interpretation, any deference is inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's use of a de novo standard when reviewing claim interpretations by the Patent Office (with the exception of findings of fact relating to extrinsic evidence). Second, I argue that the still-developing jurisprudence at the Federal Circuit is coalescing around a meaning of ""broadest reasonable interpretation"" that allows for the existence of multiple ordinary meanings and reads the intrinsic evidence with a certain degree of ""looseness,"" but which is still hesitant to embrace ambiguity within the application of the tools of claim construction.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:32.126519,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-01T18:33:01.090000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/citation/,dhwna,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/suy37/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/relationships/node/,suy37,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57aa41c89ad5a101f1f58d4a/,57aa41c89ad5a101f1f58d4a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhwna/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dhwna/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dhwna

Based on an analysis of print media and journalists’ interviews, this
article examines the representation of atrocity and mass violence in
Africa. It specifically focuses on the atrocities in Darfur and Rwanda and
compares African and western coverage of them. It argues that since
representations (just as the knowledge that anchors them) are highly
dependent on one’s social location it is necessary to understand multiple
representations of the same atrocity. Though literature on representation
of Africa has been critical of western representations of Africa, this

EU members, being contrary to the concept of waste hierarchy promoted in
recent years by EC. Waste disposal is done usually in non-compliant
landfills and Government established a program to close these sites. This
paper aims to analyse the transition from traditional waste management
systems to an integrated system at national, regional and local scale.
Assessment of landfills location based on buffer analysis (using GIS
techniques) is made according to the proximity of five critical factors
(CF) such as residential area, industry & commercial units, agricultural
lands, rivers & lakes, forest and protected areas, all these factors being
sensitive to pollution. Thus, most of these old sites are badly or
improperly located related to surroundings and only a few have an
acceptable location in the study area! Therefore, the proposed method can
be a necessary tool in EIA studies of these environmental threats at the
regional scale.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,engrxiv|environment|geography|GIS|land use|pollution|Preprint|socarxiv|spatial analysis|urban studies|waste management,2018-07-02T10:51:45.096992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-29T14:37:34.263000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/citation/,njzrc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zu7x6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/relationships/node/,zu7x6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/579b6a2f594d9002012fccd6/,579b6a2f594d9002012fccd6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzrc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/njzrc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/njzrc
