Although macroeconomic stance is of paramount importance for contemporary governments, our understanding of its popular politics is limited. We argue that popular attitudes regarding austerity are influenced by media (and wider elite) framing. Information necessary to form preferences on the deficit is not provided neutrally, and its provision shapes how voters understand their interests.   A wide range of evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim.  In the British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public borrowing --- in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their readerships. Finally, a survey experiment suggests causation from media to attitudes: deficit preferences change based on the presentation of deficit information.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:23.081269,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-01T12:28:53.111365,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/citation/,ypuq8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xzc42/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/relationships/node/,xzc42,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a213c13b83f690266becaf0/,5a213c13b83f690266becaf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ypuq8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ypuq8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ypuq8

Test procedural justice theory by examining the extent to which procedural justice mediates the impact of contact with the police on various outcomes. Apply causal mediation analysis to better interpret data from a field experiment that had suffered from a particular type of implementation failure.

Methods: Data from a block-randomised controlled trial of procedural justice policing (the Scottish Community Engagement Trial) were analysed. All constructs were measured using surveys distributed during roadside police checks. The treatment implementation was assessed by analysing the treatment effect consistency and heterogeneity. Causal mediation analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to assess the mediating role of procedural justice.

Results: First, the treatment effect was consistent and fairly homogeneous, indicating that the systematic variation in the study is attributable to the design. Second, procedural justice acts as a mediator channelling the treatment’s effect towards normative alignment (NIE=-0.207), duty to obey (NIE=-0.153), sense of power (NIE=-0.078), and social identity (NIE=-0.052), all of which are moderately robust to unmeasured confounding. The NIEs for risk of sanction and personal morality were highly sensitive, while for coerced obligation and sense of power they were non-significant.
 
Conclusions: Causal mediation analysis is a versatile tool that can salvage experiments with systematic yet ambiguous treatment effects by allowing researchers to “pry open” the black box of causality. Most of the theoretical propositions of procedural justice policing were supported. Future studies are needed with more discernible causal mediation effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Causal inference|Causal mediation analysis|Police legitimacy|Potential outcome framework|Procedural justice policing|Sensitivity analysis,2018-07-02T11:25:50.833812,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-29T17:56:05.682630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Krisztián Pósch,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/citation/,9x7n6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u8kxs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/relationships/node/,u8kxs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a1e9be7b83f69027cbfdbb3/,5a1e9be7b83f69027cbfdbb3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9x7n6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9x7n6

Second, a comprehensive definition of legitimacy is employed that differentiates between (i)police and law and (ii)right to rule and entitlement to be obeyed judgements. Third, the concept of “bounded authority” is added to the framework. The findings indicate qualified support for the normative model of crime control, but only with respect to grey crimes.

However, it must be said that these articles do not declare the invalidity of normal documents absolutely, but the meaning of the non-acceptability of such documents is that they cannot be referred to in relation to third parties, while such documents are valid and authentic for the parties to the contract, and because of the fact that the document is a normal contract, the parties to the contract cannot refuse to fulfill their commitment and execute the contract by the excuse that such documents must have been registered in accordance with the law. Therefore, referring to ordinary settlement agreement, the grantee cannot claim the propriety of some property against persons other than grantor, but in the case of denial of the occurrence of a transaction between the parties to the settlement, the beneficiary can refer to the ordinary document of that transaction to prove the occurrence of the transaction between themself and the other person, and such a reference is reviewable by the court. In addition to that the grantor and grantee can refer to ordinary document and any provable evidence in their controversy and dispute about the settlement subject and prove the occurrence of settlement, the grantee can bring an action against the grantor and obligate them to arrange an official settlement document by proving the settlement and by invoking to Article 220 of the Civil Code, because according to the mentioned article, transactors are not only committed to what is stated in the contract, but are also committed to all the results of the contract in accordance with customs or law. However, if a dispute occurs between the grantee and a third party about the settlement subject and an action is brought, then if the grantee presents the ordinary settlement document to prove their ownership, the court according to the Registration Law will not consider that document effective, and the grantee may even be convicted against the third party.

The second half of the paper details how smart cities shape the nature of temporal modalities, considering how they reframe and utilise the relationship between the past, present and future.

The Coolabilities concept can be useful in any context that aims to increase the value of people, with a large impact on the labor market. Individuals labeled as “disabled” are defined by what they cannot do, while “coolabled” people are defined by their strengths and are an untapped resource of special talent. The purpose of this study is to present the general coolabilities concept, discuss its validity and demonstrate its relevance by suggesting future research and applications enabled by it, with the main focus on human resource management.",TRUE,FALSE,ADHD|ASD|Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Disabilities|Dyslexia|Enhanced Abilities|HRM|Human Resource Management|Talent Management,2018-07-02T11:25:45.721854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-26T18:18:22.584407,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/citation/,stgd4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mbt2f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/relationships/node/,mbt2f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a19fa409ad5a10266cd60b5/,5a19fa409ad5a10266cd60b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/stgd4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/stgd4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/stgd4

We examine the extent to which incarceration shifts the balance of a representative democracy by considering its impact on legislative apportionment. Drawing on data from the Census, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, and Pennsylvania Redistricting Commission, we develop a counterfactual framework to examine whether removing and returning prisoners to their home districts affects equal representation. Because prisoners are disproportionately African American, we also employ this counterfactual to assess racial differences in the impact of prison gerrymandering. Findings indicate that incarceration shifts political power from urban districts to suburban and rural districts through legislative apportionment. Moreover, non-white communities suffer the most. We conclude by considering how our findings fit a growing literature on the role of mass incarceration in [re]producing racial inequalities in the contemporary United States.",TRUE,FALSE,incarceration|political representation|prison gerrymandering|racial inequality,2018-07-02T11:25:43.579678,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-24T21:23:08.097999,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/citation/,egd72,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4un6m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/relationships/node/,4un6m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a187d57594d90026ff0e56f/,5a187d57594d90026ff0e56f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd72/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/egd72/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/egd72
