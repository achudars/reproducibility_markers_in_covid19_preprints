In this paper, for the first time, we attempt to verify some of the reported attributes for a small sample of Canadian universities, namely for the largest engineering schools. We examined more than 60 departments and units at 11 universities. We show that academic inbreeding is in fact present at the investigated units with a national average of 23%. Twelve departments exhibited a Z-score of one (inbreeding index larger than 34%, four departments showed a Z-score score of almost 2 and higher (inbreeding index larger than 44%). As well, we demonstrate that the quality of publications, measured by the number citations, appears to be lower for the inbreds.

Using Geomagic Design X (reverse-engineering software) and Geomagic Verify (inspection software), metrics associated with rotational asymmetry were generated and analyzed. Future directions include the incorporation of directional and fluctuating asymmetry measures of the widest vessel profiles, which were calculated in Design X then analyzed using the geomorph package in R.

in improving students' ability to recall and spell newly learned vocabulary items. The researcher
only considered three types of MSs: grouping, placing new words in to a context and structured
reviewing. In addition, the study used a questionnaire that explored students' attitudes towards
MSs in general, and towards the specific MSs that they have been trained to use, as well as the
relationship between MSs and motivation and between MSs and anxiety.  intact groups (63 students in total) were selected from level three of the College of Languages and Translation (COLT) at King Saud University (KSU), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The two groups were assigned to the experimental group (36 students) and the control group(27students). The control group received traditional instruction that depended on the textbook without any MS training, whereas the experimental group received a combination of traditional instruction and MS training. A pre- and post-test were administered to both groups before and after the experiment to examine students' ability to recall the meaning of vocabulary items and their ability to spell them correctly. The experiment lasted for fourteen weeks through which the participants received seven MS training sessions. The study found out that MS training was effective in improving students' ability to recall the meaning of vocabulary items when needed and their ability to spell them correctly. Moreover, the results showed that the subjects of the experimental group showed positive attitude towards MSs and most of them agreed on the positive effect that MSs had on raising their motivation and reducing their anxiety while learning vocabulary.",TRUE,FALSE,|anxiety|effectiveness|memory strategies|translation|vocabulary,2018-07-02T11:57:42.433869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:30:17.625146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/citation/,5vhrq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sw9pr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/relationships/node/,sw9pr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dec2cdaf8210012d552c7/,5b2dec2cdaf8210012d552c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vhrq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5vhrq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5vhrq,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.205

Therefore, the study presented vowel instruction as an intervention to address this issue by determining its effect on the spelling performance on monosyllables and bi-syllables. Vowel instruction sessions were then offered to 15 university freshman students for two months. Instructional strategies consisted of teaching vowel pronunciation, vowel letter-to-sound relationships, vowel spelling patterns, word-breaking, and providing various spelling opportunities. To measure overall spelling performance, pre-test and post-test on vowel spellings were conducted which revealed a significant increase in the mean scores. This suggests that vowel instruction was facilitative in the improved spelling performance on monosyllabic and bi-syllabic words, with more misspellings in the latter than in the former. The strategies used were generally perceived as beneficial, and it is recommended that including them in language lessons could improve vowel spelling skill and minimize English vowel confusions.

Screening candidates and selecting the fittest to serve as mentors is an essential process to the successful provision of the necessary professional and personal assistance to the new entrants to the profession. Based on this premise, the present conceptual paper aims to provide a new perspective to the selection process of mentor teachers to support pre-service English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers in the Moroccan context. At the current time, the only formal requirements for becoming a mentor are based on a simple expression of interest and a consideration of the academic qualifications the candidate has. This method of selection proved to be problematic in light of new empirical evidence that showed its inherent limitedness and how it created unnecessary difficulties for trainee teachers during practice teaching. The Tri-spheric Ecological Approach to Mentor Selection (TEAMS) framework this paper tries to put forward adds more layers to the screening process of mentor teachers and places it in a wider context with more important factors and players to consider.

However, the impact of students’ perceived self-efficacy on their academic achievements needs more attention. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of self-efficacy on English language proficiency of students at Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. This study attempts to answer the question whether there exists any relationship between Saudi students’ perceived self-efficacy and their achievement in English language learning. Self-efficacy scales were used to gather data from 230 preparatory year students from Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Fifteen out of seventy-six sections were randomly selected from the three streams, namely, Medical, Scientific and Administration. For data analysis, descriptive statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. It is significant in terms of providing insights into the psychology of the students particularly regarding their perceived self-efficacy which will be of great help to the course designers, content developers and teachers in taking measures for the inclusion of the content to improve students’ self-efficacy. The findings show that there exists a positive correlation between General and English self-efficacy and achievements in English language learning. However, there is no positive correlation between social self-efficacy and English language achievements. On the basis of the findings, the study provides some recommendations to improve students’ self-efficacy for better performance in learning English.

The primary area of emphasis is to consider whether the use of L1 in the class reduces the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety (FLCA) or it deprives the learners of the real and constant language inputs, viz., the words of the teacher in the target language. Thus, the main research question of the study is how the medium of instruction (use/mixing of Arabic or use of English-only approach) impacts the FLCA (Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety) of Saudi adult learners. The quantitative research tool of survey has been administered on the teachers and students on five-point Likert-scale with the responses ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. There are twelve items in the survey and each item tends to explore different psychological dimension of the issue. 100 adult Saudi university students and 100 EFL teachers have responded to these items. The main finding of the study is that  learner’s L1 speeds up the language learning process in a natural way if used occasionally and judiciously with the objective of keeping self-esteem and self image of the learners intact and bringing their FLCA down. The research study not only brings to surface the current state of bilingual EFL education in Saudi context, but also puts forth recommendations for learners, teachers, administrators, and policy makers to strengthen English language teaching/learning in EFL perspective in the bilingual context.",TRUE,FALSE,bilingual education|foreign language classroom anxiety|medium of instruction|psychological factors|quantitative tool,2018-07-02T11:57:42.294916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:33:55.548772,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/citation/,8rxeu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5sx74/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/relationships/node/,5sx74,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2de806daf8210010d45d6e/,5b2de806daf8210010d45d6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rxeu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8rxeu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8rxeu,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.25

However, in the case of Moroccan educational settings, it is noticed that schools continue to be characterized by traditional and conventional instruction. It is true that some students excel in traditional teaching delivery; however, creative learners are neglected and at risk of being rejected. Understanding the nature of creativity and putting it into action are of paramount importance for students to pursue creative opportunities in their own life. This study aims at (1) assessing 22 Moroccan Master’s students’ general perceptions and attitudes towards creativity; (2) improving students’ creativity by introducing them to a list of creativity techniques; (3) evaluating how effectively the proposed creativity training workshops have influenced students’ initial views of creativity. The study used questionnaire inquiry data analysis to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings reveal that students hold positive attitudes towards creativity in education. More importantly, the study shows how the proposed creativity training workshops have positively affected students’ initial perceptions and attitudes towards creativity.",TRUE,FALSE,Creativity techniques|effects|higher education|perceptions|teaching for creativity,2018-07-02T11:57:42.259720,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:34:17.118676,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/citation/,6p9ma,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wx2zt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/relationships/node/,wx2zt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2de70adaf8210011d42317/,5b2de70adaf8210011d42317,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p9ma/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6p9ma/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6p9ma,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.24
