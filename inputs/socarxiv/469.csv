Testing a Salience Model on German Service Sector Employees,"The present study tested an extended version of Voydanoff's (2004) 'differential salience vs. comparable salience' model in a sample of German service workers. Our findings partially support the model in a different national/cultural context but also yielded some divergent findings with respect to within-domain resources and boundary-spanning demands. In line with the theoretical framework, work-to-home interference (WHI) mainly occurred because of high work demands and not because of a lack of work resources. Boundary-spanning resources yielded comparable potential to reduce WHI and enhance work-to-home enrichment (WHE). WHE was expected to more likely occur due to the activation of work resources rather than the absence of work demands. However, control over one's work did not have a significant impact on WHE. In addition and contrary to the theoretical model, boundary-spanning demands were found to be differentially rather than comparably salient to the work–family interface.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-15T21:47:21.461992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T21:34:46.260928,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",The authors,2011,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/citation/,2jva4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8bfd9180f5d2001783073b/,5c8bfd9180f5d2001783073b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2jva4/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2010.07.008,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2jva4

This finding, however, can depict people of color or poor people as more prejudiced than White, middle-class families. In this 18-month ethnographic study, the author complicates this rejection paradigm through documenting the narratives of 40 LGBTQ youth experienc- ing homelessness. The author examines how poverty and family instability shaped the con- ditions that the youth perceived as their being rejected because of their gender and sexuality. This rejection generated strained familial ties within families wherein the ties were already fragile. Likewise, the author shows how being gender expansive marked many youth’s experi- ences of familial abuse and strain.

In particular, I define lineal kinship organization as a social system that emphasizes interactions among lineally related kin — that is, individuals related through females only, if the emphasis is towards matrilineal kin, and individuals related through males only, if the emphasis is towards patrilineal kin. In a given population, the emphasis may be expressed in one or more social domains, corresponding to pathways for the transmission of different resources across generations (e.g. the allocation of food, the transfer of access to the natal territory or household).
A lineal bias in any domain can be viewed as a bias in investment towards a particular set of kin — specifically, towards the offspring of daughters if the bias is matrilineal, and towards the offspring of sons if the bias is patrilineal. Effectively, investment is restricted to the offspring of the females in the population in one case, and to the offspring of the males in the other. This is distinct from a bias in investment towards daughters and towards sons, respectively.
Overall, I propose a shift in focus — from viewing matrilineal and patrilineal kinship as unitary phenomena, to consideration of the different aspects of the social system featuring a bias towards lineally related kin.",TRUE,FALSE,descent|kinship systems|lineal kinship organization|matrilineal|patrilineal|post-marital residence,2019-03-15T18:28:41.535204,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T18:20:56.130140,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/citation/,2sznm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8bd6b3075b640019a2ae7b/,5c8bd6b3075b640019a2ae7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sznm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2sznm

Identity, desistance and the experience of imprisonment","Desistance research has pushed criminologists to develop a nuanced conceptual account of criminal identity and human agency. However, these tools have mostly not been used to consider identity changes among long-sentenced prisoners, despite the growing preponderance of long-term imprisonment in England and Wales. As a result of this, desistance theory has not been used to evaluate the administration of indeterminate sentences, meaning that practitioners may be missing out on some of the insights that it can generate. This qualitative study begins to fill that gap, using a phenomenological analysis of eighteen in-depth semi-structured interviews with life- sentenced prisoners at a single prison in England, all of whom had been convicted of murder. It argues that most eventually attempt conscious projects of personal change during imprisonment; second, that many frame change in terms which are not consistent with the official discourses of risk reduction (which govern their progression through the sentence); and third, that how they themselves conceive and pursue personal change is affected by their position in the sentence and the life course, and also by the specific nature and circumstances of their index offences. The analysis classifies four different styles of agency found in the sample: ‘defensive’ and ‘fractured’ agents were unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for the offence, and were consequently in penal ‘dead ends’; while ‘corrective’ and ‘redemptive’ agents had encountered ‘turning points’, in that they accepted responsibility, albeit in different ways. The analysis describes each group’s characteristic ways of describing the offence and their part in it. It also describes their attitudes to prison social life in general, and to rehabilitative intervention in particular. The study as a whole suggests that much of the personal change which lifers themselves frame as significant happens outside rehabilitative interventions, and may be invisible to key prison staff. This raises important questions about whether prisons and prisoners think about rehabilitation in the same way, with consequences for the legitimacy of penal power.",TRUE,FALSE,criminology|desistance|england and wales|human agency|indeterminate imprisonment|life sentences|long-term imprisonment|prisons|risk-needs-responsivity|risk reduction,2019-03-15T15:45:22.888700,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T15:30:16.481471,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/citation/,3phn7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8b7e1280f5d2001681ddc2/,5c8b7e1280f5d2001681ddc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3phn7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3phn7

Our approach draws on two tools commonly used by professional software engineers but not widely used by academic researchers: software containers (e.g., Docker) and cloud computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services).

Climate change mitigation requires active local level implementation, but it remains unclear which institutional arrangements maximize support for environmental rules. In this paper, we run a conjoint experiment with elite members of 10 Latin American countries and ask respondents to evaluate institutional designs drawn from a pool of 5,500 possible local climate governance arrangements. We find that Latin American elites prefer international organizations to formulate climate policies, support imposing increasing fines on violators, and favor renewing agreements every five years. We also find that elites support both international institutions and local courts to mediate conflicts, but they distrust non-governmental organizations and reject informal norms as a means of conflict resolution.

This paper studies this relationship by using variation in property rights systems induced by historically contingent assignment of districts in North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to study their effects on modern day demographic outcomes. We find that villages where property rights were granted to the cultivators have more skewed sex-ratios, lower female literacy, and lower female labor force participation rate than villages where property rights were granted to the landlord. These findings suggest that, in contrast to the robust positive relationship between institutions and economic outcomes, economic institutions may, depending on existing social norms, ameliorate or exacerbate social inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,development|india|institutions|land-tenure|political-economy|regression-discontinuity|south-asia,2019-03-15T00:51:08.430449,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:50:23.430005,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/citation/,6vdf7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8a73158df5880017c3af57/,5c8a73158df5880017c3af57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vdf7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vdf7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vdf7

In this chapter I propose that social dilemma research, rooted in game theory, offers a rich and flexible theoretical framework for studying sharing economy interactions. I sketch applicable models that may involve trust as an important feature of many sharing economy interactions but also highlight other strategic considerations that superficially look similar to trust problems but may be understood more fruitfully by alternative models.  More specifically, I discuss various types of two-person dilemmas such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Trust Game, but also N-person dilemmas, including common pool problems, exchange systems, and club goods. Solutions to the cooperation problems implied by these dilemmas are also discussed. I conclude the chapter by sketching some promising directions for future research.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|game theory|institutions|sharing economy|social dilemmas|social exchange|trust,2019-03-15T00:49:28.816135,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:48:50.692958,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Edgar Elgar Ltd,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/citation/,cq26e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8a34f9245c0a0017d8b4b1/,5c8a34f9245c0a0017d8b4b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cq26e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cq26e/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cq26e

We leverage the data infrastructure shared by the main edX instance and one regional Open edX provider, Edraak in Jordan, to compare the experience of learners from Arab countries on both platforms. Comparing learners from Arab countries on edX to those on Edraak, the Edraak population has a more even gender balance, more learners with lower education levels, greater participation from more developing countries, higher levels of persistence and completion, and a larger total population of learners. This ""apples to apples"" comparison of MOOC learners is facilitated by an approach to multiplatform MOOC analytics, which employs parallel research processes to create joint aggregate datasets without sharing identifiable data across institutions. Our findings suggest that greater research attention should be paid towards regional MOOC providers, and regional providers may have an important role to play in expanding access to higher education.",TRUE,FALSE,Cross-institutional Collaboration|Cultural Factors|Distance Learning|Education|Large-Scale Analytics|Learning Analytics|MOOCs,2019-03-15T00:48:21.800580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T00:47:33.852128,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education,ACM,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/citation/,8j9zv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c89939e66b44d001d74951c/,5c89939e66b44d001d74951c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j9zv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8j9zv/,https://doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333616,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8j9zv
