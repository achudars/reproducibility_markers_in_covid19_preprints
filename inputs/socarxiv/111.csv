This includes third-party reporting methods, which have become increasingly common in the field of abortion measurement, where direct survey approaches notoriously lead to underreporting. This paper provides the first in-depth assessment of one of the most widely used of these techniques in the field of abortion measurement: the Confidante Method. We outline six key assumptions behind the Confidante Method and describe how violations of these assumptions can bias resulting estimates. Using data from modules added to the nationally representative Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) surveys in Uganda and Ethiopia in 2018, we compute one-year abortion incidence estimates using the Confidante Method. We also perform a validation check, using the method to estimate IUD and implant use. While our results reveal that the method performed differently in each country, there were implementation problems in both settings. Several of the method’s foundational assumptions were violated, and efforts to adjust for these violations either failed or only partially addressed the resulting bias. Our validation check also failed, resulting in a gross over-estimate of IUD and implant use. We identify substantial biases in both the numerator and denominator of our abortion estimates and challenge the continued use of this method to estimate abortion incidence. These results have implications more broadly for the potential biases that can be introduced in using third-party reporting of close ties to measure other sensitive or stigmatized behaviors.",TRUE,FALSE,abortion measurement|data quality|demography|sexual and reproductive health|social networks|third-party reporting,2021-01-13T22:49:46.827429,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T13:25:47.386958,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.pmadata.org/data,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,2021 Margaret Giorgio and Elizabeth Sully,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/citation/,54zud,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffdf50186541a03e914b9f8/,5ffdf50186541a03e914b9f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54zud/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/54zud/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/54zud,NA

These will give rise to both tensions and opportunities as the outcomes of those regional pathways interact. To navigate these multiple and diverse transitions, we need a better understanding of how local pathways interact with global processes to produce outcomes for people and nature.

We find the pandemic has generally had a more severe labor force impact on urban residents than their rural counterparts. Urban adults were more likely to be unable to work, not paid for missed hours, and be unable to look for work due to COVID-19. However, rural workers were less likely to be able to work remotely than urban workers.

Complete and high-quality data are needed to inform effective programming. To inform improvements, we examine different techniques for collecting school-based data about young people’s sexuality, relationships and partner violence.

Methods: We use empirical data from a school-based programme evaluation in Mexico City as a case study. The evaluation sought data on sexuality and relationships using self-administered questionnaires, observation, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of different data collection methods in practice, comparing data from questionnaires and interviews to examine data quality and identifying challenges to collecting and interpreting data from different methods and sources. We used descriptive statistics, reviewed field notes, and conducted thematic analysis, drawing on research team and participant perspectives. 

Results: Data collection was influenced by earthquakes and extreme weather, social aspects of the data collection setting, and the sensitive nature of the data. There was variation in data quality by group, timepoint, gender, and topic. Women had a higher proportion of complete responses than men at most timepoints. Intervention group men were the only group to increase their proportion of complete responses from baseline to endline. Items about sexual activity had the lowest proportions of complete responses. Participants varied in their willingness to share personal information. Data from different sources and timepoints sometimes appeared contradictory, creating challenges with interpretation. 

Conclusions: This analysis can inform methodological choice for school-based sexual health research.

Despite  in  substantial  contribution  of  women  to  both  household  and national  economy,  their  work  is  considered  just  an  extension  of  household  domain and  remains  non-monetized.

Prominent explanations for poor implementation emphasize bureaucratic rent-seeking and capture. This article documents a different pathology that we term bureaucratic overload: local bureaucrats are often heavily under-resourced relative to their responsibilities. We advance a two-step theory explaining why bureaucratic overload is detrimental to implementation as well as why politicians under-invest in local bureaucracy, emphasizing a lack of electoral incentives. Drawing on a nationwide survey of local rural development officials across India, including time-usage diaries that measure their daily behavior, we provide quantitative evidence that (i) officials with fewer resources are worse at implementing rural development programs, plausibly because they are unable to allocate enough time to managerial tasks and (ii) fewer resources are provided in administrative units where political responsibility for implementation is less clear. The findings shed light on the political economy and bureaucratic behavior underpinning weak local state capacity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-13T12:43:28.566792,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-12T10:24:10.106914,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/N1JX6Y,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",Aditya Dasgupta and Devesh Kapur,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/citation/,2qvwb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffccd1686541a032214aca3/,5ffccd1686541a032214aca3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qvwb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2qvwb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2qvwb,NA
