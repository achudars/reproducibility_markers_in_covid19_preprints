Under the theoretical framework of interactionism theory of conversion, which posits that the interplay between active, negotiated, and socially constructed aspects of human behavior and different aspects of social context lead to religious conversion, I propose that economic mobility and income affect whether or not one chooses to switch religions from the one in which they were raised. I rely on the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) that was administered to 2,867 randomly selected adults living in households in the United States in 2016. I analyze data from a subset of 1,068 married respondents to examine the effects of economic mobility, income, exogamy, geographic mobility, education, race, age, and sex on religious mobility and apostasy. There are no significant correlations between economic mobility and income with religious mobility or apostasy. The only significant predictor of religious mobility and apostasy is exogamy. Respondents who have married outside of the religion in which they were raised are more likely to be religiously mobile or abandon religion altogether than those who are endogamous. Additionally, older respondents are less likely to abandon religion than younger respondents. My hypothesis is not supported. However, the results support interactionism theory of conversion as exogamy is a significant predictor of religious mobility. These results confirm that the institution of marriage plays a significant role in whether or not someone converts religions; furthermore, the bonds of marriage outweigh one’s bond to the religion in which they were raised.",TRUE,FALSE,inter-religious marriage|religious conversion|religious identity,2018-07-02T11:29:51.078836,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-17T15:11:39.087765,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,Ruby Thompson,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/citation/,jx92k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b73at/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/relationships/node/,b73at,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a35eff61e3f47001086858c/,5a35eff61e3f47001086858c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jx92k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jx92k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jx92k,NA

This study asks, how does Mexican immigrant replenishment affect Spanish language use among adult US-born Mexican descendants? Descendants include members of the second or later generations. I propose that greater exposure to Mexican immigrants will encourage adult US-born Mexican descendants to maintain their ethnic origins, especially language of origin. Therefore, the higher the rate of immigrant replenishment, the more likely respondents will speak Spanish at home. I analyze a five-year cumulative data file of the US American Community Survey (ACS) from 2011 to 2015, which represents 5 percent of the US population. The ACS uses stratified cluster sampling to collect data from 15,637,457 respondents. The sample is limited to US-born Mexican descendants, who were 25 years of age, married, and heads of households or spouses thereof. This limited the analysis to 187,212 respondents. I found that college attendance and higher family income decrease the odds of speaking Spanish at home. I also found that as immigrant replenishment increases, the odds of respondents speaking Spanish at home increases and decreases. As immigrant replenishment increases, respondents with Hispanic spouses are more likely to speak Spanish at home. However, respondents with non-Hispanic spouses are less likely to speak Spanish at home, which may be a result of sharpened intragroup boundaries created by new immigrants.

The last two decades have seen a growing trend towards the research of voting behavior in post-communist countries. Urban sociology theorists state that not only space structures influence political participation, but also space structures are changing under the influence of global, local, and individual factors. The growing role played by information in the global- ised world has accelerated the paradigm shift in urban sociology: from central place model (based on urban-rural distinction and on monocentric metropolitan areas) to network soci- ety (based on space of flows and polycentric metropolitan areas). However, recent studies have mainly focused on countries with solid democracies, rather than on former communist countries. The present study aims to analyze the extent to which a new emerging spatial structure can be envisaged within a metropolitan area of Romania and its consequences for the political dimensions of social capital.
Methods
The Transilvania University Ethics Commission approved this study (S1 Aprouval). The research is based upon individual and aggregate empirical data, collected from the areas adjacent to the core city in Brașov metropolitan area. Individual data has been collected during October 2012, using the oral survey technique (S1 Survey), based on a standardised questionnaire (stratified simple random sample, N = 600). The National Institute of Statistics and the Electoral Register provided the aggregate data per locality. Unvaried and multivariate analyses (hierarchical regression method) were conducted based on these data.
Results
Some dimensions of urbanism, identified as predictors of the political dimensions of social capital, suggest that the area under analysis has a predominantly monocentric character, where the rural-urban distinction continues to remain relevant. There are also arguments favoring the dissolution of the rural-urban distinction and the emergence of polycentric spa- tial structures. The presence of some influences related to the information consumption on all six indicators of the political dimensions of social capital under analysis suggests the occurrence of emerging forms of a space of flows. The identified effects of social problems associated with transport infrastructure and of migration experience on the political dimen- sions of social capital, also support the emergence of space of flows.
Conclusions
We recommend that, in the urban studies in former communist countries, conceptualization of urbanism as predictor of the political dimensions of social capital should consider both the material dimensions of space, as well as the dimensions of information consumption and migration experience.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet|migration|polycentric metropolitan areas|post-socialist|right to the city|space of flows|spatial structures|trust in politicians|urban sprawl|voter turnout,2018-07-02T11:29:50.647469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-16T23:04:46.105367,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/citation/,4awpq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hnat7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/relationships/node/,hnat7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a358f7b1e3f47000e86832d/,5a358f7b1e3f47000e86832d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4awpq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4awpq,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144485

A considerable amount of literature has been published based on the reflexive transformation of intimacy framework. This paper starts from the premise that, recently, more and more scholars have criticized the idea that detraditionalization and individualization led to the transformation of intimacy during reflexive modernity (late modernity). Critics question the ability of late modernity concepts to offer a cross- cultural and nuanced image of contemporary particularities of private life and intimate relations. The purpose of this study is to show the current state of knowledge in the social sciences on individualization thesis and detraditionalization thesis, the main theoretical criticisms of the two theses and conceptual alternatives to them. To achieve these goals, we conducted an interpretive synthesis of 16 articles from international literature, published between 1999-2014, in the thematic area of social changes brought by late modernity into the domain of private life and intimacy. In the Introduction section, we briefly present the two theses as reflected in the two of the most cited books on these themes: The Transformations of Intimacy. Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Societies (Giddens, 1992) and The Normal Chaos of Love (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 1995). In the body of the paper, we synthesize the arguments sustaining the criticism of the two theses and show some conceptual alternatives to these criticisms, as stated in the literature. In the concluding section, we resume the main arguments to open directions for future studies.",TRUE,FALSE,detraditionalization|emocratization of intimacy|individualization|pure relationship|therapeutic culture,2018-07-02T11:29:50.602513,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-16T23:03:55.731041,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,The Authors &amp; LUMEN Publishing House,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/citation/,y6dx2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yucjk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/relationships/node/,yucjk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a358d43bd7829001066a245/,5a358d43bd7829001066a245,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y6dx2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y6dx2,https://doi.org/10.18662/po/2016.0701.03

Informed by the market transition debate, stratification theories, and intergenerational mobility studies, this study aims to examine whether under the party-state political structure, ruling party membership is a substantial exogenous source of social class stratification. Data in this study is drawn from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (n = 2,209). The ordinary least square (OLS) regression suggests that for non-institutionalized Chinese adults who are born during the reform era (1978 -2013), their parents' Chinese Communist Party membership is a statistically significant factor in determining their social class measured by their income and education, when holding constant sex, age, region, urbanity, and ethnicity.

Understanding the Relationship Between Racial Residential Segregation and Self-Reported Health,"How does context influence health? County racial composition and racial residential segregation shape health outcomes by creating different contexts that influence access to health-related resources. White Americans disproportionately possess these material and intangible resources. Therefore, I propose that the higher the percent of non-Hispanic white residents in U.S. counties, and the higher the racial residential segregation in U.S. counties, the lower the percent of adult residents who report poor or fair health in U.S. counties. To explore these hypotheses, I analyze 2014 demographic and survey data from 2946 U.S. counties. Findings provide mixed support for my hypotheses. Percent white has a significant inverse relationship with county self-reported health. Controlling for median household income, access to health insurance and primary care physicians, and rurality, the higher the percent of white residents, the lower the percent of residents reporting poor or fair health in U.S. counties. However, the dissimilarity index has no significant relationship with the dependent variable. In both models, control variables of median household income, access to health insurance and primary care physicians, and rurality are significantly linked to self-reported health. These results suggest that the control and distribution of material (economic and political) and intangible (social and cultural) resources is key to predicting health outcomes. The concentration of resources in white communities is a critical aspect of maintaining structures of institutional racism. Changing the control and distribution of these resources will be key to overcoming widespread racial health disparities and other pervasive forms of structural racial inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,health|racial inequality|racial residential segregation|residential segregation|self-reported health,2018-07-02T11:29:50.339430,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-16T14:34:48.062291,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",Abigail Gramaglia,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/citation/,9hczw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/47kz2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/relationships/node/,47kz2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a351e9d1e3f47000f861f6f/,5a351e9d1e3f47000f861f6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9hczw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9hczw,NA
