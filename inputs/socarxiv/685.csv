This remarkable change in the distribution of household income has spurred a great deal of research on the social and economic consequences of exposure to high inequality. However, the empirical record on the effects of income inequality is mixed. In this paper, we suggest that previous research has generally overlooked a simple but important pathway through which inequality might manifest in daily life: inequality shapes the ability of women to outsource domestic labor by hiring others to perform it. One important venue where such dynamics might then manifest is in time spent on housework and in particular in the time divide in housework between women of high and low socio-economic status. We combine micro-data from the 2003-2013 American Time Use Survey with area-level data on income inequality to show the class divide in housework time between women with a college degree and from high earning households and women of lower socio-economic status is wider in more unequal places. We further assess whether this gap can be explained by domestic outsourcing by combining micro-data from the 2003-2013 Consumer Expenditure Survey with area-level inequality and show that the gap in spending for household services between households of high and low socio-economic status also increases in contexts of higher inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,American Time Use Survey|Consumer Expenditure Survey|Domestic labor|Housework|Income inequality|Inequality|Outsourcing|Time-use,2018-07-02T11:05:23.970659,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-28T17:45:52.644024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/citation/,pwny5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7rs2t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/relationships/node/,7rs2t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597b77049ad5a1022d7da573/,597b77049ad5a1022d7da573,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pwny5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pwny5,NA

Research on the work–family interface has predominantly focused on conflicting roles. In contrast, this paper extends research on work–family enrichment (WFE), a positive aspect of work and gender differences in WFE in a cross-national context. Drawing upon social role theory and the culture sensitive theory on work–family enrichment, we examined gender differences in experiences of developmental WFE in a sample of service sector employees in eight European countries. In line with traditional gender roles, women reported more WFE than men. The relationship was moderated by both an objective and subjective measure of gender egalitarianism but in the opposite direction as hypothesized. The gender gap in WFE was larger in more gender-egalitarian countries, where women may be better able to transfer resources from the work domain to benefit their family role than in low egalitarian societies. National differences in labor market factors, family models and the public discourse on work–life balance mainly explain the unanticipated findings.",TRUE,FALSE,Europe|Gender inequality|International comparison|Work-family conflict|Work-family enrichment|Work-life balance,2018-07-02T11:05:23.844495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-28T15:22:05.988503,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",The authors,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/citation/,vzphs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c92mj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/relationships/node/,c92mj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597b5477594d900245393d60/,597b5477594d900245393d60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vzphs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vzphs,https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2017.1355837

This debate largely sidesteps two questions that are central to understanding the future of international order: how strong is the current Western hegemonic order and what is the likelihood that China can or will lead a successful counter-hegemonic challenge? We argue that the future of international order is shaped not only by material power but also by the distribution of identity across the great powers. We develop a constructivist account of hegemonic transition that theorizes the role of the distribution of identity in international order. In our account, hegemonic orders depend on a legitimating ideology that must be consistent with the distribution of identity at both the level of elites and masses. We map the distribution of identity across nine great powers and assess how this distribution supports the current Western neoliberal democratic hegemony. We conclude that China is unlikely to become the hegemon in the near-term. First, the present order is strongly supported by the distribution of identity in both Western states and rising powers like India and Brazil. Second, China is unlikely to join the present order and lead a transition from within because its authoritarian identity conflicts with the democratic ideology of the present order. Finally, China is unlikely to lead a counter-hegemonic coalition of great powers because it will be difficult to build an appealing, universal ideology consistent with the identities of other great powers.",TRUE,FALSE,American decline|China|discourse|discourse analysis|distribution of identity|hegemonic transition|hegemony|international order|national identity,2018-07-02T11:05:23.424033,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-27T03:48:58.744839,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Bentley Allan|Srdjan Vucetic and Ted Hopf,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/citation/,f8hwe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v3kta/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/relationships/node/,v3kta,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597961199ad5a1023a58e8ba/,597961199ad5a1023a58e8ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f8hwe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f8hwe,NA

Anecdotal evidence about the meaning of the term suggests that a mix of both accurate data and misinformation can abound.  We sought to uncover what range of meanings the term ‘undetectable’ holds for a cohort of HIV testers at a free HIV testing facility along mid-Market St, San Francisco.
Design:  A four question survey with additional demographic questions was administered to 130 individuals at the testing site.  The resulting answers were then coded as ‘informed’, ‘uninformed’, or ‘misinformed’ and correlated with demographic measures, including residential zip code of the respondent.
Results: Residents in the Castro district were most likely to associate ‘undetectable’ status with medication adherence.  The most misinformed zip code with respect to the meaning and implications of the term ‘undetectable’ was the Tenderloin, which corresponds to the San Francisco zip code with the lowest rates of HIV suppression. Compared to MSMs, heterosexuals were the most uninformed; while racially, Asians were the most misinformed and Blacks the least misinformed.  Older men seem most cautious about using ‘undetectable’ as a risk-reduction strategy.
Significance: The study highlights the degree to which certain neighbourhoods and demographics have assimilated the concept of ‘undetectable’ and how viral suppression is maintained, while pinpointing neighbourhoods for additional outreach to correct identified misinformation.",TRUE,FALSE,adherence|ARV|Castro|getting to zero|HIV|MSM|San Francisco|Tenderloin|undetectable|viral load|viral suppression,2018-07-02T11:05:23.298421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-26T19:50:36.525856,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/citation/,8xutp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8v9up/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/relationships/node/,8v9up,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5978f1949ad5a1023857c933/,5978f1949ad5a1023857c933,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xutp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xutp,NA

Neighbourhood context and trust in the police in Northern Ireland,"The association between trust in the police and neighbourhood-level factors such as deprivation, disorder and social cohesion is well established. As an embodiment of the effort to reproduce normative social order, the police garner trust when community settings are perceived as orderly, cohesive and well-functioning.  Conversely, trust is undermined when order and cohesion seem attenuated or under threat. Yet, little attention has been paid to the association between neighbourhood diversity and trust in the police. Allport’s contact hypothesis suggests that because diversity increases intergroup contact and thus a sense of cohesion, it may promote trust in the police. In this paper we use data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2014, combined with Census and other local-area data, to explore the association between ethno-religious diversity and trust in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. We find that trust is higher in more diverse areas, primarily because Catholics living in such areas report significantly higher levels of trust than their counterparts living in less diverse areas. We interpret these results in light of what policing means in contemporary Northern Ireland and consider the implications for attempts to enhance police-community trust in segregated and divided societies more generally.",TRUE,FALSE,collective efficacy|ethnic diversity|Northern lreland|policing|trust,2018-07-02T11:05:23.207191,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-26T16:14:22.317812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/citation/,7546d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/42ndv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/relationships/node/,42ndv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5978bf3bb83f69022931c8c5/,5978bf3bb83f69022931c8c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7546d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7546d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7546d,NA

The focus of the current study is on the notion of bounded authority – i.e. acting within the limits of one’s rightful authority.  According to work on legal socialization, US citizens come to acquire three dimensions of values that determine how authorities ought to behave: (a) neutral, consistent and transparent decision-making; (b) interpersonal treatment that conveys respect, dignity and concern; and (c) respecting the limits of one’s rightful power. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of US adults, we show that concerns over bounded authority, respectful treatment, and neutral decision-making combine to form a strong predictor of police and legal legitimacy. We also find that legal legitimacy is associated with greater compliance behavior, controlling for personal morality and perceived likelihood of sanctions.

While the Axial Age concept is well-known and influential, deficiencies in the historical evidence and sociological analysis available have thwarted efforts to evaluate the Axial Age concept’s major global contentions. As a result, the Axial Age concept remains controversial. Seshat: Global History Databank provides new tools for examining this topic in social formations across Afro-Eurasia during the first two millennia BCE and first millennium CE, allowing scholars to empirically evaluate the many varied— and contrasting—claims put forward about this period. Our systematic investigation undercuts the notion of a specific 'age' of axiality limited to a specific geo-temporal localization. Critical traits offered as evidence of an axial transformation by proponents of the Axial Age concept are shown to have appeared across Afro-Eurasia hundreds and in some cases thousands of years prior to the proposed Axial Age. Our analysis raises important questions for future evaluations of this period and points the way towards empirically-led, historical-sociological investigations of the ideological and institutional foundations of complex societies.",TRUE,FALSE,Axial Age|Ethics|historical sociology|Modernity|Moralizing Religions|Religion|Social Change,2018-07-02T11:05:22.758314,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-25T21:02:21.575988,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/citation/,r9czx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u6tsd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/relationships/node/,u6tsd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5977afb79ad5a10238573a4d/,5977afb79ad5a10238573a4d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9czx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r9czx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r9czx,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122418772567

Key to the theory are two points: (a) that “common knowledge” lies may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling; and (b) that when a political system is suffering from a “crisis of legitimacy” (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency, members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests. Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is perceived, and that several oft-discussed factors—information-access, culture, language, and gender—are not necessary for explaining such differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal, it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political system as flawed or illegitimate.",TRUE,FALSE,Authenticity|Demagogue|Elections|Lying|Political Sociology|Presidential Politics,2018-07-02T11:05:22.413672,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-25T16:06:27.771713,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Oliver Hahl|Minjae Kim|Ezra W.

We conducted a résumé audit study to examine the effect of social class signals on entry into large U.S. law firms. We sent applications from fictitious students at selective but non-elite law schools to 316 law firm offices in 14 cities, randomly assigning signals of social class background and gender to otherwise identical résumés. Higher-class male applicants received significantly more callbacks than did higher-class women, lower-class women, and lower-class men. A survey experiment and interviews with lawyers at large firms suggest that, relative to lower-class applicants, higher-class candidates are seen as better fits with the elite culture and clientele of large law firms. But, although higher-class men receive a corresponding overall boost in evaluations, higher-class women do not, because they face a competing, negative stereotype that portrays them as less committed to full-time, intensive careers. This commitment penalty faced by higher-class women offsets class-based advantages these applicants may receive in evaluations.

the United States. Pairs of fictitious résumés were sent in response to 1,769 job postings in seven
states. One résumé in each pair was randomly assigned experience in a gay campus organization,
and the other résumé was assigned a control organization. Two main findings have emerged.
First, in some but not all states, there was significant discrimination against the fictitious
applicants who appeared to be gay. This geographic variation in the level of discrimination
appears to reflect regional differences in attitudes and anti-discrimination laws. Second,
employers who emphasized the importance of stereotypically male heterosexual traits were
particularly likely to discriminate against openly gay men. Beyond these particular findings, this
study advances the audit literature more generally by covering multiple regions and by
highlighting how audit techniques may be used to identify stereotypes that affect employment
decisions in real labor markets.",TRUE,FALSE,Anti-discrimination law|Attitudes|Audit Study|Discrimination|Gay|Labor Markets|LGBT|Sexual Orientation|Stereotypes|Work and Occupations,2018-07-02T11:03:35.388597,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-24T10:56:12.543741,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/citation/,j9ybs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/awxkd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/relationships/node/,awxkd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5975d0a96c613b022837ec63/,5975d0a96c613b022837ec63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ybs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9ybs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9ybs,https://doi.org/10.1086/661653
