I propose a new method of identifying couples who live apart in the American Community Survey and use the method to construct the first nationally representative sample of matched noncohabiting husbands and wives. Consistent with previous research, I find that husbands' education has a larger impact than wives' on the probability that couples migrate together. In contrast, wives' education has a larger impact on the probability that couples live apart.

I find that non-cohabitation is unusual but not unknown among highly educated workers; the prevalence of non-cohabitation among all college-educated workers was 1.9 percent, and the prevalence was as high as 2.8 percent for women and 4.2 percent for men under 30. Consistent with the idea that some couples live apart to solve a dual-career location problem, I also find that non-cohabitation is more common among workers with higher levels of education and workers in occupations with high degrees of geographic clustering.

This study investigated how personality traits are related to compliance with environmental regulation in agriculture. The object of study was a water-protection rule that required farmers using fertilising to keep it a minimum distance away from nearby water bodies. Self-interested infringements can cause serious environmental damage to waters (negative externalities) through nitrogen runoff. In a survey among German farmers, we employed a 10-item version of the Big Five Inventory to measure the traits that are used as predictor variables in a regression analysis. The outcome variable was the farmers’ compliance behaviour in a business management game where rule-breaking was more profitable than rule-abidance. Some noteworthy findings were observed in the surveyed sample. (i) Neuroticism was positively related to ‘overall compliance’, measured as a binary yes/no variable; that is, more anxious farmers were less prone to rule-breaking. Surprisingly, however, a positive relationship between neuroticism and compliance was not found when looking separately at the deviant subgroup; here, greater neuroticism was associated with more severe rule violations, in terms of illicitly fertilised acreage. (ii) In the deviant subgroup, as might have been expected, higher levels of conscientiousness were associated with less severe rule-violations. Contrary to expectations, again, higher levels of agreeableness were linked to more severe non-compliance. A substantial positive relationship was found between extraversion and the severity of non-compliance, in accordance with ex-ante expectation. For openness to experience, no noteworthy results were obtained. The results indicate that agents with heterogeneous personality traits might react differently to identical economic and institutional environments. Moreover, it is suggested that, other than traits, there is another quality in agents (e.g. social control) that may have a decisive influence on their belonging to the compliant or non-compliant subpopulation. Farmers’ responses to changes brought forward by regulators who aim to prevent rule-breaking might therefore differ as well.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioural psychology|Big Five|environmental protection|nitrogen runoff|non-compliance|personality psychology,2019-04-12T16:45:28.572965,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-12T16:44:58.229745,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c64|Law|Agriculture Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/citation/,jnexr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb0aabf39926900180f4785/,5cb0aabf39926900180f4785,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jnexr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jnexr,NA

Second, in combined elections, one electoral arena affects the other. In our case of majoritarian executive elections concurrent to proportional representation (PR) legislative elections, the centripetal tendency of majoritarian elections colors off to the concurrent PR race. Third, concurrency also entails spillovers of the incumbency advantage of executive officeholders to the concurrent legislative race. Drawing on quasi-random variation in local election timing in Germany, we show that concurrency increases turnout as well as council votes for the incumbent mayor’s party and centrist parties more generally, with slightly more pronounced gains for the political left.

The reason why writing can be hard to learn is that writers face many challenges the moment they start writing. The challenges could be from gathering the ideas to be written, planning of the outline, focusing on sentence structure, choosing the appropriate expressions, and also making sure of the organization. Moreover, these challenges can cause students to have negative attitudes towards writing. Previous studies suggest that using writing strategies can help student control the writing process which have a positive effect on their writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing. The strategy of mind mapping is used as a pre-writing strategy to help writers visualize the structure of their writing. However, the researcher proposes using mind mapping strategy not only to organize ideas, but also to organize grammatical and linguistic knowledge. This study investigates the effect of using this mind mapping strategy as a pre-writing strategy to enhance female language learners’ writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing in English at Taif University, Saudi Arabia. In a quasi-experimental design, a mixed methods approach was adopted by collecting quantitative and qualitative data. The study population is 128 students in an experimental group (n1= 57) and a control group (n2=71). The former received the treatment of instruction using mind mapping strategy and the latter received traditional instruction. The objectives of this study are first, to identify any differences between the mean scores of the experimental group and the control group on post-tests of writing attitudes and writing achievement; second, to identify differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of writing attitudes and writing achievement for the experimental group; third, to explore students' views concerning difficulties to write in English. fourth, to identify the strategies they used to overcome these difficulties; fifth, to investigate if students thought that mind mapping helped them write better and, if so, how. The researcher prepared a test to measure the writing achievement of female first-year EFL students, and a questionnaire by Sturm (1996) to measure writing attitudes. An interview was conducted with a focus group from the experimental group to achieve the third, fourth and fifth objectives. Independent samples and paired sample t-tests were performed to quantitively analyze data from the writing achievement test and the writing attitudes questionnaire. Data collected from the interview were qualitatively analyzed. The finding of the current study are first, there exists differences between the mean scores of the experimental and the control group on the post-tests of the students` writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of the experimental group; second there exists significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group’s pre- and post-tests in writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of the post-test; third, students’ difficulties to write in English include lack of vocabulary, organization, spelling and grammar; fourth, students are accustomed to memorizing, practicing, and self-correcting, which indicates they are not used to planning their writing; finally, students also positively perceived the strategy of mind mapping and thought it helped them to better write in English.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|EFL|freshman students|mind mapping|writing achievement,2019-07-19T19:18:23.440541,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:17:53.445629,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/citation/,r4ybf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cafaf3039926900190cfde9/,5cafaf3039926900190cfde9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r4ybf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r4ybf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.232

However, in Saudi Arabia, students have difficulties learning English, especially those taught with traditional teacher-centered methods. In contrast, in the constructivist and cooperative learning methods, textbooks and teachers are no longer the only sources of information; their primary task is facilitating interaction among students and connecting students’ prior knowledge with new information. The present study investigates the effects of using the 5Es teaching model on EFL female students’ motivation and achievement at Taif University. Likewise, it may contribute to the literature on the 5Es model with EFL students’ motivation and achievement. The sample included 119 female Saudi undergraduate students studying English as a foreign language (EFL) at the first level at Taif University, in Saudi Arabia.  They study English language with a focus on reading, writing, listening and speaking, for 6 hours weekly over one academic semester. The sample was divided into a control group (n = 61) and an experimental group (n = 58). Two research questions were addressed to examine whether: (1) there are significant differences between the experimental group scores and the control group scores on post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement and (2) there are significant differences between the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’ motivation and their achievement for the experimental group. The researcher designed a program incorporating the 5Es model of teaching and learning which was used with the experimental group for ten weeks in 20 sessions. The 5Es model program provides the basis for learners to construct an accurate understanding of a new concept based on existing knowledge. In contrast, the researcher used traditional instruction with the control group for the same period. Besides the 5Es program, the two groups were asked to answer questions on a 5-point Likert-scale motivation questionnaire before and after the instruction to compare changes on students’ motivation.  The following statistics calculations were performed: t-test, mean, SD, and Pearson coefficient correlations to analyze the data. The results showed that there are significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental and control groups on the post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement in favor of the experimental group. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found in the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’ motivation and their achievement for the experimental group, in favor of post-test.",TRUE,FALSE,5Es model|achievement|EFL female Saudi students|motivation|training program,2019-07-19T19:11:42.375119,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:11:15.369498,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/citation/,3cbek,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cafae4aa3bc970019eda394/,5cafae4aa3bc970019eda394,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3cbek/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3cbek,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.231

The study principally aimed to highlight the strategies used by the translator to overcome the problem of no equivalence in the target language. Baker's strategies for translating idioms (1992) formed the basis of the theoretical part of the study. The analytical part comprised Agatha Christie's novel, Appointment with Death (2001) and the translation of the novel by Ameen from English into Arabic. The study concentrated on the most dominant translation solutions when translating idioms from English into Arabic. A lack of equivalent idioms in the Arabic language was one of the outcomes of this study. Further investigations showed that the most prevailing translation strategy used by the translator encompassed paraphrasing. The translated version highlighted the challenges of switching between different cultural, conceptual and linguistic frames of reference.",TRUE,FALSE,idioms|source language|strategies of translation idioms. target language,2019-07-18T23:31:21.934674,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-18T23:31:00.846197,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/citation/,t8z9g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cafad4439926900160cdda1/,5cafad4439926900160cdda1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8z9g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t8z9g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t8z9g,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.230
