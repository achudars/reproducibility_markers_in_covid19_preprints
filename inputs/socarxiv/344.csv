From our framework, one can derive both a narrow definition of the gig economy as ex ante specified, paid tasks carried out by independent contractors mediated by online platforms, and broader definitions that include offline next to online intermediation, employees next to independent contractors, unpaid tasks next to paid tasks, and asset sharing next to performing gigs. The four dimensions also span four key regulatory questions: how should online platforms be classified and regulated, how should gig workers be classified and regulated, what should count as paid and unpaid work, and should we treat earnings from performing gigs different from earnings from sharing assets. We conclude that the positions taken on these regulatory issues are essentially contingent upon political choices, which will determine how the gig economy will evolve in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,gig economy|labour|pay|platform economy|regulation|sharing economy,2020-01-07T23:00:21.893145,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-07T23:00:03.389245,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Nikos Koutsimpogiorgos|Jaap van Slageren|Andrea Herrmann|Koen Frenken,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/citation/,jmqyt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e13568857341901c3805d19/,5e13568857341901c3805d19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmqyt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jmqyt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jmqyt,NA

On the one hand, because individuals in similar field positions are also imposed with similar cultural orientations, cultural homophily reproduces ‘objective’ field structure in intersubjective social network ties. On the other hand, fields are operative in practice and to accomplish pragmatic goals individuals who occupy different field positions often join in groups, creatively reinterpret the field-imposed cultural orientations, and produce cultural similarities alternative to the position-specific ones. Drawing on these emergent similarities, the cultural homophily mechanism might stimulate social network ties between members who occupy not the same but different field positions, thus contesting fields. I examine this ambivalent role of cultural homophily in two creative collectives, each embracing members positioned closer to the opposite poles of the field of cultural production. I find different types of cultural similarities to affect different types of social network ties within and between the field positions: Similarity of vocabularies stimulates friendship and collaboration ties within positions, thus reproducing the field, while affiliation with the same cultural structures stimulates collaboration ties between positions, thus contesting the field. The latter effect is visible under statistical analysis of ethnographic data, but easy to oversee in qualitative analysis of texts because informants tend to flag conformity to their positions in their explicit statements. This highlights the importance of mixed socio-semantic network analysis, both sensitive to the local context and capable of unveiling the mechanisms underlying the interplay between the cultural and the social.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural structure|field|mixed method|practice|small group|socio-semantic network,2020-01-06T20:45:25.110816,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-06T20:44:24.373938,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/citation/,wjvmq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e128d687545840175f9b7b8/,5e128d687545840175f9b7b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjvmq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wjvmq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wjvmq,NA

Unlike typical approaches where sociologists investigate environmental inequality as it exists in the present, climate change hazards are known to compound over time, worsening in the future. Although the current demographic characteristics of the U.S. are known, here we account for the anticipated demographic changes likely to occur this century that could substantially compound climate inequality in the U.S. We use sea-level rise as an example of compounding environmental risk to uncover the magnitude of future inequalities. Specifically, we analyze how climate change may amplify inequalities in the future by disproportionately impacting presently vulnerable groups (e.g., by race, sex, and age). We find that communities of color and the elderly will face intensified impacts of sea-level rise by the end of the century. These processes of environmental inequality formation would go undetected using current, rather than projected, demographic data. Our results suggest climate change will continue to develop as a source of inequality this century and beyond, transmitting inequality across time and saddling future generations with environmental and social disadvantage. Our results, therefore, represent an important new approach to predict inequality formation in the distant future.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|demographic shift|environmental justice|racial inequality|sea level rise|vulnerable populations,2020-01-06T04:18:23.022561,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-06T04:18:06.692126,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/citation/,7jtrn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1232e3573419014b806271/,5e1232e3573419014b806271,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtrn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jtrn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jtrn,NA

Studies to date primarily focus on cultural similarities in interpersonal dyads driven by principles such as homophily and contagion. We aim to extend these principles for socio-cultural networks and investigate potentially competing micro-principles that generate these networks, taking into account not only direct dyadic overlap between interpersonal ties and cultural structures, but also the indirect interplay between the social and the cultural. 
Methodology: The empirical analysis utilizes social and semantic network data gathered through ethnographic studies of five creative organizations around Europe. We apply exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for multiplex networks to model the simultaneous operation of several generative principles of socio-cultural structuring yielding multiplex dyads and triads that combine interpersonal ties with meaning sharing links. 
Findings: The results suggest that in addition to the direct overlap of shared meanings and interpersonal ties, socio-cultural structure formation is also affected by extra-dyadic links. Namely, expressive interpersonal ties with common third persons condition meaning sharing between individuals, while meaning sharing with common alters leads to interpersonal collaborations. Beyond dyads, the dual ordering of the social and the cultural thus operates as asymmetrical with regard to different types of interpersonal ties. 
Research implications: The paper shows that in addition to direct dyadic overlap, network ties with third parties play an important role for the co-constitution of the social and the cultural. Moreover, we highlight that the concept of network multiplexity can be extended beyond its application social networks to investigate competing micro-principles guiding the interplay of social and cultural structures.",TRUE,FALSE,creative organization|exponential random graph model|semantic network|social and cultural duality|social network,2020-01-06T20:48:02.538431,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-06T20:46:33.913489,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/citation/,xpf76,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e122c43573419014b805bf0/,5e122c43573419014b805bf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpf76/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xpf76/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xpf76,NA

Prominent political institutions crafted principles for the ‘ethical being’ of the AI companies while tech giants were documenting ethics in a series of self-written guidelines. In parallel, a large community started to flourish, focusing on how to technically embed ethical parameters into algorithmic systems. Founded upon the philosophical work of Simone de Beauvoir and JeanPaul Sartre, this paper explores the philosophical antinomies of the ‘AI Ethics’ debate as well as the conceptual disorientation of the ‘fairness discussion’. By bringing the philosophy of existentialism to the dialogue, this paper attempts to challenge the dialectical monopoly of utilitarianism and sheds fresh light on the -already glaring- AI arena. Why is ‘the AI Ethics guidelines’ a futile battle doomed to dangerous abstraction? How this battle can harm our sense of collective freedom? Which is the uncomfortable reality that remains obscured by the smokegas of the ‘AI Ethics’ discussion? And eventually, what’s the alternative?

For decades, redlining limited access to homeownership and wealth creation among racial minorities, contributing to a host of adverse social outcomes, including high unemployment, poverty, and residential vacancy, that persist today. While the multigenerational socioeconomic impacts of redlining are increasingly understood, the impacts on urban environments and ecosystems remains unclear. To begin to address this gap, we investigated how the HOLC policy administered 80 years ago may relate to present-day tree canopy at the neighborhood level. Urban trees provide many ecosystem services, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and may improve quality of life in cities. In our prior research in Baltimore, MD, we discovered that redlining policy influenced the location and allocation of trees and parks. Our analysis of 37 metropolitan areas here shows that areas formerly graded D, which were mostly inhabited by racial and ethnic minorities, have on average ~23% tree canopy cover today.

This makes the expected moral value of space colonization immense. However, colonizing space also creates risks --- risks whose potential harm could easily overshadow all the benefits of humankind's long-term future. In this article, I present a preliminary overview of some major risks of space colonization: Prioritization risks, aberration risks, and conflict risks. Each of these risk types contains risks that can create enormous disvalue; in some cases orders of magnitude more disvalue than all the potential positive value humankind could have. From a (weakly) negative, suffering-focused utilitarian view, we therefore have the obligation to mitigate space colonization-related risks and make space colonization as safe as possible. In order to do so, we need to start working on real-world space colonization governance. Given the near total lack of progress in the domain of space governance in recent decades, however, it is uncertain whether meaningful space colonization governance can be established in the near future, and before it is too late.",TRUE,FALSE,existential risk|risk|space colonization,2020-01-04T18:14:01.424129,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-04T18:13:45.138201,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/citation/,hj4f2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e10499e7545840100f9a0f7/,5e10499e7545840100f9a0f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hj4f2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hj4f2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2020.102638

My analysis of the textual and visual components of these advertisements was largely informed by the work of Roland Barthes’s 1957 collection of essays, Mythologies. Taking a Barthesian approach to a discourse analysis of advertisements proved helpful in learning how to codify mythological significations for specific ads and the larger magazine’s overall thematic.",TRUE,FALSE,advertisements|discourse analysis|Gender|gender in ads|myth|visual analysis,2020-01-03T20:38:01.025204,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-03T20:37:39.420529,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d05|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Women's Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies",Jules Ostro,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/citation/,bh6z2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/egrcd/,egrcd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0fa40057341900f48070f7/,5e0fa40057341900f48070f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh6z2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bh6z2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bh6z2,NA
