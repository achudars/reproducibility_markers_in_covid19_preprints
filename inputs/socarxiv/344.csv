Regarding job search, the stigmatized unemployed
are more likely to expect that their chances of re-employment are low, but in contrast, they are more likely to place a high value on becoming re-employed. Instead of becoming discouraged and passive, we find that stigmatized unemployed

Comparative decomposition analysis of mortality data, 2000-02 to 2015-17","Background
Annual gains in life expectancy in Scotland were slower in recent years than in the previous two decades. This analysis investigates how deaths in different age groups and from different causes have contributed to annual average change in life expectancy across two time periods: 2000-02 to 2012-14 and 2012-14 to 2015-17.  

Methods
Life expectancy at birth was calculated from death and population counts, disaggregated by five-year age-group and by underlying cause of death. Arriaga’s method of life expectancy decomposition was applied to produce estimates of the contribution of different age-groups and underlying causes to changes in life expectancy at birth  for the two periods.

Findings
Average annual life expectancy gains between 2012-14 to 2015-17  were markedly smaller than in the earlier period. Almost all age-groups saw worsening mortality trends, which deteriorated for most cause of death groups between 2012-14 and 2015-17. In particular, the previously observed substantial life expectancy gains due to reductions in mortality from circulatory causes, which most benefited those aged 55-84 years, more than halved. Mortality rates for those aged 30-54 years and 90+ years worsened, due in large part to increases in drug-related deaths, and dementia and Alzheimer’s disease respectively. 

Interpretation
Future research should seek to explain the changes in mortality trends for all age-groups and causes. More investigation is required to establish to what extent shortcomings in the social security system and public services may be contributing to the adverse trends and preventing mitigation of the impact of other contributing factors, such as influenza outbreaks.",TRUE,FALSE,decomposition|life expectancy|mortality|scotland,2019-07-15T13:31:03.181891,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-15T13:30:12.472128,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/citation/,q8rme,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2c450f114a42001609218f/,5d2c450f114a42001609218f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q8rme/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q8rme,NA

Effectively, the present study attempts to answer three main research questions, namely 1. Can rule-based phonology provide a satisfactory account of non-assimilatory processes such as epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic?  2. Can a syllable-devoid account of epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic be satisfactory? 3. Is the syllable indispensable in accounting for epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic? Indeed, the present study demonstrates that a syllable-devoid analysis provides unsatisfactory accounts of certain phonological epenthesis and deletion. In order to attain the aim of this study, instances of epenthesis and deletion in the Mostaganem spoken variety of Algerian Arabic are analysed. Such instances of epenthesis and deletion were obtained from the recorded speech of a randomly selected sample of fifty native speakers of Mostaganem Spoken Arabic. The findings of this study reveal the indispensability of the syllable in describing and explaining epenthesis and deletion in MTG by comparing a syllable-devoid account and a syllable-based account of such processes. Effectively, syllable-devoid account pertaining to The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky&amp;Halle, 1968) tradition proved short of explanations as to why epenthesis and deletion take place in Mostaganem spoken Arabic as contrasted to a syllable-based account which provides adequate and convincing explanations of those processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Account|deletion|epenthesis|Mostaganem Spoken Arabic|phonological processes|syllable|The Sound Pattern of English,2019-07-18T16:01:21.396168,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-18T16:01:02.847062,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/citation/,e9k7z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf4b345253a001c41cb1c/,5d2bf4b345253a001c41cb1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e9k7z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e9k7z,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.32

Pedagogical practices and related quality assurance mechanisms regulated by such approaches limit students’ ability to be original and skeptical in reflecting upon various issues of importance and concern based on their own thinking and experiences. Such a focus, in Sivasubramaniam’s (2015) and Nunn and Sivasubramaniam’s (2011) view, has entirely centered on bureaucratic efficiency aimed at having a uniform curriculum for the majority of the students and a scheme of research and evaluation based on recalls, think-alouds, cloze tests and multiple-choice questions in standardized texts. In line with the socially-aligned view of competence much needed spontaneity, flexibility, and diversity accrues only through a process-centered pedagogy of voice, agency and response. In the backdrop of this as a premise, this paper aims to demonstrate how Critical Thinking (CT) can be promoted in EIL classrooms as a discursive practice that could shape students’ voice, agency and inter-subjectivity in a cohesive framework. The paper shares both theoretical and practical ideas about CT and its importance in facilitating a meaningful education and aims to demonstrate some innovative tasks and activities that could be exploited to shape student’s voice and agency and develop their higher order CT skills. The paper culminates in evolving a practically viable prototype pedagogical framework for promoting CT as a social practice in EIL classrooms that is capable of making Wilga River’s (1983) notions of ‘skill-getting’ and ‘skill-using’ a reality. Such a model will be useful for EIL practitioners in designing similar lessons with innovative tasks and activities and make the EIL class atmosphere stimulating and pedagogically more fruitful.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-21T21:31:22.596259,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:30:55.761038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/citation/,ak2bu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf3f6114a420019065d5c/,5d2bf3f6114a420019065d5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ak2bu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ak2bu,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.31

Additionally, it also attempts to explore and shed some light on the relationship between the two domains: pragmatics and literature in order to reveal their commonalities. There exists a strong assumption that these have something in common as they both have to do with language users and how meaning is conveyed. Despite the fact the various pragmatic approaches including speech act theory, conversational implicature, politeness theory and relevance theory are developed mainly in relation to spoken interactions, the study has revealed that they offer invaluable insights to the study of literary texts. Moreover, the process of analyzing literary texts has led to the development and the explanation of the pragmatic approaches themselves.",TRUE,FALSE,context|literary pragmatics|literature|narrator|readers,2019-07-21T21:31:54.948752,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:31:18.384723,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/citation/,nsfxe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf32d114a420019065d06/,5d2bf32d114a420019065d06,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsfxe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nsfxe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nsfxe,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.30

Specifically, the objectives are to identify which categories of IMDMs are predominant in Arabic patent abstract and to explain how metadiscourse markers function in these abstracts. To achieve these objectives, data were analyzed quantitatively to count the frequency of IMDMs, and qualitatively to examine the functions of these markers within Arabic patent abstracts based on Hyland’s model (2005). The results indicate that boosters, hedges and attitude markers are the most frequently employed markers while the remaining categories show a low frequency of occurrence. Moreover, the analysis also reveals that IMDMs fulfill different functions, such as providing data in a truthful manner, avoiding commitment to precise figures and persuasion among others. The findings of this research are useful for Arabic-speaking drafters and novice inventors for a better understanding of IMDMs commonly applied in their patent abstracts. A better understanding of the pragmatic functions of IMDMs can improve not only patent drafting skills, but also the chance for successful patent grants. It is recommended that future research investigate IMDMs within other patent sections such as claims, description, and background among different disciplines in order to achieve better insights of the use of such rhetorical metadiscourse features.",TRUE,FALSE,Abstract section|Arabic|interactional resources|metadiscourse markers|patent,2019-07-21T21:30:53.913519,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:30:32.918417,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/citation/,agkmf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf22b114a42001608d88c/,5d2bf22b114a42001608d88c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/agkmf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/agkmf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/agkmf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.29
