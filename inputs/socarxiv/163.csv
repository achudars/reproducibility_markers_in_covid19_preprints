We apply threat-rigidity theory to examine the relationship between risk framing and business model adaptation. We also investigate if emotionality has explanatory value for how managers adapt to business models. We test our hypotheses in a field experiment involving 134 Scandinavian managers. Here, we relate managers’ inclinations to adapt to different business models to different risk scenarios. The results reveal that, in general, managers are more risk seeking in gain scenarios than in loss scenarios. This finding is in line with the threat-rigidity theory. Emotionality was found to relate more to risk aversion than to risk seeking in the domain of potential gain. We argue that emotionality has explanatory value for how managers adapt to business models, because emotions are key influences on risk perception.",TRUE,FALSE,business model|emotion|framing|prospect theory|risk perception|threat-rigidity theory,2020-06-29T04:19:38.547847,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-29T04:19:12.467266,FALSE,NA,no,Please take contact with the first author in order to get access to the data,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,Camilla Aarøen and Marcus Selart,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/citation/,5qxnb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef8fcc902d64d011d6c350d/,5ef8fcc902d64d011d6c350d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qxnb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5qxnb/,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3594505,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5qxnb

Although MHLW provides a summary statistics about the COVID-19 cases and deaths on their webpage,  the distribution broken down by age and sex is not available, that leads many volunteering organizations to collect COVID-19 information based on prefectural/municipality reports.

One potential limitation we noted is that, because words associated with opposing concepts will be located close to one another in the embedding space, documents will likely have similar closeness to starkly opposing concepts (e.g., ""life"" and ""death"").

This study examines perceptions of bots with partisan personas by conducting an online experiment (N = 656) that examines the ability to differentiate bots from humans on Twitter. We explore how characteristics of the experiment participants and the profiles being evaluated bias recognition accuracy. Our analysis reveals asymmetrical partisan-motivated reasoning, in that conservative profiles appear to be more confusing and Republican participants perform less well in the recognition task. Moreover, Republican users are more likely to confuse conservative bots with humans, whereas Democratic users are more likely to confuse conservative human users with bots.

This digital revolution is empowering societies. It opens new, effective, and scalable services for governments and the private sector. It provides us with a more adaptive, data-driven approach to decision making in many aspects of our life. The digitalisation is particularly relevant for developing countries, as they can seize the opportunity for leapfrogging in order to become part of the global digitalised economy. With the example of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this work illustrates how openly available online data can be used to identify, monitor, and visualise trends in digital economic development.

Using a large and population-based data of younger and middle-aged Finns, we test how childhood co-residence duration and maternal perinatal association (MPA) correlate with contact frequency, emotional closeness and provision of help between adult siblings. Employing sibling fixed-effect models we find that duration of co-residence in childhood and MPA are indeed associated with increased relationship quality in all three measures. Provided MPA, sibling relationship quality is high independent of co-residence length, but in the absence of MPA, increased co-residence duration is associated with better relationship quality. Co-residence duration is more strongly associated with provision of help in same-gender than opposite-gender sibling dyads. Full siblings report better relationship quality than half siblings do, although the co-residence duration mediates the effect of genetic relatedness in emotional closeness between full and maternal half siblings and in provision of help between full and paternal half siblings. Moreover, MPA serves as a mediator in the case of contact frequency and emotional closeness between full and maternal half siblings. These findings are discussed with reference to key theories of kin detection.",TRUE,FALSE,Contact frequency|co-residence duration|emotional closeness|helping|kin detection|maternal perinatal association|siblings,2020-06-27T13:59:02.026111,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-27T13:58:39.144329,FALSE,NA,no,"At a later stage of the research process, access to data will be provided via the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (www.fsd.tuni.fi/en/).
