This study investigates if, and how, adoption of infants increased child mortality risks compared to non-adopted children. Moreover, it goes further than existing studies by investigating if, and how, after adoption, household composition and regional context influenced child mortality risks of these adopted children in Taiwan during the period 1906-1945. It uses the Taiwan Historical Household Register Database to answer these questions, estimating univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. The study demonstrates that child mortality risks of both male and female adopted children were much higher compared to non-adopted children. After adoption, household composition was especially important for adopted girls. In particular, similarly aged siblings increased child mortality risks of girls, indicating that the adoptees suffered the consequences of a reallocation of resources. The negative effect of infant adoption on child mortality was the same in all regional contexts.

Rather than picking stocks, index funds replicate stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500. But where do these indices actually come from? This paper analyzes the politico-economic role of index providers, a small group of highly profitable firms including MSCI, S&amp;P DJI, and FTSE Russell, and develops a research agenda from an IPE perspective. We argue that these index providers have become actors that exercise growing private authority as they steer investments through the indices they create and maintain. While technical expertise is a precondition, their brand is the primary source of index provider authority, which is entrenched through network externalities. Rather than a purely technical exercise, constructing indices is inherently political. Which companies or countries are included into an index or excluded (i.e. receive investment in- or outflows) is based on criteria defined by index providers, thereby setting standards for corporate governance and investor access. Hence, in this new age of passive asset management index providers are becoming gatekeepers that exert de facto regulatory power and thus may have important effects on corporate governance and the economic policies of countries.",TRUE,FALSE,capital flows|index funds|index providers|passive asset management|private authority|stock market indices,2019-11-20T12:25:03.872419,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-20T12:24:40.298845,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/citation/,whb75,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd3ae461d56d2000cde5a66/,5dd3ae461d56d2000cde5a66,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whb75/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/whb75/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/whb75

Progress has been limited by the availability of quantitative data to test competing theories, by divergent ideas regarding both predictor and outcomes variables, and by differences of opinion over methodology. To address all these problems, we utilize Seshat: Global History Databank, a large storehouse of information designed to test theories concerning the evolutionary drivers of social complexity in world history. In addition to the Big Gods hypothesis, which proposes that moralizing religion contributed to the success of increasingly large-scale complex societies, we consider the role of warfare, animal husbandry, and agricultural productivity in the rise of moralizing religions. Using a broad range of new measures of belief in moralizing supernatural punishment, we find strong support for previous research showing that such beliefs did not drive the rise of social complexity in world history. By contrast, our analyses indicate that intergroup warfare, supported by resource availability, played the most significant role in the evolution of both social complexity and moralizing religions. Thus, the correlation between social complexity and moralizing religion would seem to result from shared evolutionary drivers, rather than from strong direct causal relationships between these two variables.

While the influence of electoral systems on accountability and representation has been widely studied, the link between electoral systems and corruption remains sparse. This paper develops a model for the interplay between corruption and electoral rules, considering the incentives for challengers to expose the corruption undertaken by the incumbents. I identify two major components: first, rules that increase competition create incentives for freeriding, as challengers would prefer that other challengers pay the cost of exposure. Second, larger district sizes create coordination problems, as the same incumbent may be overexposed, while others were not exposed at all. These characteristics make a mix of high competitiveness and PR the worst system regarding incentives for corruption. I show that these predictions hold empirically using quasi-experimental data from Brazilian municipalities. This study has implications for the design of electoral institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Competition|Corruption|Electoral systems|Incentives|Parties|Representation,2019-11-18T03:39:42.560750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-18T03:39:11.779349,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/citation/,srcg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd20ca49a42520012175d59/,5dd20ca49a42520012175d59,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srcg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/srcg2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/srcg2

In this paper, we study how investment capacity, defined as the resources remaining after the municipality perform the mandatory expenditures, influences elections in Brazil. We theorize that when a politician wins the election, this generates commitment problems in low investment capacity municipalities, as new mayors are unable to reward the firms that contributed to their campaigns. We test these claims by considering a close-elections regression discontinuity design coupled with heterogeneous quantile effects for Brazilian municipalities between 2000 and 2012. We find that incumbent mayors in towns with low investment capacity receive less campaign donation afterward and are more disadvantaged in their reelection contests. The results are robust to design variations and changes in party labels or mayoral characteristics. Our findings have implications for the influence of money on politics in democratic countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazil|Campaign Contributions|Close-elections Regression Discontinuity Design|Incumbency Effect|Investment Capacity,2019-11-18T03:38:05.489323,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-18T03:37:51.376725,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/citation/,hcnzu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd20aa45b97bd000b58ed9c/,5dd20aa45b97bd000b58ed9c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcnzu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hcnzu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hcnzu
