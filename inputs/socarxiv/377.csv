this massage reach to the ends of the earth for the evangelization of all, both the Jews and Gentiles,
he selected twelve apostles out of the disciples that followed him. These twelve he molded and
made the ""light"" of the world and ""salt"" of the earth and urged them to let their light shine so that
people will see their light and glorify their father who is in heaven (Matt. 5:13-16). It is this
twelve that followed him from the inception of his ministry to the end of his ministry. The
implication is that they were with him from his baptism to his ascension. Having formed the
Twelve, he sent them on a mission to evangelize the whole world. The aim of this article is to
restate anew the inseparability of formation and mission in the work of evangelization and their
indispensability in the work of evangelization. This paper argues that if the mandate of Jesus in
Matt. 28:16-20 is duly understood and imbibed then formation, and re-formation of evangelizers
cannot be over emphasized. Significantly, the outcome of this research will be of immense benefit

one looks around today one discovers that Africa has become the dumping ground of used
products from Europe and America and to save life, one must travel to get adequate medical
attention. Hospitals, schools, road networks, modern mass communication equipments, job
opportunities, scholarship schemes, electricity are majorly in shambles or epileptic. When one
visits some institutions of higher learning as well as hospitals outside the shores of Africa, one
discovers that experts in various fields working in them are from Africa. One of the things
migration of the young from Africa to Europe and America has taught us is that African children
can compete favourably with their European and American counterparts when placed under the
same condition. Hence, it is not that Africans are not gifted intellectually, they are but African's
intellectual prowess has not been adequately harnessed as a result of the actions and inactions of
their leaders. This proves that there is nothing wrong with African soil, water, air and vegetation.
The problem is actually perpetuated daily by old, selfish, visionless and uncharismatic leaders in
Africa. When such leaders are on seat, the destinies of their citizens are daily suppressed
knowingly or unknowingly. This study aims at showing that African underdevelopment lies in the
hands of selfish and sit-tight leaders. Jesus in the above chapter and verses of Matthew urges that
anyone who will present himself to be a leader must be the servant of others. The desire of a
servant leader centers on how to help all citizens realize their destinies. This study adopted the
historical critical exegesis as well as library research as her methodology to arrive at her
conclusions. This study argues that if present crop of leaders in Africa were to be selfless and
charismatic, Africa will be the envy of the whole world. Significantly, this study will be of

Mostly, election is done so as to avert constitutional crisis. Such an election is always successful to the admiration and acceptability of all and sundry when the majority have sincere heart and intention and working selflessly towards communal wellbeing. Admiration and acceptability of any electoral outcome depend solely on the faithful observance of laid down criteria for the said election. Compromise of any electoral criteria (law) gives room for outright rejection of results which may eventually leads to anarchy if not properly managed by the court of the said land. Election of Matthias in Acts 1:12-26 shows oneness of purpose, and willingness to follow a laid down criteria for anyone who would replace the impaired disciple. The criteria suggested two qualified candidates. Eventually, Matthias was unanimously elected and admirably accepted. The aim of this paper is to show that the majority of the electoral outcome that are rejected and contested in court are those the criteria that led to them were highly compromised.

This shows how one of the biggest educational challenges for K – 12 STEM education is that few general guidelines or models exist for teachers to follow regarding how to teach using STEM integration approaches in their classroom. This also goes to show how the most common conception of STEM education might be the notion of integration – meaning that STEM is the purposeful integrations of the various disciplines as used in solving real – word problems. Despite the benefits of integrated curricula seem clear, there are barriers that must be negotiated when teachers choose to implement integrated STEM curricula. Therefore, the focus of this literature review will also be on quantitative studies that provide information on teachers continuously using a traditional instruction contradicting the definition of integrated STEM education.

These frameworks are based preferentially on conceptual approaches, which leads to biases when applied in practice. Here, we present a study with an alternate focus: the skills proposed in the frameworks are connected with user behavior and heuristics are employed to group these skills. The objectives of the study were to: (1) achieve a greater coherence between the skills incorporated in these frameworks and user behavior, and (2) identify and reliably organize the clusters of skills that form frameworks. The study consisted of collecting data from a group of students about their practices within the skills of the Mozilla Web Literacy Map. The data was then grouped via factor analysis. The results were then contrasted with the initial organization of the Mozilla framework.

The implementation of inquiry-based science instruction in school curricula requires not only a shift in teachers’ theoretical perspectives on science and science education, but also a change in school policy. Studies examining the impact of teachers’ theoretical lenses on their teaching practices reveal that teachers who recognize the interplay of science education and society, and the idea that students build knowledge based on preexisting knowledge over time, will be more likely to see the importance of, and attempt to implement, inquiry-based instruction in their classrooms. Additionally, an analysis of policy documents reveals that: organizational change is difficult especially because those creating and implementing the policy do not fully understand or even realize the impact on teachers and students. Teachers should be fully involved in this process. Inquiry-based instruction has the potential to significantly improve the experience of science education for students and should be seriously considered by educators and policy makers.",TRUE,FALSE,inquiry-based instruction|nature of science|teacher change,2019-04-28T03:36:28.089006,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-28T03:35:55.587022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction,Isabella Boutros,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/citation/,a6nsk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc514e142c4b70018b33c49/,5cc514e142c4b70018b33c49,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6nsk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6nsk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6nsk,NA

The importance of teaching financial literacy in schools is now highly recognized (Lusardi &amp; Mitchell, 2014). Not only is financial literacy education implemented in many curricula around the world, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has administered a financial literacy assessment in 2012 and 2015 via their triennial Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). This sent an important message around the world about the importance of financial literacy in schools. The field has not had all its parameters defined and there is a need to identify what is meant by “financial literacy” and what are the goals of this new emerging field. Thus, this review seeks to synthesize and summarize common themes and trends among financial literacy literature to shed light on the goals and definitions of financial literacy. An exploration of how this field is defined within mathematics and the goals for teaching this within the discipline of mathematics will explored. Further, this review will explore how financial literacy tasks are used in the mathematics classroom and how researchers design and implement these tasks",TRUE,FALSE,critical mathematics|Financial education|Financial Literacy,2019-04-28T03:33:00.869621,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-28T03:32:44.676383,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,Philippe Turineck,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/citation/,nwzvp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc4ece1d7dc3f00166a7e10/,5cc4ece1d7dc3f00166a7e10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwzvp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nwzvp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nwzvp,NA
