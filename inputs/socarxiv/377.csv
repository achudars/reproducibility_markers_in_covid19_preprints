These essays were written by 56 Swedish university students studying English as a second language at three different educational levels. The results reveal that while there were clear links between mid-essay corrections/comments and grades given, the links between mid-essay corrections/comments and end comments were not only comparatively few, but less clear. Moreover, although valued highly in the research literature because of their ability to promote writing skills in an enhanced manner, there were more summative end comments than formative ones. The conclusion was, therefore, drawn that it is quite taxing for assessors, even for experienced ones, to produce connections that involve an alignment among a) mid-essay corrections/comments, b) end comments and c) grade that will, at the same time, promote students’ writing skills in accordance with what is suggested by the research literature. The assessors were, however, irrespective of grade given, attuned to the educational level at hand, focusing more on analytic aspects at the two lower levels, while taking a more holistic approach at the highest educational level. This may indicate that offering corrections/comments does not only entail a developmental journey for students, but for teachers too.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-11T16:39:23.005024,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:38:28.980344,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/citation/,q972c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da003aaf6b03e000d1ccbd4/,5da003aaf6b03e000d1ccbd4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q972c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q972c/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q972c

The current so-called ‘universal’ social protection systems guarantee social citizen rights, while the revisited truly universalism guarantees social human rights for everyone. Crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA) is used to map and track the level of exclusiveness or inclusiveness into social pensions in the existing 30 social pension programmes on 28 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. The article examines the various paths of eligibility requirements in social pensions conditioning three specific outcomes: (1) access for every older-age individual (truly universal), (2) access for every category of immigrant (no targeting by citizenship or residency) and (3) access for older-age immigrants with legal resident status (targeting by residency but not by citizenship). The research makes several contributions. First, it offers a useful inventory of the eligibility requirements for access to the 30 social pensions in LAC. Second, it proposes an analytical framework to redefine universalism after considering the migration-social policy nexus. Contrary to what the literature claims, there are no universal social pensions in the region. Third, the analysis indicates that only in two countries, Cuba and Jamaica, social pensions have immigrant-friendly targeting rules, requiring neither citizenship nor any length of residency to become a beneficiary. A total of 12 countries require citizenship and 24 of them a certain number of years of residency. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of social pensions are means-tested. Finally, the csQCA allows identifying patterns of targeting mechanisms and is used to propose five exploratory regimes of inclusionary social pensions. The article calls for protected international mobility of the older-age population in the form of a truly universalistic system in which the entire aged population has the right to a social pension. Only then, countries would truly adhere to Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",TRUE,FALSE,caribbean|latin america|migration|Migration|non-contributory pensions|older-age|pensions|QCA|qualitative comparative analysis|social policy|social protection|targeting|universalism|welfare,2019-10-10T18:48:41.531385,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10T18:32:49.377926,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/citation/,w7zrq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u687n/,u687n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9f65a5f6b03e00101c7616/,5d9f65a5f6b03e00101c7616,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w7zrq/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1468018119873267,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w7zrq

A vital one was the presence of a need, initially that of how to get water out of mines and later how to drive the new machinery that was being produced as part of the industrial revolution. But needs are common and they are not always met. The reasons why those needs were met was due to the scientific progress that was going on in 16th and 17th century Europe concerning the knowledge of atmospheric pressure, how to create vacuums and of the properties of gases. Allied to this scientific progress was a belief in Europe at the time that progress could be made and problems could be solved. The inventors at the time applied scientific knowledge to solving the problems that existed and after long periods of trial and error, including the development of new and better materials, were able to produce a working steam engine.

However, there is no empirical consensus on demographic and socioeconomic factors driving migration decision. Exploiting micro census data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series International (IPUMSI) database across 65 countries over the period 1960 to 2012 covering 477,296,432 individual records, this study aims to establish common demographic drivers of migration. Given an exceptionally large number of observations, a parametric approach would simply yield bias estimates of standard errors of the variables of interest.

The decision trees are applied to each country year sample individually in order to control for local optima. Resulting feature selections are compared across countries and years. We find that globally, age, education, household size, and urbanisation are important drivers of internal migration. Age and education are particularly important predictors in Europe and Northern America whilst in South and Central America and Africa, urbanisation and household size are more relevant. The applied method of localised decision trees could be a helpful tool for analysing large-scale census data in other social science domains.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|classification trees|migration,2019-10-10T18:47:21.101624,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10T18:27:29.056933,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/citation/,bz6yu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9e2e35fcf91f00111b54c3/,5d9e2e35fcf91f00111b54c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bz6yu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bz6yu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bz6yu

Evidence from a Global Field Experiment,"Entrepreneurial motivation is important to the process of economic growth.  However, evidence on the motivations of innovative entrepreneurs, and how those motivations differ across fundamental characteristics, remains scant.  We conduct three interrelated field experiments with the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge to study how innovative entrepreneurs respond to messages of money and social impact, and how this varies across gender and culture. We find consistent evidence that women and individuals located in more altruistic cultures are more motivated by social impact messages than money, while men and those in less altruistic cultures are more motivated by money than social impact. The estimates are not driven by differences in the type of company, its size, or other observable characteristics, but instead appear to come from differences in the underlying motivations of innovative entrepreneurs themselves.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|entrepreneurship|innovation|motivations|women,2019-10-10T18:47:03.021009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10T18:26:18.740769,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/citation/,t7crk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9df613fcf91f00111b18a0/,5d9df613fcf91f00111b18a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7crk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t7crk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t7crk

Indirect reciprocity explains how social norms and moral reputations can collectively support cooperation: members of the society cooperate who others who are considered good. But the theory of indirect reciprocity requires institutions that monitor and publicly broadcast moral reputations. Here we study evolution of adherence to public monitoring in societies where individuals are, at first, independently responsible for evaluating the moral reputations of their peers. We show that adherence to a public institution of moral assessment can evolve and promote cooperation under all simple social norms, depending upon the institution's tolerance to occasional antisocial behavior. We specify how an institution's size and its degree of tolerance towards antisocial behavior can be designed to dramatically increase cooperation rates, even for social norms that previous studies have found to perform poorly. Public monitoring serves to eliminate disagreements about reputations in the population, which in turn increases cooperation and individual payoffs, so that adherence to the public institution can evolve by social contagion. Adherence is then robust to invasion, and it tends to crowd out internal mechanisms that could alternatively support cooperation. These results help explain why societies tend to elect centralized institutions to provide top-down moral governance of their individual behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-10T18:46:41.579383,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10T18:25:04.459410,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/citation/,7e4ht,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9df1b9fcf91f00111b1322/,5d9df1b9fcf91f00111b1322,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7e4ht/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7e4ht
