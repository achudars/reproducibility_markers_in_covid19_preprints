prosecutor of the Federal Republic of Germany in April 1977 was 
phenomenologically a successful frontal strike against the West German 
state. Even today, members of the Red Army Faction claim credit for this 
assassination as a success of the resistance against the Federal 
Republic, which with military precision and at equal level had plunged 
the state power into a national crisis. Buback played a noticeable role 
in the East-West conflict of the 60s and 70s as a federal prosecutor. 
With the departure of the era of détente, he was appointed attorney 
general and became the protagonist of the fight against terrorism. The 
so-called ""Kissinger Cables"", classified diplomatic correspondence of 
the US State Department from the years 1973-1976, provide a glimpse on 
what turmoil the Federal Attorney General created for the Allies and the 
German government until shortly before his assassination. The purpose of 
this manuscript is to analyze Buback’s action during the East-West 
conflict of the 60s and 70s and to come to a view of the same from the 
diplomatic point of view of the Allies and the Federal Government.*",TRUE,FALSE,NA,assasination|counter terrorism|Germany|Kissinger Cables|Preprint|red army faction|socarxiv|terrorism,2018-07-02T10:48:29.563475,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T22:51:18.094000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/citation/,cpysg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezejh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/relationships/node/,ezejh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578968e8594d9001f6859ed2/,578968e8594d9001f6859ed2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpysg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cpysg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cpysg

Copyright is not based on written claims, but because copyright links exclusive rights to technological actions such as reproduction, distribution, or transmission, the language of the copyright statute, and judicial readings of the statute, create boundaries around which potential infringers may technologically navigate. For example, the Aereo case recently decided by the Supreme Court involves technology that was explicitly designed to conform to non-infringing definitions of private transmission found in previous court decisions.

While an obituary for the incentive theory of patenting is likely premature, the concept that the patent system is based upon myth should not be surprising. Over the past 30 years, some of the most prominent work in sociology has focused on social ordering, including legal ordering, that is found to be structured around prevalent social narratives or myths. Explicitly rejecting the economic construct of rational behavior, such ""new institutional"" approaches to social ordering recognize that organizations adopt practices and structures according to widely recognized scripts or conventions that lend legitimacy to their goals. In this essay I suggest that the known behavior of patenting firms likely fits the models developed in new institutional sociology: firms patent because other firms patent, because investors expect them to patent, and because patents validate the firm as innovative and reputable. Following such conventions is socially rational, but not necessarily economically rational. Applying new institutional approaches to patenting could explain several pervasive yet puzzling behaviors within the patent system, and moves us away from interminable fruitless arguments over the idealized efficiency or inefficiency of patents.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:49.790658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T22:02:18.955000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/citation/,q8k6n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vv6qa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/relationships/node/,vv6qa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57895d6cb83f6901f3c0634e/,57895d6cb83f6901f3c0634e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q8k6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q8k6n

The statutory requirements for invention incorporate purportedly objective criteria against which new technologies are measured for patent eligibility. For example, inventions are assessed from the perspective of the fictional “person having ordinary skill in the art” (PHOSITA) for compliance with the statutory requirements of obviousness, enablement, and written description.

Feminist scholarship has previously questioned representations of objectivity, as purportedly neutral criteria may be oriented toward a rational, masculine default that is in fact anything but neutral. Previous scholarship has disclosed such bias in fields including both the legal and scientific standards that intersect in the patent statute. These analytical tools may yield similar insights when applied to patents.
