Online practices of grassroots participation, which used to be considered the prerogative of democratizing forces fighting established powers, turned out to be an effective platform for far-right extremists. In the attempt to make sense of what happened and develop workable solutions, stakeholders rapidly moved through the different stages of grief, ranging from denial to anger and acceptance.

As a case in point, we trace the path through these stages which moved from an initial denial of the problem to concern over “fake news” and hoaxes, to finally focusing on the behavior of certain actors on the platform. Starting from the current phase, we analyze “coordinated inauthentic behavior”, a concept only briefly defined in Facebook public statements which, nevertheless, is useful to frame future studies insofar as both the idea of coordination and authenticity have been studied in the literature. Leveraging these works, we suggest a definition that is at once framed in this literature and easy to operationalize.

Using this definition and an unprecedented combination of CrowdTangle API (a tool for accessing Facebook and other social media data) and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election, we developed a method that led to the identification of several networks of pages/groups/verified public profiles (“entities”) that shared the same political news stories on Facebook within a very short period of time (10 in 2018, composed of 28 entities, and 50 in 2019, composed of 143 entities). We call this behavior “coordinated link sharing”. By analyzing the social media profiles of such coordinated entities, we observed that while some of them were clearly political, others presented themselves as entertainment venues, despite sharing political content too. Since the political news stories shared by these non-political entities can reach a broad audience which is largely unguarded against attempts to influence, we describe their behavior as “inauthentic”.

Further analyses showed that the news shared by the coordinated networks received a Facebook engagement higher than other news included in our dataset, that much news boosted anti-immigration and far-right propaganda and that several of the news outlets shared by these networks were already blacklisted by fact-checkers.",TRUE,FALSE,coordinated inauthentic behaviour|crowdtangle|election|facebook|italy|link sharing|social media,2019-09-20T20:42:43.439056,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20T20:41:41.424674,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/citation/,3jteh,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wy7rd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/relationships/node/,wy7rd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d84d8ac305a6800190b5b65/,5d84d8ac305a6800190b5b65,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3jteh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3jteh

I ask two questions: 1) how do people who live in regions of consistent economic decline interpret the meanings of absent transportation? And thus, 2) what does transportation maintenance look like in those regions? This line of inquiry emerged unexpectedly from a broader interview project. Between 2015 and 2017, I conducted 90 interviews in two communities at opposite ends of a former, Midwestern steel commodity chain. In both a rural, iron mining community and an urban steel manufacturing neighborhood, transportation infrastructure emerged unbidden and central in interviewees’ descriptions of boom and bust. The late 19th and early 20th century construction of industrial transportation—rail, shipping, and roadways—was recalled by interviewees as facilitating both economic growth and cultural connection required for the social thriving of these communities. The closure of the anchor companies in these communities, then, was the climax in interviewees’ narratives, and the decline (both intentional and natural) of industrial transportation infrastructure appeared again and again as a visible, experienced, and emotional metaphor of the gradual disconnection and loss they experienced. References to declines in industrial transportation often segued to frustrations about the uneven distribution of public transportation (bus and passenger train) or highways. Declines in industrial employment and infrastructures propelled massive depopulation in my case study regions; depopulation, in turn, caused disinvestment in public transportation. This paper expands on the transportation track themes of marginalization of certain segments of the population, with a particular focus on the lived experiences of deindustrialization.",TRUE,FALSE,embodiment|infrastructure|metaphor|rust belt|transportation,2019-09-20T20:38:21.922019,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20T20:38:10.912565,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/citation/,3mhca,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d84cc8f305a6800170ba768/,5d84cc8f305a6800170ba768,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3mhca/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3mhca

This study describes the development and validation the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS-36) which measures the extent to which females’ menstrual practices and environments meet their needs. 
Methods. A 54-item pool was developed following systematic-review of qualitative and quantitative studies and expert feedback. Item reduction and scale validation were undertaken using a cross-sectional survey of 538 menstruating schoolgirls in Soroti, Uganda. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a sub-sample of 52 girls two weeks after the first administration. Construct validity was tested through relationships with hypothesised correlates: confidence to manage menses, self-reported school absenteeism, and mental health symptoms. 
Results. The final MPNS-36 comprises 28 items applicable to all respondents, and 8 items capturing washing and drying experiences for those reusing menstrual materials. A four-factor solution for the core 28 items was the best fit for the data (RMSEA=0.028-0.029; CFI=0.961-0.964; TFI=0.957-0.959), supplemented by two factors for reuse (RMSEA=0.021-0.030; CFI=0.987-0.994; TFI=0.981-0.991). Subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores to support accessibility for practitioners. Subscales were ‘material and home environment needs’ (11 items, α-ordinal=0.84), ‘transport and school environment needs’ (5-items, α-ordinal=0.73), ‘material reliability concerns’ (3-items, α-ordinal=0.55), ‘change and disposal insecurity’ (9-items, α-ordinal=0.80), ‘reuse needs’ (5-items, α-ordinal=0.76), and ‘reuse insecurity’ (3-items, α-ordinal=0.56). Relationships between subscales and hypothesised correlates supported validity. Home- and school-based items were more strongly associated with confidence to manage menstruation at home and school, respectively. Higher scores predicted not missing school during the last menstrual period (total score: OR=2.62, 95%CI=1.52-4.50). Test-retest reliability was moderate (total score: ICC(2,1)=0.69).
Conclusions. The MPNS-36 demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity. It is the first measure to capture women and girls perceived menstrual hygiene and may be used across a range of study designs to assess menstrual needs.

On the basis of a representative sample of the German population, which includes 1403 respondents who were interviewed at three waves separated by 6 months, we investigate the privacy paradox from a longitudinal perspective. Using a cross-lagged panel model with random intercepts, we differentiate between-person relations from within-person effects. Results revealed that people who were more concerned about their online privacy than others also shared slightly less personal information and had substantially more negative attitudes toward information sharing (between-person level). People who were more concerned than usual also shared slightly less information than usual (within-person level). We found no long-term effects of privacy concerns on information sharing or attitudes 6 months later.

In contrast to previous studies, the model relies on the probability distribution of a default time/jump rather than the default time itself, as the default time is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can achieve a high order of accuracy with a relatively easy implementation. We find that the valuation of a defaultable derivative is normally determined via backward induction when their payoffs could be positive or negative. Moreover, the model can naturally capture wrong or right way risk. https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3yjk2/download",TRUE,FALSE,collateralization|credit risk modeling|credit value adjustment (CVA)|default probability approach (DPA)|default time approach (DTA)|least square Monte Carlo|margin|netting|right way risk|wrong way risk,2019-09-19T11:58:21.866606,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-19T11:58:11.363518,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/citation/,3yjk2,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d82b442b3103d00194e8f8f/,5d82b442b3103d00194e8f8f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yjk2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3yjk2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3yjk2

In light of the public resurgence of white nationalist sentiment coinciding with the Trump presidency, the current study shifts the focus from attitudes toward a target minority as the outcome to Christian nationalism’s association with whites’ attitudes toward “racists” themselves. We use data from the 1996 and 2014 General Social Surveys and consider relative political tolerance toward old-fashioned racists (i.e., persons who believe black Americans are genetically inferior) compared to other historically stigmatized groups, including anti-religionists, communists, militarists, and homosexuals. Viewing Christian identity as essential to American civic belonging is among the strongest predictors of whites’ being politically intolerant of all stigmatized groups, racists included. However, when we examine relative tolerance toward racists compared to other stigmatized groups, white Christian nationalists show greater tolerance than other whites. This effect is distinct from personal religiosity which is associated with lower relative tolerance toward racists. Additionally, we find both survey year and gender moderate the association between white Christian nationalism and relative tolerance toward racists. Findings ultimately demonstrate that white Americans who adhere to Christian nationalism exhibit authoritarian tendencies―expressing lower tolerance for all groups considered―while making greater relative allowance for old-fashioned racists, who may be allies in the task of social control and coercion.",TRUE,FALSE,blacks|political tolerance|racism|racists|religion|Trump|White Christian nationalism|whites,2019-09-19T11:57:23.437077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-19T11:57:08.392110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/citation/,kw73j,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d824bcb0d263000190bd216/,5d824bcb0d263000190bd216,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw73j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw73j

This is both theoretically and normatively appealing, suggesting that European party politics operates in a way that is consistent with spatial models. Nonetheless, virtually all previous studies are based on a single, uni-dimensional measure of public opinion: left-right self-placement from the Eurobarometer surveys. This measure has a number of flaws, including the fact that political conflict in Europe now occurs across multiple issue dimensions beyond the classic divide on state involvement in the economy. We use new measures of Europeans' ideological positions across four different issue dimensions and twenty-six countries from 1981-2016, together with data on parties' policy positions from their manifestos, to re-evaluate findings on responsiveness. Across many different model specifications, samples and outcome measures, we find virtually no evidence that European political parties respond to public opinion on any issue dimension. Our findings suggest that scholars may require better measures of party positions, more nuanced theories of responsiveness (for example to sub-groups, or across longer time horizons), or may need to re-focus their attention towards responsiveness via policy outcomes rather than parties' policy commitments.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-18T13:32:48.918623,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-18T13:32:27.690786,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/citation/,4bv5u,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8207d9b658b700185f9fdc/,5d8207d9b658b700185f9fdc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bv5u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4bv5u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4bv5u
