Nonetheless, the development of case law concerning copyright has implicitly centered on human creativity and originality, two qualities that a work must embody to be eligible for protection.' Moreover, copyright law has adapted over time, as technological innovations have confronted legislators and courts with new challenges in conception and application. Harmonizing the human role in copyright and technological innovations is therefore of the utmost importance if the United States' constitutional principle of furthering science is to be maintained. The difference between human creativity and computational
creativity is the first and most crucial question that needs to be answered. This is because many Al processes are currently being employed to mimic human capacities. The state of the art in Al should be clarified to demonstrate the role that humans play in creative machines and the creative output of machines. Whether, as a matter of empirical fact, Al-systems are capable of all the creative capacities that humans possess is directly related to the following question: who is the author of Al-generated works? In other words, to whom are economic rights in authorship to be transferred to and who has standing before a court in the case of infringement issues and the like?    This note is divided into five sections. The first section provides a brief definition, preliminary history, and summary of the latest developments of Al technology. This is followed by an in-depth investigation into the copyrightability of Al-generated works in the second section. Importantly, the second section will trace the locus of difference between human creativity and computational creativity and propose policy changes in the application of the notion of the originality which serves as a requisite for the allocation of authorship for copyright purposes. The third section will explore reasons to accept Al-generated works as copyrightable based on utilitarian grounds. Having thus established the grounds of copyright protection eligibility for Algenerated works, the fourth section will determine how authorship of these works is best attributed or recognized through a comprehensive analysis of the merits of seven plausible options: (i) the Al system itself as author; (ii) the programmer as author; (iii) the trainer as author; (iv) the user as author; (v) joint authorship; (vi) public domain or; (vii) the data proprietor. The final section proposes a solution to who should be accepted as the author of Al-generated works that better serves constitutional purposes and balances the many interests that are likely to arise between the various actors who develop creative machines or who lawfully obtain such machines.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-28T17:39:41.232708,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-28T17:39:14.279460,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/citation/,gnyha,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d9b65df83de200dcb004d3/,60d9b65df83de200dcb004d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gnyha/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gnyha/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gnyha,NA

This study tests the utility of elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) for discriminating between different knapping techniques and offers a new perspective on blade variability. Our results indicate that there is an overlap in the outline shape and symmetry of individual blades produced by direct percussion, indirect percussion, and pressure debitage. Nevertheless, the EFA points out certain group-level differences regarding the shape and regularity of blade outlines and yields classification accuracy which is comparable to the previously proposed quantitative approaches for distinguishing blades produced by different knapping techniques. However, a more detailed analysis of technique-related factors shows that the emerging variability of blade outlines is more complex and that tripartite division might not always be suitable for reconstructing the past knapping behavior. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this method, and how it could complement the standard technological analysis in exploring and explaining blade variability.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|elliptic Fourier analysis|geometric morphometrics|knapping technique|outlines|prismatic blades|regularity|shape,2021-06-28T17:39:21.239641,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-28T17:38:27.127094,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HGESZ,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/citation/,cxdsm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hgesz/,hgesz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d9a41831881a00cc640254/,60d9a41831881a00cc640254,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxdsm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cxdsm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cxdsm,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.103079

A perspective to spark new research.,"In this perspective article we start from the theories of constructivism and conceptual change within the field of education to develop and present hypotheses about how understandings of biodiversity and diversity more generally are formed. We argue that extrinsic and circumstantial elements from everyday experiences are relevant in shaping understandings of biodiversity.
We discuss how children’s games and food-related experiences may influence how children form conceptions of biodiversity. We focus on ‘misconceptions,’ areas where conceptions differ from established ideas in ecology. These include: underestimating the importance of diversity for “complementarity” and over-simplifications of how nature works. Firstly, we examine a type of children’s game that often concerns biodiversity and consists of a puzzle where the forming of categories is encouraged. Secondly, we discuss people’s relation to nature through food in their diets. 
We believe that targeted intervention is needed to move towards an inclusive and multi-faceted representation of biodiversity, one that emphasises fundamental properties that make a whole and interacting parts. We argue that experiences of games and food can be pivotal in developing a deeper understanding of these fundamental properties of biodiversity. These would be important experiences to consider when attempting transformative change of relationships between people and nature.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|biodiversity|education|experiences|pre-K,2021-06-28T17:39:03.670371,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-28T17:37:58.770158,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d51|Education|Outdoor Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d54|Education|Elementary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/citation/,bqvxp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d974b7f83de200b3b00180/,60d974b7f83de200b3b00180,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqvxp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bqvxp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bqvxp,NA

We analysed trends in employment rates among Finnish partnered and single mothers and fathers from 1987 to 2018. In the late 1980s’ Finland, single mothers’ employment was internationally high and on par with that of partnered mothers, and single fathers’ employment rate was just below that of partnered fathers. The gaps between single and partnered parents emerged and increased during the 1990s recession, and after the 2008 economic crisis, it widened further. In 2018, the employment rates of single parents were 11–12 percentage points lower than those of partnered parents. We ask how much of this single parent employment gap could be explained by compositional factors, and the widening educational gradient of single parenthood in particular. We use Chevan and Sutherland’s decomposition technique on register data, which allows us to decompose the single parent employment gap into the composition and rate effects by each category of the background variables. The findings point to an increasing double disadvantage of single parents: the gradually evolving disadvantage in educational backgrounds together with large differences in employment rates between single and partnered parents with low education explain the widening employment gap. Socio-demographic changes in interaction with changes in the labour market can produce inequalities by family structure in a Nordic society known for its extensive support for combining childcare and employment for all parents.",TRUE,FALSE,education|employment|Finland|inequality|single fathers|single mothers|single parents,2021-06-28T17:38:26.382313,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-28T17:37:30.952367,FALSE,NA,no,Licenses to use data are granted by Statistics Finland (www.stat.fi).,,no,No preregistration,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Juho Härkönen|Marika Jalovaara|Eevi Lappalainen|Anneli Miettinen,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/citation/,c935e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d963f0f83de200a8b092e7/,60d963f0f83de200a8b092e7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c935e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c935e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c935e,NA

At its core is a commitment to social criticism via the exposure and challenging of those rhetorics that provide cover for dominant interests. Our focus is on the field of health and health care, with particular reference to the largely hidden agendas of successive Health Ministers post-2010. We present two substantial case studies. The first concerns the sustained attack on the National Health Service (NHS) with a view to replacing it with a more market-oriented system. This begins with the run-up to the Health and Social Care Act of 2012 and goes on to feature governmental action taken as a consequence of this Act, often under the public radar. The second hones in on the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. We argue that this reflects an ideological commitment to undermine and marketise the NHS and its public health arm.

Blackboard platform in three Saudi public universities (Taibah, Hail, and Al-Baha) during COVID-19
pandemic. It examines the main learning activities which ensure the achievement of education quality
during unprecedented online learning. These activities are online learning preference, efficiency,
participation, achievements, success, and assigned assessment tasks. The survey-based questionnaire
method was used to elicit students’ responses regarding online learning effectiveness. The total number
of students who participated in the survey is 333 (entirely regular bachelor’s courses in different
majors). The main section of the questionnaire contains several questions about leading online learning
activities. The coefficient relation of the p-value is highly correlated when tested using Pearson’s r
and Spearman’s. The score of Cronbach’s Alpha is 0.93, which indicates (greater internal consistency)
an acceptable level of reliability. The overall mean is 0.20, and the standard deviation for the sample
is 0.095. The findings positively emphasize the significant influence of online learning on students’
academic achievements in most learning factors except in an assigned assessment factor, which is
still problematic in the online learning process.",TRUE,FALSE,|COVID-19 Pandemic|Learners’ Attitudes|Learning Effectiveness|Online Learning|Saudi Universities,2021-06-26T20:20:01.961604,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-26T20:19:44.898210,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/citation/,br9j5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d63e8bf83de20009afdcaa/,60d63e8bf83de20009afdcaa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/br9j5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/br9j5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/br9j5,https://doi.org/10.4018/IJICTE.20211001.oa7

Improving Research with the Logic of Machine Learning,"Social science research is interested in the growing number of Americans who express no religious affiliation on surveys, but concerns about underreporting, misreporting, and inconsistency in lived religion raises a question about our most common survey measure of nonreligious self-identification. What is the predictive validity of our current explanations for why people disaffiliate? I advance the current literature using a logistic regression model for no religious affiliation fit on eleven samples from the General Social Survey (1988-2014) to predict respondents’ affiliation in the 2016 and 2018 samples. Results show our explanations can yield a fairly accurate predictive model, but errors are important and informative. The model is more likely to misclassify religiously unaffiliated respondents as affiliated. Analysis using model estimates shows that selection effects into non-affiliation explain differences in political views on culture wars issues. These findings challenge the use of categorical measures for nonreligion alone, because they suggest that measures of “low religion,” rather than “no religion,” are more useful for researchers seeking to overcome survey measurement error in studying this group.",TRUE,FALSE,Nonreligion|Religious Identity|Survey Methods,2021-06-25T20:39:01.100130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-25T20:38:34.096210,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/citation/,t8h9g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8t2x9/,8t2x9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d632f05624a1002462a338/,60d632f05624a1002462a338,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8h9g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t8h9g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t8h9g,NA
