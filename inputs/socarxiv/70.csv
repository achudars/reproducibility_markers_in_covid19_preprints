This study examines the difficulties that Saudi female EFL learners face in writing in secondary high schools. The study also aims to identify 12th grade female EFL learners’ needs in improving their writing skills. The research findings might help curriculum designers and EFL teachers to make improvements to a curriculum that meet EFL learners’ needs. The participants were 216 female EFL learners studying in public schools in Jeddah. A questionnaire including closed items on a Likert scale and one open-ended question were used to collect data, which were then analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results illustrate that female EFL learners’ main difficulties in EFL writing are mechanics, use of proper vocabulary, and organization of texts. Additionally, female learners expressed their needs and suggestions for improving their writing skills which are related to the specific difficulties they face. Accordingly, the researchers suggest establishing a well-designed writing program which provides learners with sufficient training in writing skills by increasing the number of hours given to writing.",TRUE,FALSE,curriculum design|difficulties|high school|needs analysis|Saudi female EFL learners|writing skills,2021-03-08T14:01:51.595951,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:01:28.931768,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/citation/,2qv39,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604598cc6a10eb00ae29de0f/,604598cc6a10eb00ae29de0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qv39/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2qv39/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2qv39

The phonetic similarity of two languages helps EFL learners to grasp the lexical accent with the accurate articulation of the words from the second language. However, the difference in sound patterns in various languages prompts the learners to mispronounce the words more frequently. This critical study endeavors to evaluate the influential aspects of the mother tongue on the EFL learners’ second language (L2) discourse. This research is carried out through a qualitative method for critical discourse analysis to answer the main question; what significant errors students make that reflect their mother tongue influence? For a comparative study, the participants are the Saudi undergraduates from multidimensional sections of female colleges in King Khalid University and the non-native English-speaking teachers from five different nations, who also manifest the influence of their mother tongue on English language speaking. Their recorded presentations and conversations were analyzed to identify the interference of their mother tongue on their English language performance. The language patterns of both students and the teachers eventually affect their English language efficiency. The significant outcome of this study reveals the possibility of the pros and cons of the mother tongue on L2 learning.

The modern, digital definition of memes depicts them simply as pictures with texts circulated in social media platforms that tackle a particular issue in a humorous way (Chen, 2012; Rogers, 2014; Shifman, 2014). Due to its growing popularity, memes have been considered as a tool to negotiate cultural-social norms especially among teenagers (Gal, Shifman &amp; Kampf, 2016). However, not much research has been done on memes in relation to other fields. Therefore, it is important to examine how the educational field could benefit from utilizing memes in discourse analysis and English teaching. To be more specific, the study aims at investigating the perceptions of Omani students at Middle East College of the utilizations of memes in the education. The present study seeks to answer the question: how do Omani undergraduate students perceive the use of memes inside the classroom? Primarily, data was collected through observing 29 semester three students in a higher education institute by giving them five different memes to infer their pragmatic meaning. After the observation, a short questionnaire was distributed to students to investigate their perception of memes. The findings revealed that most students were able to infer the pragmatic meanings embedded in memes. In addition, students held positive attitudes towards the use of memes in their study. The paper concluded with some practical implications on the best methods to utilize memes in education, and suggestions for future research.

To achieve this aim, this paper first defines and illustrates the concept of globalization and then draws upon the World Systems Theory and Dependency Theory to contextualize Oman in terms of its global position. Through the lens of these theories, the paper explores the consequences of implementing English as a medium of instruction (EMI) policy at CsoT. The findings reveal that English language is still considered a foreign language, yet EMI is implemented at higher education. Moreover, despite the challenges faced by students, some exhibited a positive attitude towards the implementation of the EMI policy. For instance, many students perceived learning and using English as a means of endowing them with high international status, referencing its utility in relation to global communication, development, and employment. Such an impact is arguably linked to semi-colonialization. A link is then made to the concept of memorization, which is historically associated with the Islamic culture of Oman. The paper explains how the memorization strategy could be misunderstood. The paper contends that memorization is the first step in learning and understanding, not a substitute. A link is also made to the EMI policy, in which the low levels of achievement among students at these colleges have driven them to memorize and does not reflect a lack of critical thinking skills.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-08T14:49:01.062165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:48:49.098658,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/citation/,mnupe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6045961b6a10eb00b929e8f1/,6045961b6a10eb00b929e8f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnupe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mnupe/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mnupe

Like no other time before, this pandemic has posed a serious test of resilience of HEIs – hence, the current study sets off to seize this opportunity to study the resilience of Omani HEIs. HEIs in Oman have devised contingency plans in light of the directives and declarations received from the government Supreme Committee responsible for handling the impact of COVID-19. The study aimed at examining the directives received by Omani HEIs against the framework of the securitization theory in order to identify the substances of the basis on which HEIs built their teaching and learning plans. The study was also planned to closely investigate the individual experiences of various stakeholders directly involved in the implementation of the contingency of the teaching and learning plans. Data were collected using document analysis and analysis of reflective texts. Discourse content analysis was applied in order to understand the lived experiences of stakeholders and to identify what shaped their experiences. The discourse of the collected data was analysed using the approach of thematic analysis which helped to identify recurrent patterns concerning the teaching and learning plans of some Omani HEIs during COVID-19.  A number of challenges along with the challenges of other HEIs worldwide were identified, such as uncertainty and lack of resources and experience in online teaching and learning. The discussion of the findings in this study revealed dichotomies, as well as agreement, in the way stakeholders perceive aspects of the contingency plans of teaching, learning and assessment. On the basis of this finding, the study calls for a more nuanced approach to strengthen the resilience of higher education. Particularly, the study recommends incorporating processes of normalization of teaching and learning as well as of assessment in HEIs delivery modes as a way to consolidate HEIs’ resilience.",TRUE,FALSE,educational resilience|face-to-face education|face-to-face securitization theory|normalization|online teaching and learning,2021-03-08T13:57:41.092641,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T13:57:27.226189,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/citation/,dr3ws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6045952751a4a600ce7724dd/,6045952751a4a600ce7724dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dr3ws/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.20,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dr3ws

Such education could arm teachers with sufficient media literacy competence to pass on to students’ capabilities in democratic self-expression and social progress. The research gap that exists, therefore, leads to this qualitative research study where the aim is to explore how a group of five College EFL teachers in a Middle Eastern institution in Oman relate to critical media awareness. This is by deconstructing a US film entitled ‘Freedom Writers’ (2007) to discuss issues related to social injustice, prejudice, and violence in society. The method used to collect data was semi-structured interviews. The interview questions, guided by a semiotic Inquiry Graphics (IG) approach, aimed to capture those EFL teachers’ interpretations, values, and beliefs relevant to CML and their subsequent intentions to teach CML in their future English classrooms. The findings suggest that although the teachers demonstrated positive attitudes and increased awareness of CML, they lacked confidence in applying it and needed to expand their perceptions of CML further. Generally, they viewed CML as being helpful for students in its ability to develop their criticality and citizenship. However, the teachers stressed the harsh realities of a packed curriculum and restrictive program requirements that may obstruct any comprehensive implementation of CML education at a university level, an issue that merits further consideration.",TRUE,FALSE,Critical media literacy (CML)|EFL teachers|inquiry graphics (IG) approach|semiotics|social justice,2021-03-08T13:58:33.907149,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T13:57:59.375444,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/citation/,b36pk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6045947f51a4a600cd770a86/,6045947f51a4a600cd770a86,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b36pk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b36pk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b36pk

The physical presence of the student in the classroom has been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The only way in which the classes can continue is through online teaching programmes. This research tries to examine how effective is online teaching in a higher educational institution in Oman and worldwide. Here we will see the three dimensions of online education, namely (a) preparation, (b) execution, and (c) verification. Verification leads to negative and positive results.

Yet, it remains challenging for educators to engage students and make them participate. This qualitative research addresses the potential for exploiting gamification and interactive activities to achieve improved engagement in ELT classes. The integration of technology in education enables educators to use web-based games and interactive activities in ELT classes to get students’ engagement. An analysis of the research done in the related fields proves that games and interactive activities, integrated with technology, can be more effectively used in ELT classes to deliver better outcomes, which include enhanced motivation, active engagement, and willing participation of learners in the learning process. Another observation is that the current scenario has reinforced the need for using gamification and interactive activities in online classes. For instance, pedagogical applications like Forum (Moodle), Nearpod, Kahoot!, and H5P can be used in both regular face-to-face classes and in online classes. A careful analysis of some research findings proves that educators face a number of difficulties such as lack of training and insufficient time to prepare. However, the researchers in the field have also provided some possible solutions such as collaboration at different levels. The present scenario demands new approaches as online classes necessitate the implementation of modern techniques such as web-based gamification and interactive activities in order to actively engage students in ELT classes.",TRUE,FALSE,gamification|interactive activities|pedagogical application|students’ motivation|technology integration|web-based games,2021-03-08T13:59:27.841531,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T13:59:00.476817,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/citation/,x5me9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6045932f6a10eb00b929d966/,6045932f6a10eb00b929d966,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5me9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x5me9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x5me9

The language policies of successive governments resemble a kind of educational apartheid, where local languages have continuously been neglected. The paper reviews the various language policies in Pakistan, and then, critically examines the existing language policy, and its implications on medium of instruction. The analysis suggests that linguistic cohesion with multi-linguistic policies are needed to adopt a multi-lingual approach in language planning policy in Pakistan. A more pluralist approach to language planning and policy (the mother tongue and regional language for local/regional communication, Urdu for national use, and English for national and international communication) may present a range of implementation challenges. The study is significant because it will shade light on the linguistic situation in Pakistan, and on the government language policy. It will also try to figure out how Pakistan can develop an ecologically valid model for bi/multiliteracy for such complex linguistic context.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-08T14:47:26.268929,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:47:09.490233,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/citation/,b2yfq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604592966a10eb00b929d64a/,604592966a10eb00b929d64a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2yfq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b2yfq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b2yfq
