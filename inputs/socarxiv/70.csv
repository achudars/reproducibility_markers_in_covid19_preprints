Deviations in non-native English as a foreign language (EFL) teacher pronunciation remain a vibrant area of research due to their impact on speech intelligibility and comprehensibility, their pragmatic and emotional potential in oral verbal communication. The purpose of this contribution was to establish standard pronunciation deviations in academic speech of Ukrainian EFL teachers, thus depicting their phonetic portrait. A research methodology included acoustic and auditory analyses of pronunciation of British and Ukrainian speakers of English. The findings showed that Ukrainian EFL teachers display a set of common pronunciation distinctions: on the tonal level of the beginning and the end of the intonation group, tonal range, interval, rate and tone movement change in different parts of the intonation group, volume realization, speech rate; lack of qualitative and quantitative differences in the pronunciation of long and short monophthongs in stressed and unstressed syllables, full pronunciation of unstressed vowels.

Appraisal of Security Agents in Nigeria,"This paper sees the security of life as the essence of all security agents in the light of Acts 23:10. This is studied in the context of security agents in Nigeria. Life guarantees growth, success, productivity and development in all its ramifications. Security gives assurance that something highly valuable like life will not be taken away. Any idea that such will happen introduces uneasiness, fearfulness, retardation in development, self-doubt, lack of freedom and vulnerability of all will always be imagined. In the context of Acts 23:10, the government agent and the security agents are highly proactive which means taking the initiative to protect rather than acting afterlife has been extinguished, hence, Paul's life was secured. The spate of kidnappings, killings and maiming going on in Nigeria today have in so many instances introduce hopelessness and fearfulness in the minds of all and sundry. This is to the extent that some people no longer visit their rural villages. These reveal that security agents are not proactive but react to events. This work aims at showing that a security agent has no other business except to save life first and every other discussion will follow after that. To unpack the ideas in Acts 23:10, the author used hermeneutics and textual critical method of exegesis. The work recommends, among other things, that security agents should be made to understand the value of human life, hence a living person can answer any charge, unlike a dead one.

To achieve political legitimacy, support from the general public is important, as deservingness theory informs us that not all groups are equally perceived as deserving of assistance. Relying on a probability-based sample representative of the Dutch population (N = 1,601), participants were offered two choice-based conjoint experiments that measured what deservingness criteria matter most in respectively priority access to intensive care, and priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine. The results foremost show that noncompliance with government measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus impedes perceived deservingness. By contrast, being employed in the ‘crucial’ sector (i.e. health care and to a lesser extent education), leads to a higher perceived priority. Having an unhealthy BMI leads to less support for priority access to intensive care and vaccines. Age shows mixed patterns: public opinion would give less priority to elderly patients for intensive care. These results indicate that, control and reciprocity over need are important criteria to determine people’s deservingness of COVID-19 health care.

society. It provides the financially savvy better decision making, best investment alternatives and family wellbeing.
Unfortunately, most consumers especially in this part of our world appear relatively less active and less confident in
participating meaningfully in the financial sector due to lack of knowledge about the complex nature of financial
products and services and indeed the risk that goes with them. As a contribution in addressing this problem, this
study looked at financial literacy education and its implication on the economic and social life of the teacher in the
Upper East Region of Ghana. With a descriptive survey design, 118 participants responded to questionnaires. Results
showed low levels of financial literacy among participants which can negatively affect their daily financial
management. It is therefore definite that the financially literate has the advantage to undertake prudent alternative
investment decisions and able to make informed retirement planning. Being financially illiterate adversely affects
one’s life in relation to the culture of savings, expenditure pattern, investment decisions and budgeting skills, making
the individual economically insecure. The study has policy frontier implications; policy makers in the financial sector,
governments, non-governmental organisations and equity owners are encouraged to come to the aid of consumers,
especially teachers, by way of introducing professional teacher development programmes specifically tailored at
uplifting their financial literacy knowledge and skills",TRUE,FALSE,Decision|education|Financial|Knowledge|Literacy|Teacher,2020-11-28T18:43:01.719922,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-28T18:42:43.020412,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://irjms.com,available,NA,https://irjms.com,prereg_both,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/citation/,9be5s,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbd2125a7256300ae835a8a/,5fbd2125a7256300ae835a8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9be5s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9be5s/,https://doi.org/10.47857/irjms.2021.v02i01.046,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9be5s

By refusing to act as a lender of last resort, the European Central Bank pushed governments across the Eurozone to guarantee domestic financial liabilities. The importance of repurchase agreements to fund Eurozone banking and the predominance of European government bonds in general collateral left peripheral governments vulnerable to decreased private demand for their debt, and financially constrained by private intermediaries’ refusal of peripheral sovereign bonds in general collateral. This constraint created accelerated the sovereign debt crises driving the Eurozone crisis. This paper analyzes Eurozone banks’, National Central Banks’, and governments’ balance sheets to show how they have internalized the lessons from the GFC. We find that these entities have returned to holding larger concentrations of reserve assets, a practice that some architects of the Eurozone had hoped monetary integration at the supranational level would end. As Eurozone governments consider how to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, liquidity crunches that hurt financial and fiscal activity across the Eurozone remain a risk.",TRUE,FALSE,Endogenous Money|Eurozone Crisis|Monetary Policy|Post-Keynesian Economics,2020-11-24T06:45:42.535444,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-24T06:45:32.085608,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://stats.oecd.org/|https://data.imf.org/?sk=2DFB3380-3603-4D2C-90BE-A04D8BBCE237,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/citation/,qprm3,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y23gd/,y23gd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbc27aba72563003c832809/,5fbc27aba72563003c832809,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qprm3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qprm3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qprm3

Leveraging vital records from 26 major cities in the United States, we assess how variation in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), during the 1918 influenza pandemic influenced fertility. We find a strong reduction in fertility 9 months after pandemic peaks, with fertility dropping 20% in cities with short NPIs. Fertility a year later returns to pre-pandemic levels only in the cities with longer implementation of NPIs. The interplay between longer NPIs and reduced virus transmission appears to be the main mechanism increasing fertility 9 months after implementation.",TRUE,FALSE,Demography|fertility|Non-Pharmaceutical Interventiones|pandemics|Public health,2020-11-24T06:44:00.586510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-24T06:43:32.198636,FALSE,NA,no,Data was digitized by authors and is available upon request.,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/citation/,f3hv8,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbc1c9eab65180026b0fa13/,5fbc1c9eab65180026b0fa13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3hv8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f3hv8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f3hv8
