Rimmer, Matthew (Ed.) (2015) Indigenous Intellectual Property: A Handbook of Contemporary Research. Research Handbooks in Intellectual Property. Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, Mass.

This Handbook considers the international struggle to provide for proper and just protection of Indigenous intellectual property. Leading scholars consider legal and policy controversies over Indigenous knowledge in the fields of international law, copyright law, trademark law, patent law, trade secrets law, and cultural heritage. This collection examines national developments in Indigenous intellectual property from around the world. As well as examining the historical origins of conflicts over Indigenous knowledge, the volume examines new challenges to Indigenous intellectual property from emerging developments in information technology, biotechnology, and climate change.

Taking an interdisciplinary approach unmatched by any other book on this topic, this thoughtful Handbook considers the international struggle to provide for proper and just protection of Indigenous intellectual property (IP).

In light of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2007, expert contributors assess the legal and policy controversies over Indigenous knowledge in the fields of international law, copyright law, trademark law, patent law, trade secrets law, and cultural heritage. The overarching discussion examines national developments in Indigenous IP in the United States, Canada, South Africa, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia. The Handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the historical origins of conflict over Indigenous knowledge, and examines new challenges to Indigenous IP from emerging developments in information technology, biotechnology, and climate change.

Practitioners and scholars in the field of IP will learn a great deal from this Handbook about the issues and challenges that surround just protection of a variety of forms of IP for Indigenous communities.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement, which seeks to regulate copyright law, intermediary liability, and technological protection measures. The United States Government under President Barack Obama sought to export key features of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 (US) (DMCA). Drawing upon the work of Joseph Stiglitz, this paper expresses concerns that the TPP would entrench DMCA measures into the laws of a dozen Pacific Rim countries. This study examines four key jurisdictions—the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—participating in the TPP. This paper has three main parts. Part 2 focuses upon the takedown-and-notice scheme, safe harbours, and intermediary liability under the TPP. Elements of the safe harbours regime in the DMCA have been embedded into the international agreement. Part 3 examines technological protection measures—especially in light of a constitutional challenge to the DMCA. Part 4 looks briefly at electronic rights management. This paper concludes that the model of the DMCA is unsuitable for a template for copyright protection in the Pacific Rim in international trade agreements. It contends that our future copyright laws need to be responsive to new technological developments in the digital age—such as Big Data, cloud computing, search engines, and social media. There is also a need to resolve the complex interactions between intellectual property, electronic commerce, and investor-state dispute settlement in trade agreements.",TRUE,FALSE,Copyright Law|Digital Rights Management|electronic commerce|Electronic Rights Management Information|intellectual property|Intermediary Liability|international trade|investor-state dispute settlement|Safe Harbours|Takedown and Notice|Technological Protection Measures|Trans-Pacific Partnership,2018-07-02T11:06:46.883665,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-12T14:00:33.012361,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c29|Law|International Trade Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law,Matthew Rimmer,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/citation/,6vx3w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zdupv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/relationships/node/,zdupv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598f0871b83f690253e24f19/,598f0871b83f690253e24f19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vx3w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vx3w,NA

Summary statistics are helpful and important for evidence synthesis and decision making. However, they can be unstable and inconsistent due to diversity in research designs and variability in analytical specifications. They also mask the dynamics of individual responses to a certain intervention by focusing on average treatment effect on the treated, even though the variation in impact may be crucial information for policy makers. To establish stability and consistency of impact estimates and to reveal the dynamics of individual responses in RCTs, we conduct variable selection, harness the power of noise, implement Cumulative Quantile Analysis (CQA), and devise umbrella plots of loss and gain in this study, using real datasets from over 30 educational interventions funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) in England. For the purpose of comparison, which is essential in data visualisation, all the aforementioned methods are built upon multiple analytical approaches. We show that the importance of an intervention can be ordered through variable selection, and that the power of noise or the bias induced by inappropriate variables, can be utilised to assess the stability of an impact estimate. We also demonstrate that estimates of average treatment effect cannot fully capture the impact of an intervention on sub-groups of participants with varying levels of attainment at baseline, not to mention individual responses to the intervention. Using CQA and umbrella plots, we are able to supplement what common effect size estimates lack in educational interventions. We argue that the impact of an intervention is often more complex than the average treatment effect suggests, and that until a summary is more informative and able to speak directly to the eye, evidence-based policy and practice cannot be fully achieved.",TRUE,FALSE,Effect size|Evidence|Impact|Noise|RCT|Visualisation,2018-07-02T11:06:46.479884,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-11T17:47:28.113633,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/citation/,e4prv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96sr7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/relationships/node/,96sr7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598debf8594d900047a9fb15/,598debf8594d900047a9fb15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4prv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4prv,NA

Presence, Privacy, and Intimate Surveillance","The moment of birth was once the instant where parents and others first saw their child in the world, but with the advent of various imaging technologies, most notably the ultrasound, the first photos often precede birth (Lupton, 2013). In the past several decades, the question is no longer just when the first images are produced, but who should see them, via which, if any, communication platforms? Should sonograms (the ultrasound photos) be used to announce the impending arrival of a new person in the world? Moreover, while that question is ostensibly quite benign, it does usher in an era where parents and loved ones are, for the first years of life, the ones deciding what, if any, social media presence young people have before they’re in a position to start contributing to those decisions. This chapter addresses this comparatively new online terrain, postulating the provocative term intimate surveillance, which deliberately turns surveillance on its head, begging the question whether sharing affectionately, and with the best of intentions, can or should be understood as a form of surveillance. Firstly, this chapter will examine the idea of co-creating online identities, touching on some of the standard ways of thinking about identity online, and then starting to look at how these approaches do and do not explicitly address the creation of identity for others, especially parents creating online identities for their kids. I will then review some ideas about surveillance and counter-surveillance with a view to situating these creative parental acts in terms of the kids and others being created. Finally, this chapter will explore several examples of parental monitoring, capturing and sharing of data and media about their children, using various mobile apps, contextualising these activities not with a moral finger-waving, but by surfacing specific questions and literacies which parents may need to develop in order to use these tools mindfully, and ensure decisions made about their children’s’ online presences are purposeful decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|infancy online|infant wearables|intimate surveillance|social media|sonograms|surveillance|ultrasounds,2018-07-02T11:06:46.191297,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-11T06:34:10.462984,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/citation/,ay43e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fjh5e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/relationships/node/,fjh5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598d4f44b83f690253e1d9a1/,598d4f44b83f690253e1d9a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ay43e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ay43e,NA

However, little is known about the mechanisms that allowed for European upward advancement. This article begins to fill this gap by analyzing how naturalization policies influenced economic success of immigrants across generations. Specifically, I create new panel datasets that follow immigrants and their children across complete-count US censuses to understand the economic consequences of citizenship attainment. I find that naturalization raised occupational attainment for the first generation that then allowed children to have greater educational attainment and labor market success. I argue that economic progress was conditioned by political statuses for European-origin groups during the first half of the twentieth century.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:06:45.823497,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-10T20:01:47.506711,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Peter Catron,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/citation/,c7k45,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xg296/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/relationships/node/,xg296,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598cba91b83f69038deb747b/,598cba91b83f69038deb747b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7k45/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c7k45/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c7k45,NA

However, monetary matters only occupied a prominent position in the political agenda of England during times of crisis, when the kingdom faced a perceived threat of demonetization. The paper argues that, during the first two decades of the 17th century, concern with a positive balance of trade was only of secondary importance, being normally overshadowed by a more fundamental goal: a well-ordered, stable, and properly managed trade. This opened the door for debates about the limits of free initiative and regulation in economic affairs, as evidenced most clearly by the debates about free trade and monopolies that permeated James I’s reign.",TRUE,FALSE,17th Century|Edward Misselden|Free Trade|Mercantilism|Monopoly|Stuart England,2018-07-02T11:06:45.660942,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-10T17:00:05.754707,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,Journal of the History of Economic Thought,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/citation/,3yu8g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4j7nb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/relationships/node/,4j7nb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598c8f1c594d90023a1c7a21/,598c8f1c594d90023a1c7a21,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yu8g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3yu8g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3yu8g,NA

Upon analysis of data from 45 semi-structured interviews with second-year high school students from urban, rural, and Tibetan regions of China, this study finds that the consequences of mobile phone use are not always pre-determined. Teens do not merely use their phones to connect; they also treat them as ‘life’ and ‘thought’ companions, which they invest with feelings and thoughts that animate life experiences and catalyse healthy development. The wholesale ban on mobile phone use in school is destined to fail and risks blinding parents and educators to potential benefits the technology has to offer, for it overlooks the value of mobile phones as objects of ‘passion’ and ‘reason’, ignores the opportunity to engage with teens who make visible online the problems they struggle with offline, and disregards the need for empathic imagination.",TRUE,FALSE,Adolescent|Care|China|High School|Smartphone|Wellbeing,2018-07-02T11:06:45.521508,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-10T15:44:35.813634,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/citation/,gk4c8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tghbk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/relationships/node/,tghbk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598c7e4c594d9002391cee7d/,598c7e4c594d9002391cee7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gk4c8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gk4c8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gk4c8,https://doi.org/10.1080/02671522.2019.1601757
