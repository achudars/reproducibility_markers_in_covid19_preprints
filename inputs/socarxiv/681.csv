Differences in skills distributions and the labor market disadvantage of less-educated adults across 21 countries,"Less-educated adults bear the highest risk of labor market marginalization in all advanced economies, but the extent of their disadvantage differs considerably across countries. Exploiting unique data on the actual skills of adults from PIAAC 2011/12, we examine two prominent explanations for this cross-country variation. Human capital theory suggests that the marginalization of less-educated individuals reflects a lack of skills. The signaling explanation emphasizes the role of educational credentials as easy-to-observe proxies for skills and productivity. It suggests that the skills distribution of educational groups can affect their labor market position beyond any individual-level effect of skills by influencing the signaling value or “skills transparency” of educational credentials. Applying a two-step regression approach to a sample of 48,033 adults in 21 countries, we find support for both explanations. Consistent with human capital theory, literacy and numeracy skills are positively related to occupational status at the individual level and partly account for cross-national differences in the labor market disadvantage of less-educated adults. Yet, cross-country variation remains considerable even after controlling for skills and further key observables. Consistent with the signaling account, country-level regressions show that the remaining variation is related to two direct measures of skills transparency: the aggregate skills differential between less- and intermediate-educated adults and the internal homogeneity of these groups. We also find that the labor market disadvantage of less-educated adults increases with the vocational orientation of secondary education, presumably reflecting individual- and aggregate-level effects of occupation-specific skills, which were not assessed in PIAAC.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Inequality|International comparison|Labor market|PIAAC|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:47.324662,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-09T11:56:25.875000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",by the authors,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/citation/,wc4s9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8jb4r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/relationships/node/,8jb4r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584a9878b83f6901f6ad26ea/,584a9878b83f6901f6ad26ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wc4s9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wc4s9,NA

This paper examines an emerging effort in South Africa to counter this fragmentation: the United Front project, initiated and led by the National Union of Metalworkers South Africa (NUMSA). Drawing on 74 interviews conducted at two different NUMSA-led protests in Johannesburg, the analysis unpacks two sets of tensions. One set of tensions revolves around class politics, which pertain to the divide between unionized workers in relatively stable employment, and impoverished communities ravaged by unemployment. The other set of tensions revolves around party politics, including divisions with respect to the United Front's opposition to the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC). Each dimension reveals both crucial sources of solidarity and potential obstacles, showing that forging a broad working-class unity in the current period is complex, but not impossible.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:45:11.249187,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-08T21:11:28.790000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",The Sociological Review,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/citation/,3b7sw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4ne3n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/relationships/node/,4ne3n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5849cbeb594d900200560465/,5849cbeb594d900200560465,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3b7sw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3b7sw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3b7sw,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.12405/abstract

The author uses the perceptions of a sample of successful Taiwanese immigrant parents regarding marriageable partners for their children to examine how integration can result in resistance to intermarriage with whites. An analytical framework called marital boundaries is proposed to show how differences between ‘marriageable us’ and ‘undesirable them’ are perceived by individuals who occupy different family positions. Data from 37 interviews with highly achieving Taiwan-origin immigrants residing in San Diego reveal a long-term effect of homeland politics on their Asian-centered hierarchies for preferred marriage partners for their children. Impacted by a growing sense of Taiwanese nationalism starting in the 1970s, many interviewees described a moral line between different Asian groups that helped them define their marital boundaries. The data provide evidence of a tendency among Asian immigrants to follow segmented assimilation paths based in part on transnational influences. The findings challenge assumptions found in the immigration literature that define intermarriage with whites as a form of social mobility, as well as descriptions of Asians as a single homogeneous category.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:48:29.522339,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-08T08:19:27.211000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/citation/,cpxh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wdvnt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/relationships/node/,wdvnt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584917509ad5a102066b4631/,584917509ad5a102066b4631,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cpxh8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cpxh8,NA

Why? This paper uses the Pakistani experience with power sector reforms to illustrate how the donor-led reform agenda had readily apparent shortcomings. A new wave of development thinking responds to such failures by drawing on complexity theory and moving toward more local, iterative and experimental approaches.

Insiders follow a local punishment rule, shunning the outsider if it has cheated them or a neighbor. The object of interest is that the outsider may know either summary statistics about the nature of the network, or know its precise non-anonymous structure. For the outsider to have knowledge of the precise structure may, depending on the shape of the network, increase or decrease the volume of honest interaction that can be sustained. In extreme cases, a small `local' vulnerability to outside exploitation can result in a total breakdown of the chance for mutually beneficial trade across the whole network. Strategic ignorance and obfuscation of network structure may therefore be valuable to both sides, complicating the problem for a network operator seeking to monetize data on the network graph.

We argue that sociologists’ formation stories have been mischaracterized as noncausal, descriptive, or interpretive. Traditional “forcing-cause” accounts describe regularized relations between fixed entities with specific properties. The three dominant approaches to causality—variable causality, treatments and manipulations, and mechanisms—all refer to forcing causes. But formation stories do not fit the forcing-causes framework because accounts of formation violate the assumptions that ground forcing-cause accounts and instead emphasize eventfulness, assemblage, and self-representation. Yet these accounts are, we argue, fundamentally causal. In particular, formation stories provide the historical, empirical boundaries for the functioning of forcing-cause accounts. We catalog the breadth of formation stories in sociology and use examples from diverse literatures to highlight how thinking of formation stories as causal accounts can improve our understanding of the relationship of history and culture to causal analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,causality|formation|historical sociology|mechanisms,2018-07-02T10:46:28.864425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-07T18:25:53.836000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/citation/,6pd4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h89hv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/relationships/node/,h89hv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584853a39ad5a10205486917/,584853a39ad5a10205486917,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pd4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6pd4x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6pd4x,https://doi.org/10.1177/0735275114558632

Focusing on depressive symptoms as an outcome and using multilevel modeling, results from analysis of four waves of data (n = 4,340 person-waves) from the American Changing Lives Survey (ACL) shows that differences in depressive symptoms between never married and married adults varies by household income. Depressive symptoms are highest among the never married, and differences from the married greatest, at the lowest levels of income. As income increases these differences are eliminated. The interaction between income and marriage is partially mediated by financial strain, self-efficacy, and social support from friends and relatives.
