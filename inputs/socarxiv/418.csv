I can also get a conclusion that Zhangshan Hill(嶂山)means Egypt governor or pharaoh had come to Wuxi. 
Besides, we can get a conclusion that Chanshan Hill(产山)is a man-made pyramid, and Heliekou(河埒口)means enclosure around the man-made pyramid- Chanshan Hill, this pyramid complex looks like Djoser's Pyramid Complex which has enclosure around it. From the paper, we can conclude that Huishan clay figurines（惠山泥人）are ushabtis with Chinese characteristic, it indicates that Wuxi（无锡）was the colony of ancient Egypt. So Wuxi（无锡）means binding spot, Mount Xi（锡山）means a binding hill. And the ruins of Mount Xi(锡山) resemble ""Pyramid of Khufu"" in Giza pyramid complex. So we can get a hypothesis that Mount Xi(锡山) is a man-made pyramid.

We focus on 30 Natural Geographic Areas (NGAs) distributed over 10 major world regions (Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Eurasia, North America, South America, and Oceania). The conceptual framework that we use to obtain these estimates combines the influences of the production technologies (and how they change with time), climate change, and effects of artificial selection into a Relative Yield Coefficient, indicating how agricultural productivity changed over time in each NGA between the Neolithic and the 20th century. We then use estimates of historical yield in each NGA to translate the Relative Yield Coefficient into an Estimated Yield (tonnes per hectare per year) trajectory. We tested the proposed methodology in two ways. For eight NGAs, in which we had more than one historical yield estimate, we used the earliest estimate to anchor the trajectory and compared the ensuing trajectory to the remaining estimates. We also compared the end points of the estimated NGA trajectories to the earliest (the 1960s decade) FAO data on crop productivities in the modern countries encompassing Seshat NGAs.

This has required a shift in the procurement of organs sourced from China’s prison and security apparatus to hospital-based voluntary donors declared dead by neurological and/or circulatory criteria. Chinese officials announced that from January 1, 2015, hospital-based donors would be the sole source of organs. This paper examines the availability, transparency, integrity, and consistency of China’s official transplant data.

Methods: Forensic statistical methods were used to examine key deceased organ donation data sets from 2010 to 2018 . Two central-level datasets — published by the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS) and the Red Cross Society of China — are tested for evidence of manipulation, including conformance to simple mathematical formulae, arbitrary internal ratios, the presence of anomalous data artefacts, and cross-consistency. Provincial-level data in five regions are tested for coherence, consistency, and plausibility, and individual hospital data in those provinces are examined for consistency with provincial-level data. 

Results: COTRS data conforms almost precisely to a mathematical formula (which first appeared to be a general quadratic, but with further confirmatory data was discovered to be a simpler one-parameter quadratic) while Central Red Cross data mirrors it, albeit imperfectly. The analysis of both datasets suggests human-directed data manufacture and manipulation. Contradictory, implausible, or anomalous data artefacts were found in five provincial datasets, suggesting that these data may have been manipulated to enforce conformity with central quotas. A number of the distinctive features of China's current organ procurement and allocation system are discussed, including apparent misclassification of nonvoluntary donors as voluntary.

Conclusion: A variety of evidence points to systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets and the misclassification of donors in China. This takes place alongside genuine voluntary organ transplant activity, which is often incentivized by large cash payments. These findings are relevant for international interactions with China’s organ transplantation system.",TRUE,FALSE,data falsification|organ donation|organ transplantation|organ transplantation in China|statistical forensics|transplant ethics,2019-01-31T19:48:28.698947,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-31T19:48:06.907293,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/citation/,zxgec,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a9w5b/,a9w5b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c520caf568329001d81de5b/,5c520caf568329001d81de5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxgec/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zxgec/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zxgec,NA

This essay explores the similarities of 52 small-city gay bars to each other, and their differences from big-city gayborhood bars. Small-city gay bars are surprisingly integrated with straight people in their often red-state communities and are as racially diverse than the counties in which they reside. They are subcultural amenities not just for LGBT people but for straights as well, fostering cosmopolitan lifestyles for large geographical regions. 

I conclude with an argument for the importance of small cities to understand urbanism generally. Small cities are a key analytic object to disentangle urban effects from modern life generally. They reveal the way in which contemporary urban scholars often implicitly define urbanism in terms of commercial diversity at the expense of the reasons why many people prefer to live in small cities: proximity to kin or nature, and the fact that most big-city pleasures can be found everywhere. Studying small cities provides one way of integrating studies along the urban-rural interface and developing a more holistic, empirically rich, and theoretically sound sociology of place.",TRUE,FALSE,gay bars|LGBT|placemaking|rural|small cities|urbanism|urban-rural interface,2019-01-31T12:05:41.509981,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-31T12:05:13.573220,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/citation/,s364v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c51f0b2568329001b851359/,5c51f0b2568329001b851359,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s364v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s364v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s364v,NA

However, our understanding of the design mechanisms that support user self-control remains limited. In this paper, we make two contributions to HCI research in this space: first, we analyse 367 apps and browser extensions from the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores to identify common core design features and intervention strategies afforded by current tools for digital self-control. Second, we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found. Our analysis aims to help the design of better tools in two ways: (i) by identifying how, through a well-established model of self-regulation, current tools overlap and differ in how they support self-control; and (ii) by using the model to reveal underexplored cognitive mechanisms that could aid the design of new tools.",TRUE,FALSE,addiction|attention|digital wellbeing|distraction|focus|human-computer interaction|ICT non-use|interruptions|self-control|self-regulation,2019-02-14T15:58:03.972154,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-14T15:57:47.474004,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/citation/,685tm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zyj4h/,zyj4h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c51df42bf723100197c5e89/,5c51df42bf723100197c5e89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/685tm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/685tm,https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300361

In this paper, we argue that these two lenses occlude smaller instances of activism during election periods and the influence that this protest has on bringing about gradual political change. To build our argument, we draw on two presidential elections held in Iran in 2009 and 2013. We show how grassroots activists use elections to abort gains made by hard-liners, push centrist and moderate candidates toward more reformist and democratic stances, promote issues that would otherwise be considered beyond the pale of formal regime politics, and encourage solidarity and opposition coalition building.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-30T15:59:48.658183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-30T15:57:01.235906,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/citation/,ukycp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c51c0b90d1c9e001a4e098b/,5c51c0b90d1c9e001a4e098b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ukycp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ukycp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ukycp,NA
