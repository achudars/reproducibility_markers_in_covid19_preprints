It also identifies the difficulties faced by the students in their reading comprehension classes to have a holistic view of learning process. The main aim of the study is to explore the issues related to teaching reading, both from teachers as well as learners’ perspectives, so that the best teaching strategies can be adopted to achieve the desired outcomes. It assesses the ongoing prevalent scenario of learning to read in English as foreign language and observes that the learners’ difficulties are not addressed properly because the teachers/instructors are not trained well or pay less attention to reading skill. A descriptive approach has been used on a sample of instructors from various non-native English-speaking nationalities (n=60) and Saudi learners (n=146). Responses revealed that teachers’ poor awareness of teaching strategies cause poor learning outcomes. Their responses also reveals that their strategies do not take into account learners’ difficulties which somewhere cause learners’ helplessness in getting desired outcome. The results of the study elaborate how the culture and contextual knowledge play significant roles. These are the bases of teaching reading skills along with learners’ needs so that more robust teaching strategies can be followed to truly meet the desired learning outcomes. This will definitely help the teacher-educators as well as the instructors in improvising their teaching practices that suit their classrooms well.",TRUE,FALSE,comprehension|EFL instructors|EFL reading|reading strategies|Saudi learners,2019-07-21T21:28:48.734193,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:28:27.712648,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/citation/,624nr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bece6a26b3400170a3a17/,5d2bece6a26b3400170a3a17,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/624nr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/624nr/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.23,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/624nr

Political discourse is a popular area of research of linguistics, as it covers all aspects of modern life and society. Being mainly broadcasted by the politicians, it is considered a complex linguistic phenomenon, whose objectives, direct or indirect, are aimed at disseminating, implementing political authorities and obtaining the majority of votes during the election campaigns. The article is devoted to the evaluation categories, which refer to the semantic and pragmatic categories and can be one of the strongest tools of influence on the public. Within the framework of our research 29 English articles, posted on the Internet, concerning the political leaders of the United States and Great Britain, attributing the personal characteristics to them, were analysed.

The role of memorization and repetition of English language structures has always been a dominant teaching attitude. This attitude has revealed unsuccessful results in promoting speaking proficiency among English language learners when communicating in real-world situations beyond the classroom context. Therefore, it is essential to address such practices and shed light on some of the issues that hinder English Language Learners (ELLs) from effectively using English in real-world communicative situations. This review paper focuses on ELT practices that have been unsuccessful in promoting English language learners’ speaking proficiency. Additionally, it provides implications for classroom teaching instructions that integrate authentic tasks and materials. Implementing meaningful tasks that represent real-world situations could be a promising solution for enhancing ELLs’ language competencies to enable them to transfer the language they learn to real-life situations beyond school settings.

Readability is a practical consideration when making decisions on materials to match a text with target readers’ proficiency.  However, few studies have compared the readability levels of teaching and testing materials in terms of the difficulty of passages.  The present study, therefore, aims to explore the readability levels and the linguistic characteristics of reading passages in English textbooks and the Thai National Education English Test based on three readability formulas and eight aspects of linguistic characteristics as provided by the Coh-Metrix computational tool.  Two sets of corpora were generated and analyzed by using Coh-Metrix as the main instrument.  The obtained data from the reading passages compiled in the English textbooks and the Thai national education English test were compared to explore the significant differences.  The results revealed a mismatch in the readability levels and linguistic characteristics.  Passages from the English textbooks are easier than those used in the English test.  It is recommended that all stakeholders in both teaching and testing administration be aware of the different levels of readability between reading passages.  More considerations should be made when preparing the teaching and testing materials because a suitable difficulty level will ensure that students receive the most benefit from the materials.

Besides, a checklist was used to determine students’ level of awareness of these errors. As a result, a program based on some metacognitive strategies was developed to raise students’ awareness of syntactic and semantic errors to improve their translation performance. Metacognition awareness went through five stages of preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and expansion. Students worked together in the process of translation to translate the given passages. They worked in pairs to proofread their translation by identifying their errors, correcting them, and finally editing their final copy.

To achieve the aim of the study, 40 ESP College students were randomly chosen from the college of political sciences at A-Nahrain University in Iraq, the participants were in the second grade during the academic year 2017-2018. Two groups were enrolled in this experiment, 20 ESP students in the experimental group and the same number in the control group. To determine if the intensive reading strategy had an impact on ESP student's in developing vocabulary, a pre-posttest was administered for both groups. The control group was treated by the traditional way of teaching vocabulary through translating the words in Arabic language and memorizing them with the help of the teacher, while the experimental group was treated by using intensive reading strategy for about ten weeks. The chosen texts were taken from (New Head way Pre-intermediate student's book). Fill in the blank exercises had been chosen in the pre-posttest which consist of 50 items for each, the test was administered by the researcher. Based on the findings of this research, it was found that the new strategy has a positive impact on ESP College students' in mastering vocabulary that was proven from the improvement of students’ mean score from pretest to posttest. Based on the results gained; it is recommended that intensive reading strategy can play a great role in mastering vocabulary.",TRUE,FALSE,English for specific purposes|intensive reading|vocabulary,2019-07-21T21:22:03.035413,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:21:39.108643,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/citation/,ytfe3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2be2b845253a001c41bdcf/,5d2be2b845253a001c41bdcf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytfe3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytfe3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ytfe3

The data are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively with the aim of finding the most frequent responses that denote refusal by the English native speakers. Most of the expressions used to reflect the British people’s annoyance with the use of cold calls, the majority being brief phrases of refusal. In addition to the recorded calls, two questionnaires were conducted in Britain to shed light on the frequent expressions used on the phone in response to the salesperson. It is interesting here to catalog the range of strategies used by individuals, most of the time verbal, to avoid talking to the salesperson. These strategies seem to exist on a continuum of directness-indirectness. Firstly to perform an act of refusal efficient enough to end the call. Secondly to make the balance between the impacts of refusal per se and the keeping up with the social convention of mutual cooperation presented in the theory of politeness.",TRUE,FALSE,phone conversation|politeness theory|refusal|salesperson-customer|speech act,2019-07-21T21:21:41.915123,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:21:17.386063,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/citation/,bmeyk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2be1fa1c5b4a001aa47156/,5d2be1fa1c5b4a001aa47156,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bmeyk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bmeyk
