They also make clear that these companies are unlikely to disclose their practices and often go to great lengths to keep them hidden. At the same time, however, these companies are responsible for wide-reaching, influential phenomena that should be of core interest to scholars of information technology. While scholars’ methodologies and ethical conventions have tended to privilege the agency of research participants and focused on the prevention of harm, we argue that the current landscape calls for a reevaluation of these conventions. Specifically, we consider here what it would mean for researchers to take a more investigative approach by seeking to discover and reveal information that the subjects of the research would prefer to remain unknown.

A Novel Test of Ethnic Competition Theory,"Whether labor market competition is shaping anti-immigration attitudes is a contentious issue. We conduct a novel test of ethnic competition theory by comparing the attitudes towards immigration of workers with fixed-term contracts to those with permanent jobs in Europe. Fixed-term contract workers are particularly at risk of competition as they have to compete for jobs in the foreseeable future. In the first step of our investigation, we analyze cross-sectional data (ESS, 2002–18) from 18 Western European countries. We find that—contrary to our expectation—fixed-term workers are less anti-immigration. The effect is substantively small. In the second step, we use a fixed-effects design with longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP, 1999–2015) to rule out time-constant unobserved heterogeneity. We find that transitioning from a fixed- to a permanent contract does not affect anti-immigration attitudes. Our combined results thus add to the evidence against labor market competition as an explanation of anti-immigrant attitudes.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-08T01:24:26.323952,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T01:24:11.958364,NA,NA,available,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DY6N2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/citation/,42xbp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dy6n2/,dy6n2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dea930fa7db99000a51604d/,5dea930fa7db99000a51604d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42xbp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42xbp

The standard historiography of clinical trials, at least in Britain, is built around the trial of streptomycin as a treatment for tuberculosis organised by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) in the late 1940s. A series of clinical trials took place in Glasgow in the 1930s which doesn’t feature in the standard account. The reasons for their exclusion, and why they did take place, are the subject of this paper.

In recovering the context in which the Glasgow clinical trials took place three factors stand out. Firstly, the practice operated by the Glasgow Corporation of treating most cases of skin infection by hospitalising patients. Secondly, the high degree of interconnectivity between voluntary and state-funded hospitals in Glasgow at the time. Thirdly, the belief of Thomas Anderson in the value of biometry as a basis for evaluating therapies.

These factors can be given names. The first is the moral economy of medicine - the practice of establishing fever and isolation hospitals as part of hospital provision in Glasgow in the nineteenth century. The second is the political economy of medicine - the relationships among doctors, especially the degree of interconnectedness between the health systems associated with the University of Glasgow and the Corporation of Glasgow. The third is the mathematization of causality - in this case, the biometric sensibilities of Thomas Anderson: his understanding of, expertise, and belief in, the efficacy of quantification as a means of progress in scientific medicine.",TRUE,FALSE,Clinical Trials|Fever Hospitals|Glasgow|John Brownlee|Medical-Policing|Medical Research Council|Prontosil|Randomisation|Ruchill Hospital|Thomas Anderson|United Kingdom,2019-12-08T01:18:22.787471,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T01:18:09.178792,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/citation/,a9jzc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dea82bba7db99000c5181bb/,5dea82bba7db99000c5181bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a9jzc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a9jzc

In spite of accusations of bias and invalidity, student evaluations of teaching have dominated teaching evaluation at U.S. universities. However, studies on the topic have tended to be limited to particular institutional and disciplinary contexts.  Moreover, in spite of the idealistic assumption that research and teaching are mutually beneficial, few studies have examined the link between research performance and student evaluations of teaching.  In this study, we conduct a large scale exploratory analysis of the factors associated with student evaluations of teachers, controlling for heterogeneous institutional and disciplinary contexts.  We source public student evaluations of teaching fromRateMyProfessor.comand information regarding career and contemporary research performance indicators from the companyAcademicAnalytics.  The factors most associated with higher student ratings were the attractiveness of the faculty and the student’s interest in the class; the factors most associated with lower student ratings were course difficulty and whether student comments mentioned an accent or a teaching assistant.  Moreover, faculty tended to be rated more highly when they were young, male, White, in the Humanities, and held arank of full professor.  We observed little to no evidence of any relationship, positive or negative, between student evaluations of teaching and research performance.

We interpret a failure to keep up with parental social class (i.e. downward mobility) as an indicator that individual’s status achievements lag behind expectations and contribute to subjective feelings of loss and decline. An innovative feature of this paper is that we investigate both whether individual’s mobility experience -- micro level -- and also whether opportunity structures -- mobility on a macro level -- are linked with attitudes towards immigration. In contexts with high downward-mobility, opportunities for moving up are limited and hence perceived economic decline and loss might lead to more hostility towards immigrants. By contrast, high upward mobility expands opportunities for all and as such might promote positive attitudes towards immigrants. We use the European Social Survey data (2002-10) and conduct analyses on 30 countries using diagonal reference models that allow the effects of individual mobility trajectory to be disentangled from origin status and destination status. Our results show that the working classes hold stronger anti-immigration attitudes and parental class continues to exert an effect on attitudes in adulthood even after accounting for individual’s own social class position. Being downwardly mobile from parental class does not appear to be associated with more hostility towards immigrants, except in a few European countries like Italy, Poland, and Greece. Our random-effects meta-regression models show, however, that people living in contexts of high downward mobility are more hostile towards immigrants compared to people in contexts with high upward mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-08T00:59:03.395912,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T00:58:44.290608,NA,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TPXBH,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/citation/,yxe7u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpxbh/,tpxbh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dea53dceb3ee6000c8a6dbe/,5dea53dceb3ee6000c8a6dbe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yxe7u/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2020.100543,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yxe7u

Las editoras de este libro me propusieron desarrollar un texto que se dirigiera a las y los investigadores y profesionales que se enfrentan con la literatura publicada y con el diseño de investigación. Lo haré a partir del cruce interdisciplinario de algunas áreas: lectura, bibliotecas penitenciarias, sociología de la cultura y de la vida penitenciaria. Mi reciente participación en un seminario en la Facultad de Ciencias de la Documentación y la Comunicación, de la Universidad de Extremadura, Badajoz1 y el debate entre colegas que allí tuvo lugar, crearon el momento propicio para que yo retome este tema. Para evitar redundancias en relación a lo que ya he dicho, apunto para mis trabajos publicados donde algunos de los problemas que plantearé ya fueron abordados en detalle. Paralelamente me referiré a alguna literatura que considero es una buena base para un estudio profundo de temas más polémicos o menos divulgados",TRUE,FALSE,female prisons|feminist epistemologies|gender bias|methodology|reading|romance novels|social class bias,2019-12-08T00:48:00.856976,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T00:47:37.700584,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/citation/,q35ba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de95723a7db99000c50466d/,5de95723a7db99000c50466d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q35ba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q35ba/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q35ba

Yet it is ill understood, partly because of a lack of quantification. Here, we leverage large datasets of individual biographies to build national estimates of scientific production during the early modern period. While aggregate levels of national production are unsurprising, per capita estimates reveal striking differences across countries, with the two richest countries of the time (England and the United Provinces) being much more scientifically productive than the rest of Europe. Overall, our study demonstrates a strong association between scientific creativity and per capita income. We also show that scientific creativity is associated with other kinds of creative activities in philosophy, literature, music and the arts, suggesting a common underlying factor. Our results also challenge long-held hypotheses regarding the role of religion, universities, demography, and the printing press, and support the idea that economic development and rising living standards are key to explaining the rise of modern science.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural evolution|Economic development|GDP per capita|Living standard|Scientific revolution,2019-12-06T11:07:25.612891,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-06T11:07:10.326629,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/citation/,9ex8q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de94f03a7db99000b5038bb/,5de94f03a7db99000b5038bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ex8q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ex8q/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ex8q

Yet, existing theories struggle to explain why (some) individuals engage with politics as an end in itself even if the behavior does not produce any separable instrumental value. Integrating psychological theories from motivation studies, this study deduces a need-based model of political motivation in order to explain intrinsic political engagement. The model proposes that intrinsic political motivation has roots in the seemingly apolitical processes of need satisfaction which are deeply ingrained in the human psyche. Providing a theoretical framework for existing political science findings, this study argues that citizens seek behaviors they previously experienced as pleasurable. Differences in intrinsic political motivation are therefore theorized to reflect whether political engagement was previously experienced as satisfying basic psychological needs which is argued to predict both whether and how individuals engage with politics. By manipulating need-related situational features before and during political engagement, a pre-registered survey experiment tested the basic tenet that need-related experiences with politics affect the quality and quantity of future activities in the political domain. However, 15 out of 15 analytical tests do not yield the expected evidence in line with the need-based model of political motivation. Showcasing a step-wise approach for dealing with null-results in hypothesis-driven research to assess and increase the information value of the conducted analysis, the presented evidence calls into question the accuracy of the presented theory and the previous insights in psychology and political science on which it was built. This study thus adds a new piece to the puzzle of understanding what does and what does not underlie intrinsic motivation for political engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,Civic Engagement|Cognitive Processing|Expectancy Value Theory|Motivation Studies|Open Science|Political Participation|Rational Choice Theory|Self-determination theory,2019-12-05T18:18:02.530772,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-05T18:17:38.130165,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/citation/,347zn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7m4gd/,7m4gd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de92a1884c479000b78654f/,5de92a1884c479000b78654f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/347zn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/347zn
