These relationships are hierarchical and rigid at early stages, but over time evolve into more collaborative partnerships.

Evidence from France,"Grasslands, especially when extensively managed and when replacing croplands, store Green-House Gases. As a result, Grassland Conservation Programs, that pay farmers for maintaining grassland cover, might be an effective way to combat climate change, if they succeed in triggering an increase in grassland cover for a reasonable amount of money. In this paper, we use a natural experiment to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the French Grassland Conservation Program, the largest of such programs in the world. We exploit a change in the eligibility requirements for the program that generated a sizable increase in the proportion of participants in the communes most affected by the program. We find that the expansion of the program leads to a small in- crease in grassland area, mainly at the expense of croplands, which implies that the program expansion increased carbon storage. We estimate that the climate benefits from the program are at most equal to 19%±37% of its costs. The program is thus not cost-effective for fighting climate change, especially when compared with forest conservation programs in developing countries whose benefits have been estimated to exceed costs by a factor of two. When taking into account the other benefits brought about by grassland, we find the benefits of the program to be equal to 32%±62% of its costs.",TRUE,FALSE,Grassland|Natural Experiment|Payment for Ecosystem Services|Treatment Effect.,2019-06-27T17:25:46.624353,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-27T17:25:24.246885,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/citation/,cx8j6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9puzn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/relationships/node/,9puzn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d14b88d70291a001c699560/,5d14b88d70291a001c699560,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cx8j6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cx8j6

Na formulação clássica de Max Weber, eles representam dimensões analiticamente distintas, ainda que correlacionadas, da estratificação, que podem influenciar diferentes esferas da vida social. Este trabalho explora a distinção entre as dimensões de classe e status no Brasil contemporâneo, dedicando especial atenção à questão da operacionalização desses conceitos de forma apropriada à pesquisa empírica. Mais especificamente, utilizo dados da Pesquisa das Dimensões Sociais das Desigualdades (PDSD) de 2008 para analisar, pela primeira vez, a estrutura ocupacional das amizades no Brasil e estimar, a partir dela, uma hierarquia ocupacional que interpreto como um indicador de status. Dessa forma, adoto a estratégia de construir uma escala de status que tem em seu centro a noção de distância social, em detrimento de atributos socioeconômicos ou avaliações subjetivas de prestígio. Essa escala de status está associada, sobretudo, com a educação, tanto no nível individual quanto no dos grupos ocupacionais. Ela também é altamente correlacionada a escalas de status mais tradicionais, mas apresenta discrepâncias compatíveis com sua interpretação substantiva. Além disso, a distinção entre trabalho manual e não manual parece determinante tanto na disposição dos grupos sociais ao longo da dimensão de status quanto na relação desta com as classes sociais. De forma geral, os resultados reforçam a ideia de que classe e status capturam diferentes aspectos da estrutura das desigualdades. /// Class and status are the basic concepts underlying most sociological research on inequality, stratification and social mobility. In Max Weber’s classic definition, they represent distinct, although correlated, dimensions of social stratification, that may have effects in different aspects of social life. This work explores the distinction between the class and status dimensions in contemporary Brazil, paying special attention to matters of operationalization of these concepts for purposes of empirical research. I use data from the Social Dimensions of Inequality survey (2008) to analyze, for the first time, the occupational structure of friendship in Brazil and estimate from it an occupational hierarchy that we regard as an indicator of status. Therefore, I take an approach of constructing a status scale that relies on the notion of social distance, rather than socioeconomic features of occupations or subjective evaluations of prestige. This scale is mainly associated with education, both on the individual and occupational levels. It is also highly correlated with more traditional status scales, but shows some discrepancies that are compatible with its substantive interpretation. The distinction between manual and non manual work seems to play a key role both on the rank ordering of occupational groups on the status scale and the relationship between status and social classes.

Given these two observations, we test the hypothesis that schooling may attenuate the genetic predisposition to poor mental health. Specifically, we estimate associations between a polygenic score (PGS) for depressive symptoms, schooling attainment and gene-environment (GxE) interactions with mental health (depressive symptoms and depression), in two distinct United States datasets at different adult ages- 29 years old in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and 54 years old in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). OLS results indicate that the association of the PGS with mental health is similar in Add Health and the WLS, but the association of schooling attainment is much larger in Add Health than in the WLS. There is some suggestive evidence that the association of the PGS with mental health is lower for more-schooled older individuals in the WLS, but there is no evidence of any significant GxE associations in Add Health. Quantile regression estimates also show that in the WLS the GxE associations are statistically significant only in the upper parts of the conditional depressive symptoms score distribution. We assess the robustness of the OLS results to omitted variable bias by using the siblings samples in both datasets to estimate sibling fixed-effect regressions. The sibling fixed-effect results must be qualified, in part due to low statistical power. However, the sibling fixed-effect estimates show that college education is associated with fewer depressive symptoms in both datasets.",TRUE,FALSE,gene-environment interactions|mental health|polygenic scores|schooling,2019-06-26T21:10:47.884365,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26T21:10:33.575074,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,None,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/citation/,wjp5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d13ac82e200da00186fea1e/,5d13ac82e200da00186fea1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjp5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wjp5v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wjp5v

Couples were more likely to report that one person managed the shared pot of money in countries with high gender inequality compared with couples in more gender equal countries. This pattern was not moderated by within-couple earnings equality. We found a cohabitation—marriage gap in income arrangements that is largest where national-level gender equality is high. In more gender equal contexts, married couples were more likely to pool and manage their money together, whereas a larger proportion of married couples assigned one money manager in countries with less gender equality. Cohabiting couples were more likely to keep some money separate than to take-up a pooled, jointly managed approach in more gender equal countries. Findings demonstrate the need to consider both management and pooling dimensions of couples’ treatment of money to understand the influence of contextual factors on couples’ income arrangements.",TRUE,FALSE,cohabitation|gender inequality|intrahousehold finances|marriage,2019-06-26T14:06:45.099098,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26T14:06:28.449365,NA,NA,available,NA,https://www.gesis.org/en/issp/modules/issp-modules-by-topic/family-and-changing-gender-roles/2012,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/citation/,nd6rb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yexwp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/relationships/node/,yexwp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d1379f765ffa5001a20e423/,5d1379f765ffa5001a20e423,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd6rb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nd6rb/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10834-020-09717-5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nd6rb

However, students who are culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) or gifted and disabled are also underrepresented but are often excluded from analysis. A cross-sectional design was to evaluate gifted enrollment data gathered by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), using the Civil Rights Data Collection Series (CRDC). Proportional representation in GATE enrollment assessed students’ race/ethnicity, English Language Learner (ELL) status, and disability status under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). A one-sample z test of proportions rendered statistically significant disproportionality across all groups evaluated. Results indicate the issue driving disproportionality lies within the theory of intelligence used to measure giftedness in Western school systems and calls for correctly diagnosing the GATE systems’ underlying inequities.",TRUE,FALSE,CLD|disproportionality|ELL|fluid intelligence|GATE|twice-exceptional,2019-06-26T09:55:44.635346,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26T09:49:43.175474,FALSE,NA,no,The present study was a secondary analysis and the data used is available at https://ocrdata.ed.gov,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d54|Education|Elementary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d57|Education|Gifted Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd2|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Counseling|Counselor Education",Allison List,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/citation/,s6tqx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d12c80ae200da00197166a4/,5d12c80ae200da00197166a4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6tqx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s6tqx/,https://doi.org/10.1080/1045988X.2020.1837061,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s6tqx
