In particular, consensus is lacking on how to conceptualize different aspects of sexual wellbeing among young people. We propose a new conceptual framework for adolescent sexual wellbeing that draws on existing theories and definitions, grounded in theories related to positive youth development, empowerment, human rights, gender, social-ecological and life-course perspectives. The framework highlights six interrelated domains of key competencies that are central to healthy adolescent sexuality development, whether or not sexual activities occur: 1) sexual literacy, 2) gender equal attitudes, 3) respect for human rights and understanding consent, 4) critical reflection skills, 5) coping skills and 6) interpersonal skills. These competencies have the potential both to strengthen and impede adolescents’ sexual wellbeing in relation to both themselves and others. Personal sexual wellbeing includes, but is not limited to, having a positive sense of one’s own (sexual) self and body, and recognising and appreciating feelings of pleasure and desire. Relational sexual wellbeing can include developing and maintaining mutually respectful, gender equal relationships with other people that are that are part of young people’s sexual socialisation, such as peers, parents and community members. Over time, relational sexual wellbeing may also include outcomes related to intimate partners, such as equality in relationships, safe and pleasurable sexual interactions, free from violence and coercion. Whether young people are able to translate competencies into desired actions and achieve a sense of sexual wellbeing depends on the personal, social and economic resources available to them, their (sexual) agency, and on the influence of opportunity structures such as policies, laws and norms. We end with discussing the potential implications of the framework for public health programmes and research studies aiming to improve adolescent SRHR and wellbeing.",TRUE,FALSE,Adolescent|competencies|development|framework|positive approach|sexuality|sexual wellbeing|SRHR,2021-02-15T19:13:26.730324,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15T19:09:45.855090,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/translating-competencies-empowered-action.pdf,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Anna Kågesten and Miranda van Reeuwijk,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/citation/,9as6e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602a3069232383031f9df512/,602a3069232383031f9df512,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9as6e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9as6e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9as6e

This study also examines whether the impact of the family varies significantly by age. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, an event history analysis is conducted to address how the mechanisms of social learning by family affect the timing and types of first union formation.  This research shows an individual with lower parental relationship quality and parental divorce cohabit during adolescence and early adulthood to leave the familial conflict home environment.  Furthermore, intact family and higher relationship quality between parents are associated with a greater likelihood of marriage than cohabitation. This study suggests that parental divorce during adolescence affects the timing and types of the first union formation. In contrast, parental divorce in the later stage of the transition to adulthood is not associated with the first family formation behavior. Although young adults with different levels of parental relationship quality had the same rates of marriage, lower marital relationship quality is associated with higher rates of cohabitating. Adolescents who suffer from parental divorce and lower parental relationship quality with better socioeconomic status have lower rates of cohabitating but the same odds of marrying with lower socioeconomic status counterparts.

The results suggest that the programme will have the strongest impact on the incomes of households at the lower end of income distribution. Extreme consumption poverty in the whole population is reduced in the range from 35 to 37%, while child poverty in the range from 75 to 100%, depending on the choice of equivalence scale and assumptions about changes in household expenditures. The paper shows also that the programme will reduce the Gini index of income inequality in Poland by a few percentage points. The programme can lead to a lower risk of extreme poverty for households with children as compared to small households (e.g. single-person households). Analysis based on certain equivalence scales suggests that even before the implementation of the “Family 500+” programme extreme poverty among households with children was comparable or lower than among one-person or childless households.

In order to support this argument, they marshal data and observations from a single expanse of ADE, the archaeological site of Caldeirão, and disregard or misread other studies of ADEs in the Central Amazon region. Silva et al.'s claim, an epilogue to ‘geogenic’ models laid to rest over 40 years ago, also dismisses research showing how long-term anthropic soil enrichment occurs as a result of daily practices at contemporary indigenous settlements.

Fixed effects models show that as origin countries become more LGBT-friendly, we see more LGB immigrants from those countries in the U.S. On the individual level, immigrants in same-sex couples are more likely to live in progressive U.S. states, an effect that increases in strength as migrants come from for more LGBT-friendly countries of origin. We also find that, compared to different-sex immigrant couples, immigrants in same-sex couples come from richer, more democratic countries that are less represented in immigrant networks.

We study the impact of a 1996 law that created local government with electoral quotas for Scheduled Tribes, a historically marginalized and impoverished community of 100 million in India. Using difference-in-differences designs paired with remote sensing data on deforestation, we find that formal representation reduces the rate of deforestation by thirty percent. These effects are larger in villages close to mines, where representation likely lowered commercial extraction. Combining these findings with research that the same institutions improved economic outcomes, our results challenge the commonly held assumption that there must be a trade-off between development and protecting the environment. While conservation policy tends to comprise environmentally focused institutions, we suggest more attention be given to umbrella institutions, such as political representation, which can address conservation and development in tandem.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-15T19:24:01.441980,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15T19:21:41.291289,FALSE,NA,no,sources listed; substantial preprocessing required,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/citation/,3uvmc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6029769d23238302ec9d6653/,6029769d23238302ec9d6653,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3uvmc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3uvmc

What follows is the observation that these properties have their own system of relations, placed in the context of a culture of objects which engages a revealing process. An argument is presented for considering organization as the principle which allows for seepage, understood as an inherently informative and intuitive process where the organization of objects reveals some property and consequently makes us less uncertain about the object. Objects are deposited to be a continual process where the properties represented by the organization of its constituent parts change as they seep beyond its matrix. An object cannot inform us of all of its properties immediately, rather we acquaint ourselves with them as they are brought forth and become enframed as part of how we understand said object.",TRUE,FALSE,Alfred North Whitehead|Martin Heidegger|Metaphysics|objects|Ontology|Philosophy|Process Ontology|Technology,2021-02-15T19:25:42.811515,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15T19:22:55.704874,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics,Niel Bezrookove,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/citation/,hga6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6029452f73c9fe02f3075d63/,6029452f73c9fe02f3075d63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hga6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hga6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hga6y

This study explores how online news media in the Philippines and Malaysia depicted the outbreak of COVID-19 during the early period of its spread. The study analyzes the discourse around the outbreak based on a large corpus of Facebook news posts between January and March 2020. Using a corpus-based approach called Keyness Analysis, salient themes &amp; topics, and framings around the disease were identified and interpreted. The results show the differences in the reporting of the outbreak between the two countries. News reports in the Philippines depicted the disease in an enigmatic lens which explains the alarmist angle of news reports and the reassuring tone of the government, versus the war framing of Malaysian news that depicted the disease as an enemy to be fought and defeated. In reporting about the bid to contain the spread of the virus, Philippine news reports dealt mostly with the restrictions and regulations of movement while the Malaysian news covered more issues on personal hygiene and safety protocols. Lastly, concerns for Filipino seafarers and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) that needs to be repatriated was a recurring theme in Philippine news reports regarding COVID-19, while concerns for the economy was prominent in the Malaysian news reports. The study therefore shows that the depiction of COVID-19 in Malaysia and the Philippines are shaped by each country’s present social and political conditions.",TRUE,FALSE,corpus-based study|corpus linguistics|COVID-19|keyness analysis|news representation|online news|pandemic in news|Philippine media|Philippines,2021-02-15T19:27:01.583957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15T19:24:40.251183,FALSE,NA,no,A corpus of online news reports published by Philippine and Malaysian news media companies are used as data for this study.
