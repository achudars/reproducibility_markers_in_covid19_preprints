First, we classify Toronto neighbourhoods into distinct groups using established geodemographic segmentation techniques, a relatively novel application in this geographic setting.   Extending previous studies, we pursue a hierarchical approach to classifying neighbourhoods that situates many neighbourhood types within the city’s broader structure. Our hierarchical approach is able to incorporate a richer set of types than most past research and allows us to study how neighbourhoods' positions within this hierarchy shape their trajectories of change. Second, we use Markov models to identify generative processes that produce patterns of change in the city’s distribution of neighbourhood types. Moreover, we add a spatial component to the Markov process to uncover the extent to which change in one type of neighbourhood depends on the character of nearby neighbourhoods. In contrast to the few studies that have explored Markov models in this research tradition, we validate the model's predictive power. Third, we demonstrate how to use such models in theoretical scenarios considering the impact on the city’s predicted evolutionary trajectory when existing probabilities of neighbourhood transitions or distributions of neighbourhood types would hypothetically change. Markov models of transition patterns prove to be highly accurate in predicting the final distribution of neighbourhood types. Counterfactual scenarios empirically demonstrate urban complexity: small initial changes reverberate throughout the system, and unfold differently depending on their initial geographic distribution. These scenarios show the value of complexity as a framework for interpreting data and guiding scenario-based planning exercises.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-30T07:13:04.638374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-30T07:12:51.977471,FALSE,NA,no,It will be available soon.

A Comparative Analysis of National Discourses on the Digital Future of Work,"New forms of work intermediation - the gig economy - and the growing use of advanced digital technologies - the new knowledge economy - are changing the nature of work. The digitalization of work, however, is shaped by how countries respond to it. Following a discursive-institutionalist approach, we argue that to understand how countries respond to digitalization we need to understand how they perceive and conceive of it in the first place. Using various methods of quantitative text analysis on a novel corpus of translated newspaper and policy documents from eight European countries as well as qualitative evidence from interviews and secondary sources, we show that there are clear country effects in how digitalization is framed and fought over; that formal and informal institutions are crucial to understand these differences; but that actors can also use their discursive agency to defend or attack these institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital Capitalism|Digitalization|Discourse Analysis|Discursive Institutionalism|Future of Work|Text-as-Data,2020-10-30T15:54:01.990547,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-30T15:53:50.252894,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/citation/,6ex7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9aec71b1ea1703e2c946a1/,5f9aec71b1ea1703e2c946a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ex7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ex7t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ex7t,NA

Blau offered a powerful explanation: people connect with one another based on their positions in a social space. Yet a principled measure of social distance, allowing comparison within and between societies, remains elusive. We use the connectivity kernel of conditionally independent edge models to develop a family of segregation statistics with desirable properties: they offer an intuitive and universal characteristic scale on social space (facilitating comparison across datasets and societies), are applicable to multivariate and mixed node attributes, and capture segregation at the level of individuals, pairs of individuals and society as a whole. We show that the segregation statistics can induce a metric on Blau space (a space spanned by the attributes of the members of society) and provide maps of two societies. Under a Bayesian paradigm, we infer the parameters of the connectivity kernel from 11 ego-network datasets collected in four surveys in the UK and USA. The importance of different dimensions of Blau space is similar across time and location, suggesting a macroscopically stable social fabric. Physical separation and age differences have the most significant impact on segregation within friendship networks with implications for intergenerational mixing and isolation in later stages of life.",TRUE,FALSE,ego networks|inference|segregation|social networks,2020-10-30T07:14:23.433143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-30T07:13:57.021482,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-6614-13|https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=data&amp;p=showsurvey&amp;syid=86|https://gss.norc.org,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,Till Hoffmann and Nick S.

Choice of theme position indicates both the linguistic tools available to the writer and the structure being imposed across the text. Previous research suggests that manipulation of theme position can be challenging to learn but is important for ‘knowledge-transformation’ (Bereiter and Scardamalia 1987). In the light of social-semiotic research suggesting that young writers ‘re-make’ (Kress 1996, 228) those conventions which become socially or intellectually meaningful to them, this article reports on longitudinal research which used an analysis framework informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics  (SFL) to chart the evolution of theme use and modes of thematic progression in the writing of 24 children from the age of eight to eleven years. In particular, the research sought to identify potential ‘gateways’ (Halliday 1993) into new worlds of meaning afforded by alternative modes of thematic progression.

Selective Incentives, Production Functions, and Grievances","This article tests a theory of student protest based on collective action theories.  Drawing on rational choice theories of selective incentives, critical mass theories of production functions, and social psychological theories of protest, the present article specifies a theory of willingness to protest.  To test our model, we administer a factorial survey experiment of student protest to a random sample of undergraduate students.  We find that both the perceived likelihood of a protest’s success and one’s intention to protest are affected by the magnitude of the grievance, selective rewards and punishments, and the number of participants.  The latter effect suggests a decelerating production function.  Finally, we find that the likelihood of success mediates much of the effect of social context on intention to protest, implying that actors consider the effects of incentives not only on their own behavior but also on the behavior of others.",TRUE,FALSE,Collective action|Factorial survey experiment|Student protest,2020-10-29T02:00:24.356118,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-29T01:59:58.754828,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/citation/,z3myc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f99628c87b7df03293af497/,5f99628c87b7df03293af497,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z3myc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z3myc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z3myc,NA

So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from the Netherlands (n≈350,000). We use the fact that national exams took place before and after lockdown, and compare progress during this period to the same period in the three previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 weeks), and features an equitable system of school funding and the world's highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to a fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum entropy weights, or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress whilst learning from home, and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-29T01:59:42.141026,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-29T01:59:24.982199,FALSE,NA,no,,,available,NA,https://osf.io/mzc4w/?view_only=f9d557fb6df94457a1fb959fea3a83df,prereg_both,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/citation/,ve4z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f995b4687b7df03233b06fe/,5f995b4687b7df03233b06fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ve4z7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ve4z7,NA
