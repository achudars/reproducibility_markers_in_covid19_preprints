This paper discusses the troubled relationship between contemporary advertising technology (adtech) systems, in particular systems of real-time bidding (RTB, also known as programmatic advertising) underpinning much behavioural targeting on the web and through mobile applications. This paper analyses the extent to which practices of RTB are compatible with the requirements regarding (i) a legal basis for processing, transparency, and security in European data protection law. 
We first introduce the technologies at play through explaining and analysing the systems deployed online today. Following that, we turn to the law. Rather than analyse RTB against every provision of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we consider RTB in the context of the GDPR’s requirement of a legal basis for processing and the GDPR’s transparency and security requirements. We show, first, that the GDPR requires prior consent of the internet user for RTB, as other legal bases are not appropriate. Second, we show that it is difficult – and perhaps impossible – for website publishers and RTB companies to meet the GDPR’s transparency requirements. Third, RTB incentivises insecure data processing. 
We conclude that, in concept and in practice, RTB is structurally difficult to reconcile with European data protection law. Therefore, intervention by regulators is necessary.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-01T20:30:22.219076,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-01T20:29:55.370041,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law,The authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/citation/,wg8fq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y4gcj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/relationships/node/,y4gcj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6065d85b6f2ca100d28f4f69/,6065d85b6f2ca100d28f4f69,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg8fq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wg8fq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wg8fq,NA

The research area measuring ca. 50 km N–S by ca. 35 km E–W consists of flat alluvial plain in the north and gentle slope of the mountain foot in the south. The two seasons confirmed dozens of archaeological remains containing large scale cities/towns (e.g. Shish Tobe, Ak-Tobe Sretenskoe) and remarkable kurgans already known. Consequently, clear patterns of site distribution could provide critical implications for resolving the research issues.

I test these hypotheses with county-level regression models of 2016-to-2020 swing towards the Democratic presidential candidate, using the presence and intensity of BLM non-riot protests and riots as regressors, controlling for state and many background demographic factors (population density, household size, racial composition, etc.). The models (generalized additive models) that control most aggressively for background factors find small and positive associations between BLM protests and Democratic swing: counties with non-riot BLM protests swung more towards Joe Biden by 0.2 percentage points, and counties with BLM-associated riots swung more towards Joe Biden by (a statistically insignificant) 0.1 percentage points. The extra BLM-protest swing was not statistically significantly different in counties with relatively many Hispanic voting-age citizens, although it was weaker in counties with relatively many Asian voting-age citizens. Inasmuch as these results reflect causal impacts of BLM protests, the protests enhanced the Democratic swing but were probably not electorally decisive. My most elaborate model suggests that a lack of BLM protests in 2020 would have flipped only one state: Biden might have narrowly lost Arizona.",TRUE,FALSE,2020 election|black lives matter|electoral politics|presidency|presidential vote|protest|quantitative studies of protest|social movements|voting behaviour,2021-04-01T12:48:05.723816,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-01T12:47:33.261083,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ|https://github.com/kjhealy/us_elections_2020_csv|https://acleddata.com/special-projects/us-crisis-monitor/|https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php|https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=United%20States&amp;g=0100000US.050000&amp;y=2019&amp;d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&amp;tid=ACSDP5Y2019.DP02&amp;hidePreview=true|https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=United%20States&amp;g=0100000US.050000&amp;y=2019&amp;tid=ACSDP5Y2019.DP03&amp;hidePreview=true|https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=age&amp;g=0100000US.050000&amp;y=2019&amp;d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Subject%20Tables&amp;tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&amp;tp=true&amp;hidePreview=true|https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.2018.html|https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&amp;step=1&amp;isuri=1&amp;acrdn=6|https://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Downloads/RCMSCY10_DL2.asp|https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series|https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/s/MPVDatasetDownload.xlsx|https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/relationship-files.html#par_textimage_674173622,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/citation/,92qeg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6064d98c6f2ca100608f4a51/,6064d98c6f2ca100608f4a51,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92qeg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92qeg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92qeg,NA

The street, as a socially constructed space of discontent, had become the central locus of political change. In this paper, I will tackle the question of how and why policing strategies in Cairo failed to contain protesters, eventually leading to the withdrawal of security forces on January 28th. I will analyze the interactions between security forces and protesters in protest events during the uprising, focusing on policing strategies, tactical repertoires, and spaces of resistance. Through this, I hope to offer a way of looking at the politics of territorialization and space production in protest, and by extension, the negotiation of power relations between authority and resistance actors.",TRUE,FALSE,arab spring|arab uprisings|Cairo|Egypt|January 25|Mubarak|Police|policing|protest|security forces|social movement studies|sociology of space|space|spatiality|tactical repertoires|territorialization,2021-03-31T13:13:21.872587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-31T13:13:01.288768,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",Dimitris Soudias,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/citation/,y3k7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60645a0f2ad84a0035daaef1/,60645a0f2ad84a0035daaef1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3k7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y3k7g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y3k7g,https://doi.org/10.17192/meta.2015.4.2669

Using two waves of interviews with 77 mothers of young children, we examined why mothers—especially in dual-earner, different-gender couples—took on more pandemic parenting. We found that pre-pandemic gendered structures of paid work led many families to lean on mothers by default. First, within-couple gaps in job types, pay, and work hours led some mothers to do more childcare to protect partners’ work as primary earners. Second, educational gaps within couples led some mothers to do more as the only parent able to work fully remote. Third, pre-pandemic childcare gaps within couples led children (and partners) to rely more heavily on mothers, even when both partners were home full-time. We discuss the implications for research on gender inequalities in paid work and parenting and for policy efforts to address gender inequalities at home.",TRUE,FALSE,covid|employment|family|gender|interviews|motherhood|parenting|qualitative data|telecommuting,2021-03-31T13:12:42.763391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-31T13:12:22.629253,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/citation/,hgnfs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6063cf4f0ffef1000e6f8d55/,6063cf4f0ffef1000e6f8d55,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgnfs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hgnfs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hgnfs,NA

This heightened sense of vulnerability is associated with women’s perceptions of control over victimisation. Yet, the specific features of neighbourhoods that foster perceptions of control are not well understood. Drawing upon administrative data and a survey of 80 neighbourhoods and 2,862 participants in Victoria, Australia, we test whether gendered neighbourhood-level inequalities or broader neighbourhood characteristics are associated with lower perceived control over victimisation for women. Results indicate that gendered neighbourhood inequalities are less important for women’s perceptions of control compared to men. However, women’s perceptions of control are lower than men’s in neighbourhoods with lower collective efficacy and higher disadvantage.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-31T13:12:01.340435,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-31T13:11:27.525889,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Chloe Keel|Rebecca Wickes|Murray Lee|Jonathan Jackson and Kathryn Benier,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/citation/,8nrgc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6063ca7b6f2ca1000d8ed61c/,6063ca7b6f2ca1000d8ed61c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nrgc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8nrgc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8nrgc,NA
