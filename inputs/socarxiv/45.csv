We suggest a way of providing incentives to originators that is easy to implement. This is possible if there is an additional market in which the originator operates, where copying is not easily possible. Taking the music industry as example, copyrights in the records market could be replaced by subsidies or tax breaks in the market for live performances.

One controversial theory contends that having multiple non-marital sex partners reduces traditional incentives for men to get married and simultaneously undermines their prospects in the marriage market. For women, multiple partners purportedly reduces their desirability as spouses by evoking a gendered double-standard about promiscuity. Though previous studies have shown that having multiple premarital sex partners is negatively associated with marital quality and stability, to date no research has examined whether having multiple non-marital sex partners affects marriage rates. Data from four waves of the National Survey of Family Growth reveal American women who report more sex partners are less likely to get married (though so too are virgins). Yet this finding is potentially misleading given the retrospective and cross-sectional nature of the data. Seventeen waves of prospective data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth’s 1997 mixed-gender cohort that extend through 2015 show that more non-marital sex partners has a temporary effect on marriage rates: recent sex partners reduce the odds of marriage, but the lifetime number of non-marital sex partners does not. Seemingly unrelated bivariate probit models suggest that the short-term effect is likely causal. Our findings ultimately cast doubt on recent scholarship that has implicated the ready availability of casual sex in the retreat from marriage. Rather, the effect of multiple sex partners on marriage rates is “seasonal” for most Americans.",TRUE,FALSE,longitudinal data|marriage|marriage rates|premarital sex|sex,2021-01-04T17:10:45.821495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-04T16:31:51.377956,FALSE,NA,no,Publicly available data from National Survey of Family Growth &amp; National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort.,,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/citation/,n9e6p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff267621e6d9704212ffefc/,5ff267621e6d9704212ffefc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9e6p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n9e6p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n9e6p,NA

University Course Enrollment Networks before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In normal times, the network ties that connect students on a college campus are an asset; during a pandemic, they can become a liability. Using pre-pandemic data from Cornell University, Weeden and Cornwell showed how co-enrollment in classes creates a “small world” network with high clustering, short path lengths, and multiple independent pathways connecting students. In this paper, we show how the structure of the enrollment network changed as Cornell, like many American colleges and universities, shifted to a hybrid instructional model with some courses online and others in person. Under this model, about half of students are disconnected from the in-person co-enrollment network. In this network, paths lengthened, the share of student pairs connected by three or fewer degrees of separation declined, and clustering increased, with a greater share of ties occurring between students in the same field. The small world became both less connected and more fragmented.  (Corrected page proofs.

A moral conservative Russian grassroots mobilization is traced from its origins as a crusade against sexual education in the late 1990s, to a campaign against reforms of the state child protection system initiated in the mid-2000s. In this time span, understandings of ‘liberalism’ as chaos and elimination of boundaries have been superseded by an image of liberalism as totalitarianism, a conception resembling academic criticism of neoliberal governmentality despite the movement’s rejection of the purportedly ‘liberal’ Academy. The principal rejection of ‘liberalism’ is in practice mitigated also by ideals of communitarianism and civic engagement bearing many similarities to Western notions of ‘civic liberalism’.",TRUE,FALSE,children's rights|conservatism|family policy|nationalism|neoliberalism|populism|Russia|social movements|social policy,2021-01-03T22:48:20.961961,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-03T22:47:56.226918,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/citation/,ncm24,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff1f6441e6d9703f530480b/,5ff1f6441e6d9703f530480b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncm24/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncm24/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ncm24,https://doi.org/10.1080/04353684.2020.1780790

Sixty semi-structured interviews with WeChat users, China’s most popular social media platform, show that the app’s technical designs facilitated a set of online etiquette rules which reproduced those of acquaintance communities. Three dimensions of social etiquette rules were considered and observed: respect, elegance, and tidiness. Users honored the face of others and avoided causing others to lose face, often presented a positive but restrained self-image, and strived to preserve the tidiness of the online public space by avoiding the sharing of and exposing others to “negative energy”.A video abstract is available at https://youtu.be/2tG40y8J11E.",TRUE,FALSE,online interaction|social media|technical affordances,2021-01-03T22:46:40.901634,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-03T22:46:15.929732,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",TIAN XIAOLI,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/citation/,rhwm3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff1bce81e6d9703eb2fa1ae/,5ff1bce81e6d9703eb2fa1ae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhwm3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rhwm3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rhwm3,NA

In the Bangkok Declaration of 2019, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) vowed to significantly reduce marine litter. Efforts to reduce unnecessary plastic consumption have been seen in social movements, corporate policies and most noticeably, in regulatory control in the form of bans for specific types of single-use plastic items. A paradox exists as, arguably, civilization cannot sustain its current developmental momentum without the use of plastics, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic demanding higher levels of hygiene. This is the argument that is seen coupled with mass bans of single-use plastics, including packaging material and personal protective equipment. Corporate engagement to manage the plastic value chain in ways that commit to the creation of circular economies is attaining popularity. While reduction and substitution are being considered, the status quo of the scale of the production of plastics is still expected for the next few years as life cycle assessments (LCA), test trials of consumer acceptance towards novel delivery mechanisms and other forms of innovation are emerging. The reduction of plastics in the private-sector is allegedly ongoing but intangible in Southeast Asia. While recovery and collection innovations are underway for application and picking up speed, an unfathomable rate of marine litter entering waterways is still aggravating the bigger-than-ever problem of plastic marine debris in Southeast Asia. 
Responsible production has long adopted the concept of credits. Carbon credits are the most notable one, while palm oil credits are also prominently purchased by manufacturers to offset any palm oil content that is not yet sourced from certified sustainable suppliers. The concept of credits for plastics has been proposed but remains much less explored than their counterparts for other commodities. “Plastic neutrality” in the form of credit purchasing by manufacturers could likely be the final missing piece of the puzzle picturing a circular economy. In theory, the credit system could serve as an offsetting mechanism to recover from nature an equivalent or higher amount of plastics to be produced by the credit-purchasing responsible manufacturer. This paper explores how plastic neutrality through Plastic Credits, similar to the existing carbon and sustainable palm oil credits, could be applied in Southeast Asia.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-03T22:45:02.095060,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-03T22:44:41.812137,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Maggie Ka Ka Lee,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/citation/,jqfbm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff165131e6d9703cb2fcf45/,5ff165131e6d9703cb2fcf45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqfbm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jqfbm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jqfbm,NA

However the same is not reflected in the upper levels of governance namely state legislature and parliamentary elections despite Kerala being praised as a forerunner of women empowerment in India. The current state legislature has a mere 8 female members out of 141, which was almost the same since the first assembly which had 7 women members. Not to mention the state also send only one member to the Parliament, a numerical trend which has been consistent since 1950.
