A total of 542 employees in various occupations completed online and offline surveys, including measures on sexist attitudes, job satisfaction, stress in general, and demographic background. Results indicated that gender discrimination is evident among Vietnamese working men and women and it significantly predicts their job satisfaction and mental health outcomes. Theoretical and practice implications of the findings were discussed.

We theorize and show empirically how concurrency affects electoral outcomes. First, concurrency increases turnout and thereby the participation of peripheral voters. Second, in combined elections, one electoral arena affects the other. In our case of majoritarian executive elections concurrent to proportional representation (PR) legislative elections, the centripetal tendency of majoritarian elections colors off to the concurrent PR race. Third, concurrency also entails spillovers of the incumbency advantage of executive officeholders to the concurrent legislative race. Drawing on quasi-random variation in local election timing in Germany, we show that concurrency increases turnout as well as council votes for the incumbent mayor’s party and centrist parties more generally, with slightly more pronounced gains for the political left. As a consequence, concurrent elections consolidate party systems and political power by leading to less fragmented municipal councils and more unified local governments.",TRUE,FALSE,coattails|concurrent elections|electoral system|natural experiment|participation|turnout|voting behavior,2019-04-12T14:20:06.670997,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-12T14:19:28.287924,NA,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XFUJOO,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Lukas Rudolph; Arndt Leininger,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/citation/,3p5tf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb074ccf2be3c0018ffc56a/,5cb074ccf2be3c0018ffc56a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3p5tf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3p5tf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3p5tf,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102264

The reason why writing can be hard to learn is that writers face many challenges the moment they start writing. The challenges could be from gathering the ideas to be written, planning of the outline, focusing on sentence structure, choosing the appropriate expressions, and also making sure of the organization. Moreover, these challenges can cause students to have negative attitudes towards writing. Previous studies suggest that using writing strategies can help student control the writing process which have a positive effect on their writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing. The strategy of mind mapping is used as a pre-writing strategy to help writers visualize the structure of their writing. However, the researcher proposes using mind mapping strategy not only to organize ideas, but also to organize grammatical and linguistic knowledge. This study investigates the effect of using this mind mapping strategy as a pre-writing strategy to enhance female language learners’ writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing in English at Taif University, Saudi Arabia. In a quasi-experimental design, a mixed methods approach was adopted by collecting quantitative and qualitative data. The study population is 128 students in an experimental group (n1= 57) and a control group (n2=71). The former received the treatment of instruction using mind mapping strategy and the latter received traditional instruction. The objectives of this study are first, to identify any differences between the mean scores of the experimental group and the control group on post-tests of writing attitudes and writing achievement; second, to identify differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of writing attitudes and writing achievement for the experimental group; third, to explore students' views concerning difficulties to write in English. fourth, to identify the strategies they used to overcome these difficulties; fifth, to investigate if students thought that mind mapping helped them write better and, if so, how. The researcher prepared a test to measure the writing achievement of female first-year EFL students, and a questionnaire by Sturm (1996) to measure writing attitudes. An interview was conducted with a focus group from the experimental group to achieve the third, fourth and fifth objectives. Independent samples and paired sample t-tests were performed to quantitively analyze data from the writing achievement test and the writing attitudes questionnaire. Data collected from the interview were qualitatively analyzed. The finding of the current study are first, there exists differences between the mean scores of the experimental and the control group on the post-tests of the students` writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of the experimental group; second there exists significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group’s pre- and post-tests in writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of the post-test; third, students’ difficulties to write in English include lack of vocabulary, organization, spelling and grammar; fourth, students are accustomed to memorizing, practicing, and self-correcting, which indicates they are not used to planning their writing; finally, students also positively perceived the strategy of mind mapping and thought it helped them to better write in English.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|EFL|freshman students|mind mapping|writing achievement,2019-07-19T19:18:23.440541,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:17:53.445629,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/citation/,r4ybf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cafaf3039926900190cfde9/,5cafaf3039926900190cfde9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r4ybf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r4ybf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.232

However, in Saudi Arabia, students have difficulties learning English, especially those taught with traditional teacher-centered methods. In contrast, in the constructivist and cooperative learning methods, textbooks and teachers are no longer the only sources of information; their primary task is facilitating interaction among students and connecting students’ prior knowledge with new information. The present study investigates the effects of using the 5Es teaching model on EFL female students’ motivation and achievement at Taif University. Likewise, it may contribute to the literature on the 5Es model with EFL students’ motivation and achievement. The sample included 119 female Saudi undergraduate students studying English as a foreign language (EFL) at the first level at Taif University, in Saudi Arabia.  They study English language with a focus on reading, writing, listening and speaking, for 6 hours weekly over one academic semester. The sample was divided into a control group (n = 61) and an experimental group (n = 58). Two research questions were addressed to examine whether: (1) there are significant differences between the experimental group scores and the control group scores on post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement and (2) there are significant differences between the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’ motivation and their achievement for the experimental group. The researcher designed a program incorporating the 5Es model of teaching and learning which was used with the experimental group for ten weeks in 20 sessions. The 5Es model program provides the basis for learners to construct an accurate understanding of a new concept based on existing knowledge. In contrast, the researcher used traditional instruction with the control group for the same period. Besides the 5Es program, the two groups were asked to answer questions on a 5-point Likert-scale motivation questionnaire before and after the instruction to compare changes on students’ motivation.  The following statistics calculations were performed: t-test, mean, SD, and Pearson coefficient correlations to analyze the data. The results showed that there are significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental and control groups on the post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement in favor of the experimental group. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found in the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’ motivation and their achievement for the experimental group, in favor of post-test.",TRUE,FALSE,5Es model|achievement|EFL female Saudi students|motivation|training program,2019-07-19T19:11:42.375119,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:11:15.369498,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/citation/,3cbek,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cafae4aa3bc970019eda394/,5cafae4aa3bc970019eda394,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3cbek/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3cbek,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.231

The study principally aimed to highlight the strategies used by the translator to overcome the problem of no equivalence in the target language. Baker's strategies for translating idioms (1992) formed the basis of the theoretical part of the study. The analytical part comprised Agatha Christie's novel, Appointment with Death (2001) and the translation of the novel by Ameen from English into Arabic. The study concentrated on the most dominant translation solutions when translating idioms from English into Arabic. A lack of equivalent idioms in the Arabic language was one of the outcomes of this study.

Specifically, I hypothesize that individual income increases with hierarchical power, as does the share of individual income earned from capitalist sources. I test this idea using evidence from US CEOs, as well as a numerical model that extrapolates the CEO data. The results indicate that income tends to increase with hierarchical power, as does the capitalist composition of income.

exploiting quasi-random placement of asylum seekers in municipalities. Drawing
on entropy balancing for causal identification, we find clear evidence of increased
hostility towards asylum seekers in areas that housed them. This may be because
respondents only report superficial contact with asylum seekers. Moreover, general
attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants became less favorable in contexts with
local asylum seeker presence, while vote intention for the main anti-immigration
party increased. These findings go beyond existing work by focusing on citizen attitudes and voting behaviour and by examining contact directly as a mechanism. Our results show the need for designing policy interventions to minimise citizen backlash against rapid migration inflows.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum attitudes|backlash|contact theory|group threat|immigration attitudes|refugee crisis|voting behaviour,2019-04-11T19:57:50.178510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T19:57:18.424988,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/citation/,2qgp7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caf560339926900170cd69c/,5caf560339926900170cd69c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qgp7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2qgp7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2qgp7,NA

transfers of educational advantages and disadvantages trough parental
wealth in Germany, where in contrast to the USA, education at any level is
largely free of tuitions costs. Based on the unique features of wealth and
following the logic of subjective expected utility theory, we propose and, as
one of the very first studies, empirically test two causal mechanisms
underlying the parental wealth-educational decisions relationship:
“disadvantage compensation” and “educational demotivation”. We apply a
multinomial logit model for discrete-time event history analysis, allowing
us to estimate the relative transition risk ratio of children with university
entrance qualification to make the transition from upper secondary school
to 1) higher education, 2) the labor market or vocational training or 3) to
not transition at all. The relative transition risk ratio is measured as a
function of the relative position of the parents in the distribution of net
wealth. Our analyses, based on data from the German Socio-Economic
Panel Study (SOEP), reveal that children with wealthy parents are more
likely to decide for higher education, even if they are faced with low
cognitive abilities (i.e., disadvantage compensation).",TRUE,FALSE,demotivation|intergenerational mobility|parental background|rational choice|SES|SOEP|wealth inequality,2019-04-11T17:10:30.174229,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T17:09:30.888207,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/citation/,c46za,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caedf8139926900180cc910/,5caedf8139926900180cc910,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c46za/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c46za/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c46za,NA
