Boundary work is scattered in programmatic manifestos, lectures, and speeches, and it can be found in historicism, philosophy, and not least in the natural sciences. Revealing how local boundary work brings about the Geisteswissenschaften as a stable and robust social entity, this essay tracks symbolic boundaries between the two cultures. The German case deviates from the usual two cultures narrative: Although a distinction between the two cultures is just as momentous, the boundary between them does not distinguish a literary from a scientific culture, but two scientific cultures. The analysis contributes to a historical sociology of the social sciences and humanities by highlighting the temporality, the situatedness and the relational character of boundary work.",TRUE,FALSE,Boundary Work|Geisteswissenschaften|History of Humanities|History of the Human Sciences|Humanities|Natural Sciences|Naturwissenschaften|Relational|Sociology of Science|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge|Two Cultures,2019-09-29T02:24:02.322750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29T02:22:21.778955,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/citation/,zv3mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8f1c57c43280001cc57001/,5d8f1c57c43280001cc57001,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zv3mf/,https://doi.org/10.1086/696300,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zv3mf

Berle for a More Democratic Financial System,"At the close of the 1930s, Adolf Berle – brain truster and co-author of The Modern Corporation and Private Property – developed a plan for a “modern financial tool-kit.” This paper recovers Berle’s program for financial reform. The discussion opens with an overview of Berle’s personal and intellectual history, the historical moment in which he developed these proposals, and a summary of alternative proposals circulating at the time. Berle’s own proposals are then presented. Notably, we find that Berle stresses the need for (quasi-)public banks, improved infrastructure finance, and loan guarantees for small business. Based on these proposals, we draw three lessons for efforts to democratize finance today. The first concerns the importance of critiquing misguided alternatives. Here we assert that proponents of democratized finance should push back against private equity’s encroachment on public infrastructure. The second lesson takes inspiration from Berle’ invocation of precedents for government action as justifications for further reform. Here we argue for a closer focus on the trillions in loans currently owned or guaranteed via federal credit programs. The third lesson takes inspiration from Berle’s articulation of core principles to guide reform. In that tradition, we offer a distillation of the overarching principles of Berle that might guide democratic financial reform today: fair allocation, local and global sustainability, and political accountability.",TRUE,FALSE,banking|credit|economics history|finance|infrastructure|political economy,2019-09-28T02:19:44.104885,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T21:06:40.015733,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/citation/,7e2fc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8e5c2fc43280001dc63798/,5d8e5c2fc43280001dc63798,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7e2fc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7e2fc

To understand news rhythms, scholars have primarily studied how the rituals and routines of news organizations align with the practices and expectations of audiences.  The rhythms of today’s networked press, though, are set not only by journalists and consumers, but also by largely invisible digital infrastructures: software, data, and technologies from outside newsrooms that are increasingly intertwined with journalistic work.  Here, we argue that the rhythms of the contemporary, networked press live in the materials, practices, and values of hybrid, time-setting sociotechnical systems, a new concept we call anticipatory news infrastructure.  We explicate this concept through a typology of sociotechnical dynamics, showing how the networked press is poised to sense events, structure journalistic work, predict and commodify traffic, architect audience relations, and categorize content.  We argue that these infrastructures anticipate possible public life, thus creating anticipation publics through their largely invisible power to shape expectations of journalists and audiences alike.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-28T01:31:43.775640,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T19:02:18.536638,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/citation/,2jtns,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8e483ed5512000195bf6de/,5d8e483ed5512000195bf6de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2jtns/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2jtns

I use a total of eight waves from two nationally representative surveys of American adults—the National Health Interview Survey (N=145,941) and the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (N=96,073)—alongside restricted-use data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (N≈15,870)—the first such study to ever collect information on student sexual orientation. Across datasets and birth cohorts, gay men display a pattern of strikingly high achievement: their rates of BA attainment are not only higher than straight men’s, they are also higher than straight women’s. Gay men’s academic success is observable already by ninth grade. Compared to straight boys in the same school, gay boys perform better on a range of attitudinal, behavioral, and achievement outcomes. Sensitivity analyses suggest that this pattern is unlikely to be explained by selective disclosure of a gay identity. By contrast, lesbian women’s BA attainment has declined across birth cohorts, such that lesbian women are now broadly disadvantaged compared to straight women.

We extend the literature by developing and testing a theoretical framework of the short-term impact of family policy institutions on attitude change over the life course. The analysis links the German Family Panel pair-fam (2008 to 2015) with administrative records on childcare provision at county-level and applies fixed-effects panel models. Our findings show that the childcare expansion has been associated with moderate changes towards less traditional gender ideologies only among mothers in West Germany and mostly so among mothers without a college degree. Surprisingly, in East Germany, we found tentative evidence of more traditional gender ideologies among mothers without a college degree as the childcare reform unfolded.

Assessment and recognition in academic recruitment,"How do academics become professors? This paper considers the making of ‘professor’ as a subject position through which academics are acknowledged in both organizational contexts and disciplinary fields. The paper examines social processes of recognition in 145 appointment procedures for professorships in the discipline of history at sixteen German universities between 1950 and 1985. Based on an analysis of over 1500 documents from archived appointment records, I investigate how academics are acknowledged as professorial in appointment procedures. The procedures invoked both (1) processes of judgement, in which worth and qualities are attributed to candidates, and (2) processes of legitimation, in which said judgements are stabilized and made acceptable. Using insights from the sociology of valuation and evaluation, this paper sheds light on the fundamental processes of recognition and valorization in academia. The findings contribute to the sociology of scientific knowledge and science and technology studies, which have concentrated on academic recognition in the realm of research, but paid less attention to such recognition in organizational contexts. Complementing this literature, the paper allows for a more general understanding of ‘professor’ as a focal academic subject position.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Careers|Evaluation|Judgement|Legitimation|Positioning|Professors|Recognition,2019-09-27T15:49:50.227903,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T15:49:04.751040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/citation/,7jf2a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8e2618c43280001ac475f4/,5d8e2618c43280001ac475f4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jf2a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jf2a/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312719880017,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jf2a

Insights from the Associative–Propositional Evaluation Model,"Most people have one or more favorite pieces of media entertainment (e.g., movies, TV shows, novels, video games), and some personal candidates for the worst of them ever. But how exactly are such evaluative judgments formed? What are the underlying psychological processes of media entertainment evaluations? And why do we sometimes feel that the heart and mind are in conflict about those evaluations? To cover the whole complexity of individual media entertainment ratings, we apply the associative–propositional evaluation (APE) model (Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006a, 2011) to the case of movie evaluation processes before, during and after exposure. After defining evaluation and introducing the APE model, we discuss its theoretical and methodological implications for movies and entertainment research. Moreover, we highlight similarities and differences concerning common related concepts (e.g., enjoyment).",TRUE,FALSE,associative–propositional evaluation model|entertainment|evaluative responses|information processing|movies,2019-09-27T14:27:02.408374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T14:26:36.908241,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,Frank M.

On the one hand, concerns have been raised about the decay of news quality and political culture due to the growing influence of entertainment media. On the other, researchers have highlighted the potential of entertainment in terms of audience interest, cognitive accessibility, and public outreach. A literature overview shows theoretical and empirical support for both sides of the controversy about the (dys-)functionality of entertainment in political communication. Therefore, in an attempt to reconcile the divergent findings, the chapter presents an extended dual-process model of entertainment effects on political information processing and engagement. This framework offers substantial extensions to existing dual-process models of entertainment by conceptualizing the effects of entertainment on different forms of political engagement that have not been incorporated so far.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-27T14:26:26.158697,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T14:25:54.199387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,Frank M.

However, the majority of initiatives for integrated computing education have focused on K-12 settings, as has most education research around computational thinking. At the postsecondary level, computing education remains largely siloed within specific programming courses and has not been well-integrated throughout the STEM curriculum. Current instructional approaches often leave students poorly prepared to transfer their computing knowledge to solve new real-world problems. Additionally, there is limited education research into how best to develop computational thinking among postsecondary students. In fact, education research into computational thinking remains undertheorized and is often definitional in nature.  Here, we integrate computational thinking with the educational psychology concept of adaptive expertise. Finally, we contextualize computational thinking within constructivist learning theories by introducing computational apprenticeship, an application of cognitive apprenticeship to computing.  Computational apprenticeship provides a research and practice model for supporting the development of computational adaptive expertise.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-28T02:54:24.648523,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-28T01:09:26.139775,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/citation/,jy328,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8d3103d5512000185a8556/,5d8d3103d5512000185a8556,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy328/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jy328/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jy328
