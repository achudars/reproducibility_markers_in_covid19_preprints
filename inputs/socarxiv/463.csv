Coresidence, Parental Support, and Wealth Outcomes in Canada","This paper examines the relationship between coresidence with adult children, wealth, and economic security using data from the 1999-2012 Canadian Survey of Financial Security (SFS). The results, obtained via propensity score matching and linear regression, show that coresidence with and parental support for adult children is negatively associated with non-home assets and positively associated with debt levels among Canadian households. Further analyses suggest that these relationships stem from differences in financial assets, retirement savings, student loan debt, and credit card balances.

This is a significant omission given that disability severely limits opportunities and contributes to cumulative disadvantage. We draw from feminist disability and intersectional theories to account for how disability intersects with gender, race, and education to produce economic insecurity. The findings from our analyses of 2015 American Community Survey data provide strong empirical support for hierarchies of disadvantage, where women and racial minority groups with disabilities and less education experience the highest poverty levels, report the lowest total income, and have a greater reliance on sources outside the labor market for economic security.

The Wealth Consequences of Raising Children","This study uses 1986-2012 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort data to investigate the relationship between raising children and net worth among younger baby boomer parents. I combine fixed effects and unconditional quantile regression models to estimate changes in net worth associated with having children in different age groups across the wealth distribution. This allows me to test whether standard economic models for savings and consumption over the life course hold for families at different wealth levels. My findings show that the wealth effects of children vary throughout the distribution. Among families at or below the median, children of all ages were associated with wealth declines, likely due to the costs of childrearing. However, at the 75th percentile and above, wealth increased with the presence of younger children but decreased once those children reached age 18. My results, therefore, provide evidence for a saving and investment model of childrearing among wealthier families, but not among families at or below median wealth levels.

A simultaneous discussion on the role of automation in unemployment complicates the political narrative; by one estimate, 47% of American jobs are at risk of computerization (Frey and Osborne, 2013). This study analyzes how occupational automation corresponds with racial and ethnic demographics within occupational groups from both a historical and contemporary perspective. I find that throughout American industrialization, non-White and immigrant workers shifted to low-wage, unskilled work because of the political and social limitations imposed upon these groups. In the context of today’s AI-driven automation, I find that White workers are more heavily affected by automatability than other racial groups. Conversely, however, I found that the proportion of White workers in an occupation is negatively correlated with an occupation’s automatability.

Methods:  Data is baseline data from an evaluation of Talking Parents, Healthy Teens, a multi-session worksite-based parenting program.  Participants are 569 parents of 6-10th grades who responded to an advertisement posted in their workplace, and their 6-10th grade children (n=683): 683 parent-child dyads.  Self-administered survey data were collected in Southern California from 2002-2004.  We compare parent and child responses to 68 items about their relationships and communication about sex, and computed polychoric correlation (PCC), an agreement measure that corrects for possible parent-child differences in response threshholds, across dyads and across items.  Factors associated with higher agreement were found through bivariate comparison of PCC; linear regression on intra-dyad PCC; and linear regression on raw bias.

Results:  After adjusting for possible parent-child differences in response threshholds, PCC for items were low, with median 0.34 (inter-quartile range (IQR) (0.22, 0.41)).  Agreement was higher for sexual discussion topics (median 0.41 (IQR (0.37, 0.46))) than other items (Wilcoxon p&lt;0.001); in general, agreement was higher for factual than emotionally negative or hypothetical items.  PCC for dyads was very high, with median 0.87 (IQR (0.84, 0.91)), but left-skewed (skewness = -3.1).  Factors associated with greater parent-child agreement include younger child age, better parenting skills, parent married or living as married, and parent recollection of good communication with their own parents.  Agreement was not associated with socioeconomic factors.
Conclusions:  Survey-response discordance appears not to be solely attributable to response bias.  Items about concrete events yield better agreement than hypothetical items.  Response discordance may be partially attributable to different parent and child perceptions of their relationship because less discordance is evidence among parents with good parenting skills or who recall good communication with their own parents.",TRUE,FALSE,agreement; polychoric correlation; sex education; adolescents; parents; parent-adolescent communication,2019-03-30T14:38:26.931871,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-30T14:38:11.880883,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/citation/,98kz4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9f37630a13d7001a8a1f6c/,5c9f37630a13d7001a8a1f6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/98kz4/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.11.080,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/98kz4

Three-quarters of rural households in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh now have LPG. Almost all of these households also have a stove that uses solid fuels, and among those owning both, almost three-quarters used solid fuels the day before the survey. Household economic status, relative costs of cooking fuels, gender inequality, and beliefs regarding the ease, food taste, and health impacts of cooking with solid fuels versus LPG are important contributors to high solid fuel use despite LPG ownership. Households that continue to use solid fuels continue to expose themselves and their neighbours to harmful air pollution.

Based on a comprehensive new database, I find that wealth-income ratios have fluctuated by large margins in the twentieth century. In emerging India of the twenty first century, wealth is steadily approaching the same disproportionate size (relative to national income) that was seen during sharp economic downturns in interwar colonial India. The long run 1939-2012 U shaped trajectories of wealth-income ratios are reasonably explained by a mid century asset price slowdown and the return of high land shares in national wealth. These results corroborate the secular increase of wealth-income ratios in most large economies since the 1980s. The manifestation of this phenomena appears to be independent of the stage of development.",TRUE,FALSE,Development|Economic growth|India|Land prices|Property ownership|Wealth-income ratios|Wealth inequality,2019-03-29T12:16:23.931498,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-29T12:16:01.431921,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Rishabh Kumar,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/citation/,sj6h2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/djymf/,djymf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9dc1d1246078001bfd2984/,5c9dc1d1246078001bfd2984,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sj6h2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sj6h2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sj6h2

Because of the disruption in the migration flows, the volatility of this time series we must approach the production of population estimates, projections and forecasts carefully. Given that population estimates have been difficult to produce for Puerto Rico before Hurricane Maria and even more challenging following this disaster, this paper proposes an application of the demographic balancing equation using administrative records to produce population estimates on a monthly basis for Puerto Rico. A combination of data from: (1) monthly counts for deaths and births obtained from the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics Systems, (2) passenger flow data produced by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and (3) baseline census counts. I employ this approach to produce monthly estimates of the population for Puerto Rico, and use 2010 Census counts to assess the accuracy of the model. According to the 2010 decennial census, the population of Puerto Rico was 3,725,789 people; by employing the demographic balancing equation approach, the population was estimated to be 3,669,676 people in April 1, 2010. Using this model, I find that after Hurricane Maria, the population of Puerto Rico reached less than 3 million persons in December 2017 (2.97 million). The total population went back to over 3.0 million by January 2018 with an estimated population of 3.02 million people on September 2018.",TRUE,FALSE,Applied Demography|Hurricane Maria|Mathematical Demography|Population Estimates|Puerto Rico,2019-03-28T23:53:22.347575,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-28T23:53:02.874001,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/citation/,n8vpe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9d1adf246078001afefe24/,5c9d1adf246078001afefe24,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8vpe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n8vpe/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n8vpe

We argue that the prediction of conflict severity needs to focus on the actors that are responsible for conducting armed violence. Hence, we predict the severity of conflict in government-rebel organization dyads. Our predictors focus especially on rebel organization characteristics, behavior, and the conflict networks actors are embedded in. Our statistical learning approach relies on random forests to predict the severity of conflict. We demonstrate that our model performs especially well distinguishing high levels of severity from very low levels.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|forecasting|networks|prediction|random forest|rebel organizations,2019-03-28T23:52:09.051636,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-28T23:51:48.907829,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/citation/,92y58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t3spx/,t3spx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9cb1ade0a7de001994b24f/,5c9cb1ade0a7de001994b24f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92y58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92y58/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92y58
