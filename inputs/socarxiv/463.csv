The book has a strong Foucauldian flavour, exploring the ways in which power relationships are produced in this context. Ammaturo crafts a smooth flow of ideas, arguments and sources that address in a comprehensive fashion how these intersections need to be unpacked, dissected and brought to daylight for everyone’s benefit. And she does so in an accessible and ambitious way, without ever becoming simplistic or obscure – no mean feat.

Ammaturo’s starting point is Europe as a continent defined as ‘an aspirational entity and symbolic space of belonging’ (p. 1, original italics). In this space, gender and sexual minorities (referred throughout the book as LGBTQI persons) arguably play a crucial role in the definition of ‘European identity’ and ‘European Citizenship’ and contribute to Europe having increasingly adopted a ‘symbolic position of catalyst for social change’ (p. 2) for these minorities. Both human rights and citizenship frameworks and discourses have contributed to these developments. Ammaturo is keen to explore the grey areas in these developments and unleash the potential for radical transformation of current constraints on the citizenship and rights of gender and sexual minorities. To do this, Ammaturo chooses the Council of Europe – and the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg Court) in particular – as the context in which a ‘European sexual and gendered citizenship’ can be tested and put to its limits. In doing this, Ammaturo offers particular attention to a specific group within the diverse gender and sexual minorities that exist: LGBTQI asylum seekers and refugees.

In this review essay, I will explore some of the book’s key arguments and touch on some differences of opinion. Perhaps, these differences are mostly the result of different disciplinary backgrounds: while Ammaturo is fundamentally an international relations and social sciences scholar – thus perhaps more concerned with broader policy and institutional mechanisms – I am fundamentally a lawyer – thus more inclined by training to concentrate on particular policymaking areas and require strong evidence to substantiate final conclusions. This review essay will thus reflect the challenges faced by all of us academics in the field of sociolegal studies and interdisciplinary research more generally.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum|citizenship|cjeu|echr|european court of human rights|european union|gender identity|human rights|lgbtqi|refugees|sexuality,2018-10-14T14:38:22.309545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:38:05.850312,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c35|Law|Sexuality and the Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/citation/,nr5fz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5bkjf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/relationships/node/,5bkjf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc3297a512c03001790a544/,5bc3297a512c03001790a544,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nr5fz/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0964663917748003,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nr5fz

Do Social Comparisons Play a Role?,"Two of the most prominent phenomena in the study of social determinants of health, the socio-economic gradient in health and the income inequality–health association, have both been suggested to be explainable by the mechanism of status comparisons. This, however, has rarely ever been tested in a direct fashion. In this article, we explicate and test this mechanism by assessing the role of social comparison orientation. Research has shown that individuals vary in their propensity to engage in social comparisons, and those with a higher propensity are also more likely to be affected by the outcomes of such comparisons. In our analysis, we check whether the tendency to compare one’s income to that of others can contribute to explaining socio-economic disparities in health. Using individual-level data (N = 18,356) from 23 European countries on self-rated overall health and psychological well-being, we show that a high-income comparison orientation neither moderates the negative effect of income inequality on health nor the health differences by relative income. Our findings cast doubt on the crucial role that researchers such as Wilkinson and Pickett (2010) have attributed to the mechanism of status differentiation as the link between social stratification and health outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,Health|Health disparities|Health inequalities|Income inequality|International comparison|Social comparison|Wellbeing,2018-10-14T14:35:21.805384,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:35:11.394235,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",The authors,2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/citation/,2wky8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/46xw3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/relationships/node/,46xw3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc1d58eac0110001a6c6f38/,5bc1d58eac0110001a6c6f38,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2wky8/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jct035,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2wky8

(AI) research and its deployment in various societal domains and contexts. In this context, media and
communications is one of the most prominent and contested fields. Bots, voice assistants, automated (fake)
news generation, content moderation and filtering – all of these are examples of how AI and machine
learning are transforming the dynamics and order of digital communication.
On 20 March 2018 the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society together with the non-
governmental organisation Access Now hosted the one-day expert workshop “The turn to AI in governing
communication online”. International experts from academia, politics, civil society and business gathered in
Berlin to discuss the complex socio-technical questions and issues concerning subjects such as artificial
intelligence technologies, machine learning systems, the extent of their deployment in content moderation
and the range of approaches to understanding the status and future impact of AI systems for governing
social communication on the internet.
This workshop report summarises and documents the authors’ main takeaways from the discussions. The
discussions, comments and questions raised and responses from experts also fed into the report. The report
has been distributed among workshop participants. It is intended to contribute current perspectives to the
discourse on AI and the governance of communication.",TRUE,FALSE,AI|artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|Content moderation|Content Moderation|machine learning|Machine Learning|platform governance|Platform Governance|social media|Social Media|society-in-the-loop,2018-10-14T14:31:01.456727,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:30:45.335975,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/citation/,vwpcz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/djyp6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/relationships/node/,djyp6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc09295366e5e0017ce0112/,5bc09295366e5e0017ce0112,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vwpcz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vwpcz

I argue that in the resolution of logics, the work of the staff is to organize the competing logics by using a third logic – one that they feel ambivalent about - to mitigate the dissonance of the market logic and the mission logic and to resolve tensions.",TRUE,FALSE,dissonance|green building|institutional logics|LEED|organizational process|standard setting|US Green Building Council,2018-10-12T09:47:25.306582,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-12T09:47:06.370822,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/citation/,6q8cn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tafnh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/relationships/node/,tafnh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbfd1cc32a16e001ca6cdb6/,5bbfd1cc32a16e001ca6cdb6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q8cn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6q8cn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6q8cn

As a nonprofit, social movement organization the USGBC seeks to create change in the marketplace by encouraging more sustainable building practices through a voluntary standards. As they have done so, their organizational processes have begun to draw from regulatory agencies and firms to accomplish this aim.  Through the use of multiple organizational processes and forms, the USGBC works with stakeholder groups to respond to change and dissonance in a way that is congruent with Stark’s (2009) theory on heterarchy.

Pundits have argued that this performance can be attributed to the effect of the new leadership of Matteo Salvini, who shifted the ideological location of the party (that now aims at being a national right-wing party), combined with the drop in preferences of Forza Italia, the ally/competitor in the right-wing ideological spectrum. This paper aims at providing new insights in the explanation of these electoral outcomes, by hypothesizing that geographical trajectories of diffusion of the party are correlated with the presence of geographically clustered post-fascist minorities present in the region since the First Republic age. By employing official figures at the municipality level, the paper analyses the relationship between the percentages of votes for the MSI (the most relevant post-fascist force during the First Republic) in 1976 and the Lega Nord in the 2006-2018 period. Consistent with our hypothesis, the post-fascist inheritance is significantly correlated with the local prevalence for the Lega Nord in 2018, after the change in the political discourse and leadership of the party. Empirical analyses provide evidence of our expectations, even when controlling for unemployment rate and percentage of immigrants.",TRUE,FALSE,electoral geography|Italian politics|Lega Nord|right-wing parties,2018-10-11T18:18:21.129448,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-11T18:18:04.725275,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/citation/,u2rq7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xcehu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/relationships/node/,xcehu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbf6cfc95e98a001978a087/,5bbf6cfc95e98a001978a087,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rq7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2rq7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2rq7
