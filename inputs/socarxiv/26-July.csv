Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) combine the impact of morbidity and mortality, allowing for comprehensive comparisons of the population health impact of diseases, injuries, and risk factors. The aim of this paper was to estimate the DALYs due to Covid-19 in Malta (March 2020-21) and investigate its impact in relation to other causes of disease and injury, at a population level. 

Methods
Mortality and weekly hospital admission reported data were used to calculate the DALYs, based on the European Burden of Disease Network consensus Covid-19 model. Covid-19 infection durations of 14 days was considered. Sensitivity analyses for different morbidity scenarios, including post-acute consequences were presented. Estimates were for March 2020-21.

Results
An estimated 70,421 people were infected (with and without symptoms) by Covid-19 in Malta (March 2020-21), out of which 1,636 required hospitalisation and 331 deaths, contributing to 5,478 DALYs. These DALYs positioned Covid-19 as the fourth leading cause of disease and injury in Malta. Mortality contributed to 95% of DALYs, while post-acute consequences contributed to 60% of morbidity. 

Conclusion
Covid-19 over a period of one year has impacted substantially the population health in Malta. Post-acute consequences are the leading morbidity factors that require urgent targeted action to ensure timely multidisciplinary care. It is recommended that DALY estimations in 2021 and beyond are calculated to assess the impact of vaccine roll-out and emergence of new variants on population health.",TRUE,FALSE,burden of disease|coronavirus|Covid-19|DALY|disability-adjusted life years|European burden of disease network|Malta|population health|YLD|YLL,2021-06-10T11:58:22.710069,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-10T11:58:01.375381,FALSE,NA,no,Data is available on Malta Ministry of Health website and social media,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/citation/,8gdrs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c19a1118f70b01a0a7bed2/,60c19a1118f70b01a0a7bed2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gdrs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8gdrs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8gdrs

Explicating the integrative model of mobile media use and need experiences (IM3UNE),"Using mobile media can be both detrimental and beneficial for well-being. Thus, explaining how and when they elicit such effects is of crucial importance. To explicate boundary conditions and processes for digital well-being, this article introduces the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences (IM³UNE). Instead of assuming mobile media to be pathogenic, the IM³UNE offers a salutogenic perspective—it focuses on how we can stay healthy when using mobile media ubiquitously in daily life. More specifically, the model assumes that both the satisfaction and the frustration of basic psychological needs are key underlying mechanisms linking demanding mobile media use to well-being. However, the impact of these mechanisms is contingent on how users perceive, appraise, act on, and make sense of mobile media demands according to their global orientation to life (i.e., their sense of coherence; SOC). Integrating prior work, we theoretically link mindfulness, self-control, and meaningfulness to SOC’s central facets, arguing that they represent crucial personal resources required to cope with mobile media demands. Thus, the IM³UNE offers an integrative framework, guiding further research towards a more nuanced, less technologically deterministic study of mobile media’s well-being effects.",TRUE,FALSE,"coping|meaningfulness|mindfulness|mobile media demands|need frustration|need satisfaction|self-control|sense of coherence|smartphone, social media, self-determination theory, salutogenesis|well-being",2021-06-10T10:15:21.885990,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-10T08:01:08.146728,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/citation/,e9h2s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rwutz/,rwutz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c0fe8218f70b00e7a762aa/,60c0fe8218f70b00e7a762aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9h2s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e9h2s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e9h2s

Until now, it seems that no one can stop the rapid progress of science. Recent history records science as a form of rational human thought with the results of various scientific disciplines and sub-disciplines. Accompanied by suitable methodological materials and buildings, it is well preserved in libraries or scientific institutions such as universities. The progress of science cannot be separated from every discovery that is useful for the advancement of human life.  
The book is perfect for a beginner who wants to study the philosophy of science and wants to know the basics of logic. Very helpful for someone who wants or will study philosophy of science. The content of the discussion that contains the history of philosophical thought to the history of methodology in modern science is beneficial for ordinary people who want to know how to develop science. By studying philosophy of science, we try to look again at a more radical and critical view of the history and development of this book. 
The book presents several philosophers in several periods and discusses the essays that have been written. This book contains seven chapters beginning with an introductory discussion of philosophy, several branches of science, the history of the development of philosophy, which has been packaged. In the following chapters, this book discusses the basics of logic, how to present the philosophy of science, to discuss the influence of philosophical thought on modernity.

Some book sources that tell the events of the commotion are not written systematically, specifically, and chronologically. The writing of this is expected to add insight and detailed historical sources, chronology, and sharp analysis of the history of Yogyakarta, especially the commotion incident. The writing of this book is intended for the general public, especially for the millennial generation. This can refer to an effort to provide knowledge and lessons about the great history that has occurred in the ""Keraton Ngayogyakarta"" environment. In addition, this is can improve understanding for observers of the history of the land of Java and especially for observers of the history of the palaces in Java. This book contains objective information, although the sources studied are subjective. This can be seen from the content and discussion in the book that deliberately presented the history of the establishment of the Yogyakarta Palace and the history of the perpetrators of the commotion, including Sultan Sepuh, Sunan Pakubuwono IV, Sultan Hamengku Buwono III, Pangeran Prangwedono, Pangeran Notokusumo, Chinese Chief Tan Jin. Sing, Daendels and Raffles. In addition, it also explains the history of places that were silent witnesses of commotion, such as Vrendeburg Fort, Baluwarti Fortress, North Square, and South Square. This book has received attention to be reviewed because it has several supporting reasons, including 1) it has new sources of knowledge that support historical learning, 2) contains a systematic and structured discussion according to the chronology that occurs, 3) is objective in providing a discussion of the content, and 4) this also has received recommendations from several prominent figures in the Yogyakarta palace, including Drs. H.GBPH. Yudaningrat, MM. who is the son of Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX and KRT. H.

Both simultaneously want to restore the position of political subjects who are considered dead at the intersection of philosophy and politics. The book entitled “Subjektivitas dalam Filsafat Politik Alain Badiou dan Slavoj Zizek”, this book simply discusses Badiou and Zizek's understanding of political subjects that are considered to have misguided capitalism. The book by R. Setiawan consists of three chapters written theoretically. The first chapter contains the background of Alain Badiou and Badiouian's theoretical framework. The second chapter discusses the background of Slavoj Zizek and Zizekian's theoretical framework. Finally, the third chapter discusses the future of the Badiousian and Zizekian subjects regarding the reincarnation of political subjects, St. Paul's militancy and radicalism, and the confrontation of Levinasian and Derridean ethics. The purpose of writing this book review, apart from being an assignment for the Philosophy of Science course, also aims to provide a reference on how Badiou and Zizek understand the theory of critical political subjects.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-11T09:21:22.843650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-11T08:34:42.192339,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/citation/,mtzdp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8xut5/,8xut5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c0aa62f3ce940080249b5a/,60c0aa62f3ce940080249b5a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtzdp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mtzdp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mtzdp
