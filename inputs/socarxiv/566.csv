Exposure to heterosexual practices and to cultural messages depicting women as physically weak and sexually vulnerable, and transwomen’s embodiment of hetero-femininity play a central role in increasing their fears.

Our quantitative genetic models confirm the status quo; not of sociology, but of behavior genetics.

Nature-based recreation provides substantial benefits for human wellbeing, including improving physical and mental health, but can also have severe ecological impacts. The recreational value of landscapes and natural areas is often used to generate support for public spending in conservation. However, we still don’t know whether nature-based recreationists place greater recreational value on natural areas that have high conservation value compared to other green spaces.
2.	Here, we determine which attributes of nature-based tourism destinations provide recreational services. We used pictures of wildlife posted on Flickr to quantify wildlife-watching activities in Scotland. We then determined the environmental variables key to attracting wildlife watchers to a destination, such as protected areas (PAs), the perceived naturalness, and the presence of different types of infrastructure.
3.	Infrastructure is the best predictor of intensity of wildlife watching activities in Scotland, while areas of high natural value are rarely used. PAs act as a weak attractor of wildlife watchers, with PAs designated to protect threatened habitats or species having low recreational value. In accessible and highly visited areas, higher biodiversity increases the intensity of wildlife watching activities.
4.	Synthesis and applications. Areas of high natural and conservation value and areas of high recreational value do not tend to overlap. Recreational ecosystem services are mainly provided by the wider countryside and highly transformed landscapes as opposed to wild ecosystems and PAs designated to protect environmental features of high conservation value. These results question the synergy between the goals of recreation and those of conservation and the use of recreation as a justification for economic investment in conservation. During wildlife watching activities most people experience an urbanised, highly transformed nature; it will be important to determine how this human-dominated nature can influence support for conservation of wild and remote areas.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:29:52.004315,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-18T14:47:35.763787,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/citation/,vze7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8tbrz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/relationships/node/,8tbrz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3791bc1e3f47000e883462/,5a3791bc1e3f47000e883462,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vze7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vze7y/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vze7y

Much of the problem lies with the new potential for constant social comparisons. Social media also adds a new layer of interaction that can occur anywhere, at any time, with anyone. This allows for a higher quantity of relationships, but strips the depth of these relationships. Does increased social media use affect quality of life? I hypothesize that the more social media sites a respondent is a member or regular user of, the more time he or she reports feeling depressed or lonely. I used a sample of 628 respondents as part of in-person interviews conducted by the 2016 General Social Survey. The results found that overall about 51 percent of the people claimed to feel depressed or lonely none of the time. Meaning that about half of respondents do feel depressed or lonely at least some of the time. The most statistically significant finding revealed that the higher ones income, the less one reports feeling depressed or lonely. However, the hypothesis must be rejected because there is no statistical significance between social media usage and quality of life. Social media site usage does not result in increased feelings of depression or loneliness. Based on the income results, does money buy happiness? Those of lower socio-economic class may not have access to proper medical care and therefore do not get adequate treatment for mental illnesses.

The sexual violence perpetrated against women had been brutal, and it had resulted in physical and social destruction and psychological trauma. Nottage’s choice to set Ruined in the Democratic Republic of Congo was guided by the severe attitude towards women during the civil war, portraying the female characters as the victims of the war. The study is a brief description of women's situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, it concerns of how the female playwright Lynn Nottage depicts Congolese women’s social struggles, psychological traumas, and physical destruction. The research also discusses the motives and the purposes of writing about a sensitive subject as the violence against women. Consequently, it applies a feminist reading of the text, and it is supported by numerous academic journals, books, articles, and reports from international organizations. It concludes that Lynn Nottage succeeded in presenting the violence against women on stage.",TRUE,FALSE,physical-social destruction|psychological trauma|rape|sexual harassment|violence|women,2018-07-02T11:29:51.782108,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-18T14:43:48.979056,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/citation/,7wrqe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ts5dp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/relationships/node/,ts5dp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a37367b1e3f47000d88b186/,5a37367b1e3f47000d88b186,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wrqe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7wrqe/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.195,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7wrqe

This study analyzes the relationships between time spent consuming television and Internet, where a respondent gets their news from (television vs. Internet), and confidence in these institutions.  I predict an inverse relationship between exposure to television and Internet and confidence in media and government.  I further hypothesize that people who get their news primarily from the Internet have less confidence in these institutions than those who get their news from television.  I test this relationship using a sample of 370 respondents from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) dataset, controlling for race, gender, political views, education, respondents' family income at the age of 16, and age.  OLS regression analysis shows that more hours spent watching television positively impacts confidence in media, and that those who get their news from the Internet have less confidence in the media, as do conservatives, regardless of media consumption.  No independent variables determine confidence in government, which is only associated negatively with being conservative.  A second regression model using confidence in press instead of media shows that females are significantly less likely to trust the press and that people of color are significantly more likely to trust the press.  The relationships from the first model retained their significance.  This model shows a higher significance level for the conservative relationship.  These differences are discussed along with recommendations for further research.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:29:51.119284,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-17T15:12:08.119526,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/citation/,c4ur3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/62tnc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/relationships/node/,62tnc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a362644bd7829001066e618/,5a362644bd7829001066e618,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4ur3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c4ur3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c4ur3
