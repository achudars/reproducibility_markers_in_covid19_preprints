A landscape of words as opposed to a landscape of code (Thrift &amp; French, 2002), language-as-data becomes material in ways very different from both print and spoken word; its physicality represented in bits, bytes and circuitry, and its limits and variations mediated and governed by the processes which order, sort, move and index it. By virtue of their reproducibility and enhanced means of dissemination, digitised words can have paratextual – and often political – agencies and excesses beyond their linguistic function. Using examples of online search, dictionaries and translation, the paper will imagine how context as a kind of space might be produced, constructed and limited, how competing actors contribute tactically (de Certeau, 1984) to the (in)visibility and (im)mobility of the linguistic data in the searchable database, and how these actors negotiate the conflicting interests of money, efficiency and truth (Lyotard, 1984) in the geo-linguistic spaces of the web. With a geography of (con)text thus imagined, the mathematical and binary logics that construct and mediate the language within it are also clearly exposed. The paper goes on to discuss how creativity and originality might be restricted by ongoing processes of quantification and monetisation of language, before concluding that digitised language falls somewhere in the middle of a structuralist/post-structuralist critique; being at the same time both free from and constrained by the geographies of context.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithm|critical theory|digital geography|geographical software studies|google|language|search engines,2018-07-02T11:55:46.096865,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-09T17:41:15.846946,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography,Pip Thornton,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/citation/,q9kjw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sqw74/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/relationships/node/,sqw74,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1baea6b796ba000d3ff143/,5b1baea6b796ba000d3ff143,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q9kjw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q9kjw

Residential segregation studies in Indian cities have relied on ward-level data. We demonstrate in this paper that wards cannot approximate an urban neighborhood, and that they are heterogeneous. For a typical ward, the neighbourhood-ward dissimilarity index is greater than the ward-city dissimilarity index. Using 2011 enumeration block (EB) level census data for five major cities in India – Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai –  we show how patterns of caste-based urban residential segregation operate in contemporary India. We also present the first visual snapshot of caste-based residential segregation in an Indian city using georeferenced EB level data for Bengaluru. Besides implications for policy, our analysis also points to the need for publicly available, geospatially-linked neighborhood-scale census data that includes data on economic class for a spatial understanding of economic and social stratification within Indian cities.

This is due to a combination of historic and contemporary government policies, the agency of Indigenous people, and the constraints placed on residential location by the interaction of the housing and labour markets. This study traces the trajectory of Indigenous residential segregation in 60 Australian towns and cities, using census data from 1976 to 2016. Segregation is measured using the index of dissimilarity and the threshold method. Indigenous residential segregation has been declining steadily since 1976 nationally. However, there has been a great deal of variation in segregation trajectories among towns and cities.  In Sydney and Melbourne, segregation remained relatively high over the study period. The level of segregation in 1976 appears to be related to the geographical remoteness of the town, with remote towns generally having lower levels of segregation in 1976. Segregation has been decreasing most rapidly in regional towns in New South Wales and Queensland. Finally, this study has found a long-run increase in the proportion of Indigenous residents living in highly Indigenous neighbourhoods, consistent with the increasingly close settlement of Indigenous people in Australian towns and cities. This trend is at odds with the apparent decrease in segregation found when segregation is measured using the index of dissimilarity.

I describe my public work  2000 to 2009 on racial disparities in imprisonment which has included descriptive data analysis with graphical presentations, over 75 public presentations, and participation in multiple groups and commissions. My work does not fit neatly into any of the four boxes in Burowoy's 2x2 classification of types of sociology as professional, critical, policy, or public. I began the work ""as a person"" who became concerned about the issue, not ""as a sociologist."" In the first section I tell the story of how I got drawn into the issue by the efforts of community activists. I had critical concerns about the issue that brought different questions to the table than animated professional criminology,  but was not was concerned about criticizing sociology per se. In the second section, I stress that my special contribution was to bring professional skills in data analysis and presentation to the table in the service of a public purpose, and I argue that activist community often need these professional skills. In the third section I discuss the ways in which I have actively engaged with many different types of groups (grassroots activists, professional reformers, community groups) and talk about the ways in which these groups differ and, especially, the racial dynamics of different groups. I attempted to play a bridging role of bringing the discourses from one group (e.g. Black community members) into dialog with the discourses from other groups (e.g. police). In the fourth section, I critique Burowoy's distinction between public and policy sociology and talk about the real politics and racial dynamics of the different real groups I worked with. I stress that pointing to problems is much easier than figuring out how to solve them. In the conclusion I reflect on the ways in which my work may have had influence.",TRUE,FALSE,public sociology,2018-07-02T11:55:44.805825,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-11T16:09:51.408707,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology,Rowman and Littlefield,2009,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/citation/,cg6hp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7p6rk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/relationships/node/,7p6rk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1ae7e3b796ba00103f454e/,5b1ae7e3b796ba00103f454e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg6hp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cg6hp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cg6hp

This informal essay based on my experiences working with community groups around issues of racial disparities in criminal justice addresses three topics: (1) What kinds of knowledge are useful and how sociologists can contribute to producing useful knowledge. Here I emphasize that movements typically have a great need for information about the issue and less need for information about how to be an activist. I stress the value of professional skills for producing this knowledge and the problems in making knowledge accessible. (2) The general problem of class and expertise and the interplay of race and class hierarchies in creating knowledge within movements with special attention to the role of sociologists. In this section I stress the importance of listening to the knowledge people have about their own experiences and circumstances and bringing this knowledge into dialog with ""professional"" knowledge. I also discuss the real tensions and conflicts that arise in mixed-race and mixed-class groups. (3) The generic problem of opportunism and conflicts of interest and perspective and how sociologists fit into these problems. In developing these arguments I draw on longstanding discussions of tensions and conflicts between beneficiary constituents. I also advance the concept of an activist professional, a person whose activism is closely related to or intertwined with their job, and make the point that activist professionals often experience tensions and conflicts of interest between advancing the movement and advancing (or at least not jeopardizing) their careers. I discuss the ways in which Black activist professionals had a different standpoint from White activist professionals around the racial disparity issue because they saw themselves as part of the beneficiary group. I argue that academics in movements are typically conscience constituents and activist professionals and that academics who seek to work with and provide useful knowledge to movements should be aware of  these tensions and conflicts. I conclude by honoring the efforts and commitments of the people I have met in the movement and emphasize how much harder it is to find solutions to problems than to identify problems.",TRUE,FALSE,activism|activist professionals|public sociology,2018-07-02T11:55:44.360031,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-08T17:40:27.467265,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/citation/,km72c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6fmcb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/relationships/node/,6fmcb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1abcd1ec24e20010b616ac/,5b1abcd1ec24e20010b616ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km72c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/km72c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/km72c

Racism is a form of suggestion-induced sadism that authorities create by selectively dehumanizing people. Authorities can eradicate racist-sadism by invalidating dehumanizing suggestions. On many occasions, Jane Elliott has created and destroyed “eye pigment racism” purely through the power of suggestion. The US created skin pigment racism by establishing a white supremacist democracy. The US can destroy skin pigment racism by (1) removing dehumanizing white supremacist language from the US Constitution and (2) replacing it with a rehumanizing Declaration of Human Equality. On many occasions the US has generated nationwide support for bad ideas, such as unjust wars in Iraq and Vietnam.
