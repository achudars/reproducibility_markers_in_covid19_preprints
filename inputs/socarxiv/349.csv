A Comparison of White and Asian Americans’ Perception of Their Social Rank,"Asians are often viewed as the “model minority” group for assumptions about their high income and education level. Does this necessarily translate to higher self-esteem, social desirability, and self-perceived social rank for Asians? Building upon literature examining confidence, beauty, masculinity and the “model minority” stereotype, I use the General Social Survey (2016—2018) to study the relationships between attractiveness and perceived social rank for 124 Asian Americans and 3,038 White Americans. The attractiveness data was collected by the GSS rating respondents on their physical attractiveness. Social rank helps examine a general sense of perceived ranking in society that may not be explicitly expressed by socio-economic class. I propose that a high attractiveness rating positively affects the level of self-perceived ranking for Whites but not for Asians. I also control for sex, age, family income and education. The results of the regression support my hypothesis showing a statistically significant relationship between attractiveness and social rank for the White sample but not the Asian sample. However, the strongest predictor of self-perceived social rank was the level of family income. Therefore, the more money someone makes, the higher they self-reported their social rank for both Asians and Whites. Due to the limited sample size of Asians, further research including a larger group of Asian participants should be conducted to study the relationship between attractiveness and social rank.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian American|Race|Social Rank,2019-12-20T14:49:03.794488,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20T14:48:48.173141,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/citation/,6ajb5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfc09780236b8000c75b70d/,5dfc09780236b8000c75b70d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ajb5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ajb5

Past research shows benefits from spending time in green spaces, including improved well-being, as well as better mental and physical health (van den Berg et al. 2010; Atuoye et al. 2019; Bingley 2013). However, these studies focus on spending time in parks, gardens, or other natural environments and build their cases around the advantageous effects resulting from actual time spent in such places (Fan, Das, and Chen 2011; Litt et al. 2015; van den Berg et al. 2010). This study focuses instead on whether exposure to, regardless of time spent in green spaces, has similar effects. Using attention restoration theory and the theory of therapeutic landscapes, I hypothesize that the more one agrees that they have access to or views of natural environments, the fewer days of poor mental health they will have. This study uses data from the 2018 General Social Survey, with a restricted sample of only those who are employed or temporarily not working (N = 649). After controlling for race, family income, full-time employment status, size of place, and dwelling type, results show no significant relationship between access to or views of natural environments and days of poor mental health. However, multivariate results show that controlling for all other factors, white individuals had more days of poor mental health, and those who work full-time, live in single-family detached homes, or have higher family incomes had fewer days of poor mental health. While the results do not support the proposed hypotheses, the bivariate correlations begin to indicate which populations have access to green spaces, as well as which may be more likely to experience poor mental health based on demographic characteristics.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-20T14:54:02.331238,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20T14:53:53.182772,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/citation/,mpejg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfc049a0236b8000c75af89/,5dfc049a0236b8000c75af89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mpejg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mpejg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mpejg

It starts by asking: how do market prices work? Beyond mainstream economics, I find two distinct answers for this question: either prices are outcomes, coordinated by social structures through pricing scripts, or prices are performative-epistemological forces of marketization. Reviewing these two approaches to prices, I suggest they differ in their definitions of market knowledge, pricing, and price. I then examine these definitions by applying them to empirical examples of pricing in practice, drawn from ethnographic fieldwork in the Swedish meat industry. The conclusion presents a unified theory of market prices as a ‘structural episteme’: prices work recursively as instances of taken-for-granted knowledge about market-relevant social structures. Pricing, then, is the scripted marketization process in which this knowledge is performed through monetary quantification, thereby (re)producing said structures.",TRUE,FALSE,knowledge|markets|performativity|pricing|structure,2019-12-20T14:51:03.822326,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20T14:50:36.855426,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/citation/,qp5yr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfbd740fad251000a6a76b0/,5dfbd740fad251000a6a76b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp5yr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qp5yr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qp5yr

Launched in 2000 by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the GGP is a longitudinal comparative survey of 18-79 year olds in 20 countries in Europe and beyond, run by a consortium of research institutions. It is based on a relatively decentralized management model and relies on considerable post-hoc harmonization of data. The international “core” questionnaire is either adapted to the different national contexts or partly incorporated into existing surveys. Using data from the surveys administration, we examine the quality of compliance and standardization in the GGP and whether this affects data usage. Firstly, we analyze the extent to which instruments from the core questionnaire were fielded within each of the countries in the GGP. The results show that on average across countries, 66% of instruments in the core questionnaire were captured but this varies widely from 23% to 84%. Secondly, we take administrative data from the GGP website to capture the number of times each country dataset is downloaded, and we study whether those countries with greater compliance are more likely to be used in scientific analysis. We supplement this with the number of times a country dataset is used in peer reviewed comparative publications and cited in scientific articles.

Economic Downturns and Pentecostal Upsurge,"This paper estimates the effects of economic downturns on the expansion of Pentecostal Evangelicalism in Brazil. We find that regions more exposed to economic distress experienced a persistent rise both in Pentecostal affiliation and in the vote share of candidates connected to Pentecostal churches in national legislative elections. Once elected, these politicians carried out an agenda with greater emphasis on issues that are sensitive to fundamental religious principles. These results uncover a direct link between economic distress and a sustained entrenchment of more fundamentalist religious groups in a contemporary democracy.",TRUE,FALSE,economic distress|Pentecostalism|religious conversion|voting behavior,2019-12-19T20:15:01.778564,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-19T20:14:42.347808,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|Arts and Humanities|Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/citation/,9g5fv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfa618aa95d73000a395988/,5dfa618aa95d73000a395988,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9g5fv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9g5fv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9g5fv

Exploring the Economic Interface in European Port Cities,"In last three decades, planning agencies of most ports have institutionally evolved into a (semi-) independent port authority. The rationale behind this process is that port authorities are able to react more quickly to changing logistical and spatial preferences of maritime firms, hence increasing the competitiveness of ports. Although these dedicated port authorities have proven to be largely successful, new economic, social, and environmental challenges are quickly catching up on these port governance models, and particularly leads to (spatial) policy ‘conflicts’ between port and city. This chapter starts by assessing this conflict and argue that the conflict is partly a result of dominant—often also academic—spatial representations of the port city as two separate entities. To escape this divisive conception of contemporary port cities, this chapter presents a relational visualisation method that is able to analyse the economic interface between port and city. Based on our results, we reflect back on our proposition and argue that the core challenge today for researchers and policy makers is acknowledging the bias of port/city, being arguably a self-fulfilling prophecy. Hence, we turn the idea of (planning the) port/city conflicts into planning the port-city’s strengths and weaknesses.",TRUE,FALSE,Port-Cities; Relational Approach,2019-12-18T14:07:21.139260,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-18T14:07:12.911400,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/citation/,qtuyf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfa23f864e19d000d0fa35a/,5dfa23f864e19d000d0fa35a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qtuyf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qtuyf
