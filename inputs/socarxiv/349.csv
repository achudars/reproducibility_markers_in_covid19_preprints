Our paper makes a contribution to the sociological theorization of social media. It suggests that the dominant framing of social media in terms derived from communications scholarship, particularly the concept of the public sphere, proves unhelpful when trying to make sense of what people overwhelmingly use social media for in their everyday lives. The networked public sphere prism suggests that unbridled opinion exchange and political debate are what characterize social media and thus define our age. This has been part of the utopian investment in networked forms of communications, and has proven an important aspect in the context of recent protest mobilizations and movements for accountability in which social media played a highly publicized role. However, outside of such normative ideals and exceptional contexts, social media are rarely vehicles for opinion exchange or disruptive movements. Rather, from the perspective of everyday life, social media are more often aligned with order than with disruption, and with the display of status rather than reasoned debate. We propose drawing on the work of Norbert Elias to develop an alternate theorization of social media. Elias' early work on the court society, his analysis of the civilizing process, as well as the larger ""figurational"" approach to the study of human society he founded, are helpful not just in making sense of the status-seeking behavior of social media users, but also the new needs, desires, sensibilities and practices that emerge at the interface of social media and the spaces of everyday life. From Elias' work, we derive structural pressures as well as new sensibilities that emerge in social spaces ordered by an overarching system of rank. While the court-like sociality of social media tends to reinforce rather than challenge social order, this does not rule out that social media can become aligned with movements for social change. In these cases, however, activists have to actively work against pressures toward conformity, so their successes should be seen as exceptions, not as paradigmatic.",TRUE,FALSE,court society|figurational sociology|internet|Norbert Elias|public sphere|social media|social status,2019-07-11T17:15:02.858104,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-11T17:14:38.724156,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/citation/,phm5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d267904a26b3400160854de/,5d267904a26b3400160854de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/phm5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/phm5x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/phm5x,NA

Background: Much research explores the consequences of parenthood for women, but we know less about health outcomes and trajectories of men who become fathers. Theoretical approaches suggest both health-enhancing changes driven by social control and a new father identity, and health-decreasing changes driven by the costs and burdens of fatherhood.
Method: The NLSY97 longitudinal survey and a battery of novel fixed effects models are used to identify the consequences of paternity on diverse health outcomes, controlling for selectivity based on unobserved characteristics and unobserved trajectories of men who become fathers and accounting for heterogeneity of effects.
Results: Becoming a father induces weight gain and a decline in self-reported health, but reduces alcohol consumption. Effects on weight and alcohol use varied across strata defined by race and education, but changes in self-reported health were consistent across sub-groups.
Conclusion: The transition to fatherhood induces changes in health outcomes and behaviors that are both positive and negative. These consequences are not transitory. Rather, they persist over men’s early adulthood.
Implications: Fatherhood induces health-related changes that endure over the first years after becoming a father, and which may contribute to morbidity and mortality in late adulthood.",TRUE,FALSE,aging|fatherhood|fixed effects|health and illness|millennials|parents|transition to adulthood,2019-07-11T17:16:50.891856,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-11T17:16:15.262203,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/citation/,x4c7m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zvnme/,zvnme,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2645db45253a00193b69b1/,5d2645db45253a00193b69b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4c7m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4c7m,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12732

Yet the degree to which the affective meaning of a concept is encoded in the way linguistic representations of that concept are used in everyday symbolic exchange has yet to be demonstrated.

Two decades later such concerns had virtually disappeared. Rather than as a problem, IFDI were now portrayed as a solution - even symbols of national economic success. To better understand the ideational dynamics underlying this remarkable transformation in perceptions of IFDI, this research traces the evolution of economic discourses in the United Kingdom over the post-war period. Deviating from conventional accounts in constructivist IPE, the investigation indicates that the rise of first-generation neoliberal discourses in the 1980s played only a secondary role in these processes. Instead, the discursive reshaping of IFDI was primarily driven by the rise of the narrative of national competitiveness in the early 1990s – a discourse inspired by managerial rather than neoclassical economic theory. Building a framework that prioritizes (multinational) firms over national economies, the rise of this second-generation neoliberal narrative played a critical role in promoting now taken-for-granted imaginaries of the global economy as an economic ”race” between nations-as-platforms-of-production.

This study evaluates whether heterosexuals in Barbados are consistent or ambivalent in their attitudes toward anti-gay law reform and the extent to which competing messages from interpersonal contact and religion affect ambivalence. The analysis revealed that a majority of heterosexuals hold ambivalent attitudes about gay and lesbian rights. Moreover, results from a multinomial logistic regression imply that Barbadians whose views on sexuality were theologically based were less likely to support restrictions on same-sex intimacy when they have a close relationship with a gay man or lesbian. However, this decline in support for the laws brought about by meaningful contact did not translate to support for gay and lesbian rights among the religiously inclined. Rather, it manifested itself as a state of attitudinal ambivalence.",TRUE,FALSE,Ambivalence|Attitudes|Barbados|Caribbean|Contact|Gays|homosexuality|Lesbians|LGBT rights|Religion,2019-07-10T12:52:07.029677,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10T12:51:35.897998,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,Mahalia Jackman,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/citation/,528bt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d24a9a7114a420018023136/,5d24a9a7114a420018023136,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528bt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/528bt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/528bt,https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2019.1601434
