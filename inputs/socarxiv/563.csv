For the purpose of this study 56 senior Thai undergraduate students majoring in Business English at an International University in Thailand were selected and divided into experimental and control groups. Each group, consists of 26 students, both of them were given pretest to ensure the same proficiency level. Throughout the eight weeks in which the experiment was carried, the experimental group was taught through portfolio assessment technique and the control group was taught using the conventional method. Besides, an independent sample t-test was carried out to see the significant differences between the two groups. In order to see the differences within each group, a paired sample t-test was applied.

The researchers claim that mind mapping strategy has the potential to improve Jordanian students' writing performance. The study follows a quasi- experimental design in which an experimental group and a control group were purposefully chosen from eleventh grade students at Al Hashymiah School for Boys, Zarqa in Jordan during the second semester of the academic year 2016/2017. In the experimental group, 20 students were taught by mind mapping strategy and 20 students of control group were taught by the conventional teaching method as outlined in the Teacher’s Book. To collect the data, a pre-test and a post-test was utilized. ANCOVA was used to measure statistical differences in the mean scores of the participants of the study. The findings reveal statistically significant differences (at α≤0.05) between the two mean scores of experimental and control groups in the post- test in favor of experimental group. The study recommends an integration of the mind mapping strategy into the English as a foreign Language (EFL) curriculum in Jordan as it facilitates developing students' writing skill. The study also recommends  to examine the effect of using mind mapping strategy on EFL students' achievements in other language skills and sub skills.

Thus, the present paper responds to a main research question focuses on what the Algerian Manufacturing and Engineering Master’s students need English for. It aims at investigating the students’ language needs and identifying the stakeholders’ perceptions of the ESP course. For this purpose, this research is based on a case study design through which a target situation, a present situation, a learner factor and teaching content analyses were undertaken. In fact, this is done in order to help teachers and education leaders in Algeria to draw a clear policy to ensure successful implementation of ESP courses. Two questionnaires and two semi-structured interviews were addressed to Algerian Engineering Master’s students, English language teachers, subject-specialists and administrators. The results revealed that Engineering students were highly motivated to learn English. They also indicated that there is an absence of an adequate proficiency level of English from the part of the students as they are unable to practice effectively the four skills namely listening, speaking, and communication. This is why they need to learn English in order to write exam answer, read textbooks, course handouts, follow lectures, and listen to instructions and explanations.

Two research instruments, the survey questionnaire and the semi-structured interview, are employed for this study. The findings indicate overall positive perceptions towards native English speaking teachers, pointing that their classes are mostly fun, interactive and motivating. The flexible and interactive teaching methods and styles used by native English speaking teachers are found to be most favoured, followed by their approachable personality traits and the students’ vast opportunity to practice oral and written English.

The historical evolution of teacher leadership through various phases gives useful insights into how this concept has emerged, developed and perceived in different educational contexts and how it appears in today’s institutions around the world. The definitions of teacher leadership delineate various features of teachers’ roles, responsibilities and their expected contribution to organisational effectiveness while operating in a wide range of formal and informal leadership roles. Review of the literature also shows the significance of leadership knowledge and skills for the academic leadership positions that need to be fostered in a school context.  Moreover, it highlights factors that might hinder the emergence of teacher leadership in academic institutions.

The research design utilized multiple semi-structured, recorded interviews. The participants’ responses were grouped and analyzed through a reflection framework comprised by Hatton and Smith (1995), which discusses four types of reflections: technical, descriptive, dialogic, and critical. The findings revealed that most participants understood the concept of reflection in education similarly rather than differently. Second, the results showed that the most frequently produced single reflection type was descriptive, followed by technical, dialogic and critical. Overall, all 10 participants produced different single as well as hybrid reflection types, which was a rather important finding of this study as hybrid reflections have not yet been thoroughly explored in the research literature. The use of hybrid reflections also indicated that reflective thinking is not a linear process that can be easily categorized based on a certain reflection type. Third, the study describes a few characteristics of highly and less reflective participants.

This paper investigates the integration of local knowledge into English language learning by examining the cultural content of the Your Language My Culture supplementary reading module and teachers and students’ acceptance of the module. Using a conceptual framework that incorporated types of culture, cultural senses and representation of cultural information, data were collected using a questionnaire, reflective blogs and evaluation checklists from 57 teachers from various schools in the state of Terengganu in Malaysia. Content and thematic analysis were carried out and the findings show that while local, target and international culture were represented, the emphasis was towards local culture. Most of the cultural information was represented in the form of visual illustrations and less in dialogue and video recordings with the aesthetic sense dominating in terms of cultural sense. It is recommended that types of representations like dialogues, recordings, written tasks, visuals, texts and realia be included to help students attain pragmatic skills to use the language. A richer inclusion of the cultural senses in a balanced way can help students reach a holistic understanding of culture and recognize different perspectives embedded in the language.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural representations|cultural senses|language learning|local knowledge|types of culture,2018-07-02T11:31:09.291484,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:26:39.125746,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/citation/,3hn4c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jec4t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/relationships/node/,jec4t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45a2d3b794960012aff47c/,5a45a2d3b794960012aff47c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hn4c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3hn4c/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3hn4c

This study is unique in the sense that there has been hardly any systematic investigation that has considered the professional identity of Pakistani EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia. This study has two considerations: the way EFL teachers' selves evolve and the personal, professional, social and pedagogical factors constructing a teacher’s professional identity. This study was conducted at the English Language Institute of Saudi Arabian University and the study employed a quantitative survey method. The quantitative data was collected from 41 Pakistani EFL teachers by using an online questionnaire. The findings from the research revealed that a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors develop the professional identity of Pakistani EFL teachers. Among these factors are the participants' pre-Saudi Arabia lives and the decision to become EFL teachers, the decision to come to Saudi Arabia, the impact of their overseas EFL experience, and the social influence on their own professional identity. Moreover, other factors that develop these teachers' professional identities are:  being non-native, their views on continuing professional development (CPD), interaction with other EFL teachers, and their professional futures.",TRUE,FALSE,constructing teaching selves|NNEST|Pakistani EFL teachers|professional identity|Saudi EFL context,2018-07-02T11:31:09.122161,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:28:01.680861,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/citation/,npxh3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/csjxy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/relationships/node/,csjxy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45a102b794960013afc2cc/,5a45a102b794960013afc2cc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npxh3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npxh3

Special attention is given to the symbolic meaning of idiom components. Aspects of English phraseology are analyzed by emphasizing phraseological antonymy as an important linguistic universal that is pointed out as binary structures playing an important role in cognition by participating in cognitive and structural processes. The analysis considers explicit and implicit representation of the concept of ‘white’, its semiotic and symbolic meanings and its psychical effect on a human being. The article focuses on the process of phrase-forming as a language phenomenon and an efficient means of term-formation in the English language. The authors discusses possibility of using and reproducing idioms with the phraseological model adjective + noun and forecasts further term-formation according to the phraseological model. The article is aimed at showing interaction of linguistic and extra linguistic aspects within an idiom, as a linguistic unit, and the way the linguistic aspects transform into extra linguistic ones and vice versa.",TRUE,FALSE,English|idiom|semantics|semiotics|symbolic meaning|term-formation,2018-07-02T11:31:09.079208,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:28:32.380180,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/citation/,n2h3d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cewgp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/relationships/node/,cewgp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a459f5eb794960012aff39b/,5a459f5eb794960012aff39b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2h3d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n2h3d/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n2h3d
