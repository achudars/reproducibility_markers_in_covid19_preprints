In doing so, we can separate two sources of information: knowledge we have about the particular individual (individual knowledge) and knowledge we have about the social group to which that individual belongs (categorical knowledge). However, it is yet unclear how these two types of knowledge contribute to making predictions about other people’s choice behavior. To fill this gap, we had participants learn probabilistic preferences by predicting object choices of agents that either belonged to a social group (Group condition) or not (Individual condition). We quantified how close predictions for a specific agent are relative to the objective individual preferences of that agent and how close these predictions are relative to the objective group-level preferences to which that agent belongs. As expected, we found that participants’ predictions in the Group condition, relative to the Individual condition, were more similar to the group-level preference, while less similar to the individual-level preferences. We interpret this pattern of results as indicative of a differential weighting of individual and categorical group knowledge when making predictions about individuals that belong to a social group.

In this paper we provide the first public evaluation of the redistribution of taxing rights associated with the leading proposals of the OECD, IMF and the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT). The first key finding is that that reallocation of taxing rights towards “market jurisdictions”, as it is currently understood, is likely to be of little benefit to non-OECD countries. Indeed, the proposal is likely to reduce revenues for a range of lower-income countries. Second, all of the proposals deliver a much broader distribution of benefits if some element of taxing rights is apportioned according to the location of multinationals’ employment, and not only of sales.",TRUE,FALSE,tax; corporate tax; OECD; tax havens; tax avoidance; profit shifting; country-by-country reporting,2019-10-04T20:00:42.945038,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-04T20:00:33.519151,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,NA,Alex Cobham|Tommaso Faccio and Valpy FitzGerald,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/citation/,j3p48,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s6tx7/,s6tx7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d977bc37aae03000b51d055/,5d977bc37aae03000b51d055,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j3p48/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j3p48/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j3p48,NA

This new emerging literature has already provoked a considerable amount of controversy, involving debates on the precise underlying mechanisms, the role of non-familial institutions and the possibility of reversed causality, as well as the quality of historical data. Using novel historical database of European family this paper reaffirms the hypothesis that historical family organization could be one of the intermediate factors associated with developmental and value disparities among European nations today pointed out in earlier scholarship. We show that countries starting out from more patriarchal family structures in the past exhibit more hierarchical gender relations, more collectivist mindsets, and lower levels of economic and human development in the present. These findings suggest that the criticism of the family role in comparative development may be premature, and that links between historical family organisation and developmental gradients merit further attention.",TRUE,FALSE,comparative development|family systems|family ties|gender inequality|historical persistence|individualism/collectivism|patriarchy,2019-10-04T16:03:03.873351,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-04T16:02:39.998681,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/citation/,ad7qr,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d96e896055eda000d3c0b48/,5d96e896055eda000d3c0b48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ad7qr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ad7qr,NA

This has paralleled a greater push towards public engagement with science since the 1980s, with an emphasis on new forms of participation beyond scholarly audiences. Here, we take innovative dissemination to mean dissemination that goes beyond traditional venues for academic publishing in order to achieve more widespread research uptake and understanding.
In this paper, we present ten steps that researchers can take in order to embrace these practices in their research activities. We address key aspects and challenges of the currently transforming scientific landscape, and propose recommendations and solutions addressing the needs of a variety of key stakeholders, including researchers, innovators, the general public, and research funding bodies. The purpose of this paper is to provide advice to these groups in order to facilitate their dissemination activities with a greater knowledge of the methods, tools and services at their disposal.",TRUE,FALSE,Dissemination Plan|OpenUP|Public Engagement|Social media|Social Media,2019-10-03T14:18:01.264238,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-03T14:17:35.295662,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/citation/,s24uj,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w6hmk/,w6hmk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d95df3a2c88d6000d5c5979/,5d95df3a2c88d6000d5c5979,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s24uj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s24uj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s24uj,NA
