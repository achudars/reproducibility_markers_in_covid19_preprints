This paper contributes to this limited literature by using data for children in the 2015 American Housing Survey Metropolitan samples. Controlling for black-white inequalities in residential characteristics, segregation, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics, we find that the black-white disparity in pediatric asthma remains and slightly widens. We also find that the level of segregation, as measured by the index of dissimilarity and black isolation, moderates the association between children’s race and asthma. In areas with lower levels of dissimilarity and black isolation, whites’ predicted probabilities of asthma are greater than those of black children. However, when the index of dissimilarity is at least 60% and the black isolation is at least 50%, the racial disparity reverses, and black children’s predicted probabilities of asthma are significantly higher than those of whites.",TRUE,FALSE,asthma|metropolitan areas|Residential segregation,2020-03-21T00:48:01.593476,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-21T00:47:40.889859,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/citation/,dr3gb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e753b614a60a5058cbb554e/,5e753b614a60a5058cbb554e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3gb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dr3gb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dr3gb,NA

Characteristics of OA authors at Ph.D. granting institutions in the USA,"The open access (OA) publication movement aims to present research literature to the public at no cost and with no restrictions. While the democratization of access to scholarly literature is a primary focus of the movement, it remains unclear whether OA has uniformly democratized the corpus of freely available research, or whether authors who choose to publish in OA venues represent a particular subset of scholars - those with access to resources enabling them to afford article processing charges (APCs). We investigated the number of OA articles with article processing charges (APC OA) authored by 182,320 scholars with known demographic and institutional characteristics at American research universities across 11 broad fields of study. Results show, in general, that the likelihood for a scholar to author an APC OA article increases with male gender, employment at a prestigious institution (AAU member universities), association with a STEM discipline, greater federal research funding, and more advanced career stage (i.e., higher professorial rank).

In Section 2, we empirically analyse nationally representative survey data from the US about law-related attitudes and legal compliance. Consistent with prior studies, we find that people’s ascriptions of legitimacy to the legal system (labelled here ‘legitimacy’) are predicted strongly by their perceptions of the procedural justice and lawfulness of police and court officials’ action. Two factors emerge as significant predictors of people’s compliance with the law: (i) their belief that they have a (content-independent, moral) duty to obey the law (which is one element of legitimacy, as defined here); and (ii) their moral assessment of the content of specific legal requirements (referred to here as ‘perceived moral content of laws’). We also observe an interactive relationship between these two factors. At higher levels of perceived moral content of laws, felt duty to obey is a better predictor of compliance than it is at lower levels. And, similarly, perceived moral content of laws is a better predictor of compliance at higher levels of felt duty to obey. This suggests that the moral content incorporated in specific laws interacts with the normative force people ascribe to legal authorities by virtue of other qualities, specifically here procedural justice and lawfulness. In Section 3, the focus shifts to a philosophical analysis, whereby we identify a parallel (similarly interactive) modality in the way that form and content mutually affect the value of the rule of law. We advocate a distinctive alternative to two rival approaches in jurisprudential discourse, the first of which claims that Lon Fuller’s eight precepts of legality embody moral qualities not contingent on the law’s content, while the second denies any independent moral value in these eight precepts, viewing them as entirely subservient to the law’s substantive goals. In contrast, on the view put forward here, Fuller’s principles possess (inter alia) an expressive moral quality, but their expressive effect does not materialise in isolation from other, contextual factors. In particular, the extent to which it materialises is partly sensitive to the moral quality of law’s content.",TRUE,FALSE,compliance|lawfulness|legitimacy|procedural justice|rule of law,2020-03-20T15:49:06.750063,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-20T15:48:34.700152,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c62|Law|Jurisprudence,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/citation/,tqx62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7485d54a60a50532bb69a7/,5e7485d54a60a50532bb69a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqx62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqx62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqx62,NA

This scenario imposes two problems: (i) finding a compensation that makes the project acceptable for the pre-determined host, and (ii) securing the budget to pay for the project and the required compensation. We use a market-like mechanism with two useful properties for this scenario: players can either contribute or request subsidies to fund the public project, and players have veto power over the desired project quantity. In our game, two players benefit from a waste incinerator facility, whereas the third group member, the host, is harmed if the facility is too large. We analyze the efficiency and the re-distributive potential of this mechanism, with and without communication, among group members. We find that the probability of positive provision did not differ with and without communication. However, average provided quantities with respect to the efficient quantity increased from 54% to 81% with communication. We also find that contributions fell below the Lindahl taxes, allowing the players who benefit from a larger facility to accrue most of the efficiency gains.

For a variety of reasons, studies that produce null findings are especially likely to be unobserved, creating biases in publicly accessible research. While several approaches have been suggested to overcome this problem, none have yet proven adequate. We propose a new model in which scholars post short “null results reports” online that summarize their research designs, findings, and interpretations. We discuss a template for these reports and illustrate their utility with two experimental studies focused on the naturalization of immigrants in the United States and attitudes toward Syrian refugees in Jordan. We conclude with a discussion of how to overcome incentive problems and inculcate a discipline-wide norm of publicizing null findings.",TRUE,FALSE,Methods|Null effects|Null results,2020-03-20T10:26:31.647867,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-20T10:26:09.334517,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/citation/,5ebpy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e73f0504a60a50503bb7ed4/,5e73f0504a60a50503bb7ed4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ebpy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ebpy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ebpy,NA

In most low and middle-income countries, data on neonatal deaths come primarily from household surveys. We conducted a validation study of survey data on neonatal mortality in Guinea-Bissau (West Africa). We used records from an urban health and demographic surveillance
system (HDSS) that monitors child survival prospectively, as our reference dataset. We selected a stratified sample of 599 women aged 15-49 years old among residents of the
HDSS, and collected the birth histories of 422 participants. We cross-tabulated survey and HDSS data. We used a mathematical model to investigate biases in survey estimates of neonatal mortality. Reporting errors in survey data might lead to estimates of the neonatal mortality rate that are too high. This may limit our ability to track progress towards global health objectives.",TRUE,FALSE,Africa|Infant Mortality|measurement error|Neonatal Mortality|specificity/sensitivity|Stillbirths|survey data,2020-03-20T10:26:11.602739,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-20T10:25:41.182547,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/citation/,qx2kn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e73db334a60a504f8bb60e6/,5e73db334a60a504f8bb60e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qx2kn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qx2kn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qx2kn,NA

However, current indices primarily capture wealth in globalized market economies, thus ignoring other forms of prosperity, such as success in agricultural activities.  Using a simple extension to the standard estimation of the DHS Wealth Index, we describe procedures for estimating an Agricultural Wealth Index (AWI) that complements market-based wealth indices by capturing household success in agricultural activities.  We apply this procedure to household data from 129 DHS surveys from over 40 countries with sufficient land and livestock data to estimate a reliable and consistent AWI.  We assess the construct validity of the AWI using benchmarks of growth in both adults and children.  This alternative measure of wealth provides new opportunities for understanding the causes and consequences of wealth inequality, and how success along different dimensions of wealth creates different social opportunities and constraints for health and well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,Wealth and Poverty; Asset-based Wealth Indices; Growth and Nutrition; DHS Wealth Index,2020-03-20T10:25:54.616480,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-20T10:25:19.457783,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development,J.Hackman; D.Hruschka; M.Vizireanu,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/citation/,gqxby,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vhkgt/,vhkgt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e73d0c10cd06c0510004aa5/,5e73d0c10cd06c0510004aa5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gqxby/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gqxby/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gqxby,NA
