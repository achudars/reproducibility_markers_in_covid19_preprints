Based on observational data and in-depth interviews with 16 surgeons, 11 nurses, and 36 patients and their family members between February 2016 and July 2017, it reveals how both victims and perpetrators normalize instances of micro-inequities, often failing to recognize or acknowledge them. The findings illustrate how the prevalence of micro-inequities varies between different medical institutions, and suggest that while subtle in nature, their effect raises concerns regarding dignity and respect for patients and family members. Drawing on existing philosophical analyses of micro-inequities, the study concludes that their production in hospital settings creates an institutional ethos that disdains and marginalizes patients and their family members. Further, it negatively influences the patient/family-doctor relationship and functions as a barrier to reflective patient-centered care.",TRUE,FALSE,Constructivist grounded theory|Dignity|Doctor-patient relationship|Ethics|Health Inequities|Qualitative study|Respect,2018-09-01T14:38:24.242992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-01T14:38:07.863907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/citation/,y63xk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/82pfz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/relationships/node/,82pfz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8a38d46a59a500186dc784/,5b8a38d46a59a500186dc784,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y63xk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y63xk/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.05.036,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y63xk

In the Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s, writers like Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein dreamed of the robots and rocket ships that would preoccupy thousands of engineers a few decades later. In 1980s cyberpunk, Vernor Vinge, William Gibson, and Bruce Sterling imagined virtual worlds that informed generations of technology entrepreneurs. When Margaret Atwood was asked what draws her to dystopian visions of the future, she responded, ""I read the newspaper."" This is not just a reiteration of the truism that science fiction is always about the present as well as the future.

In this paper, I argue that the discourse of “the creep,” a stigmatized sexual figure, functions as a disciplinary mechanism that both creates and limits men’s desire and sense of self in the tense initiation of a sexual moment. My analysis of 244 articles from 3 popular men’s magazines suggests that an idealized sexual moment, as it is imagined in the pages of popular men’s magazines, is fraught with the risk of miscommunication and the potential for failure. The figure of the creep on the cusp of a sexual moment signals a tension in the masculine self that, if resolved successfully, produce a particular heterosexual masculinity and access to women’s bodies in an idealized sexual interaction. Furthermore, the discourse of the creep helps men manage these risks as they relate to feminist discourses about sexual harassment and violence.

But how does the expansion of police presence in poor urban communities affect educational outcomes? Previous research points at multiple mechanisms with opposing effects. This article presents the first causal evidence of the impact of aggressive policing on minority youths’ educational performance. Under Operation Impact, the New York Police Department (NYPD) saturated high-crime areas with additional police officers with the mission to engage in aggressive, order-maintenance policing. To estimate the effect of this policing program, we use administrative data from more than 250,000 adolescents age 9 to 15 and a difference-in-differences approach based on variation in the timing of police surges across neighborhoods. We find that exposure to police surges significantly reduced test scores for African American boys, consistent with their greater exposure to policing. The size of the effect increases with age, but there is no discernible effect for African American girls and Hispanic students. Aggressive policing can thus lower educational performance for some minority groups. These findings provide evidence that the consequences of policing extend into key domains of social life, with implications for the educational trajectories of minority youth and social inequality more broadly.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Inequality|Policing|Race,2018-08-29T20:42:25.519259,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-29T20:41:41.831131,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/citation/,rdchf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5mzue/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/relationships/node/,5mzue,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b86eeeeb57ff50016ec9413/,5b86eeeeb57ff50016ec9413,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rdchf/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122419826020,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rdchf

Based on life tables, these forecasts entail strong assumptions that current marriages will behave in the future like others did in the past.  I use data from the 1995 June Marriage and Fertility Supplement of the Current Population Survey to test an alternative method of forecasting divorce rates: predictions based on the parametric sickle model of marital instability.  The sickle model corresponds almost perfectly to completed marriage cohorts (30 year marriages unlikely to ever dissolve), but offered implausibly low divorce rate forecasts for newer marriages. It is therefore unlikely to be useful for forecasting divorce rates.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|divorce|divorce rate|sickle model,2018-08-29T20:42:06.162101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-29T20:41:23.047749,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/citation/,txqsm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/45ube/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/relationships/node/,45ube,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b86ed25b57ff50018ec8bb0/,5b86ed25b57ff50018ec8bb0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/txqsm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/txqsm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/txqsm

perception of society's support for the Sexual Double Standard (SDS). We examine its
psychometric properties in a sample of Spanish population heterosexual of 1,206
individuals (50% males), distributed across three groups (18-34, 35-49, and 50 years
old or older).We performed Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory. The found
version consists of 18 item distributed into three factors (Acceptance for Male Sexual
Shyness,Acceptance for Female Sexual Freedom and Acceptance for Traditional
Double Standard). A second-order factor structure was also adequate. Internal
consistency, temporal stability and validity evidence are reported. This version of the
SDSS is reliable and valid. It allows to assess the perception of societal sexual double
standard. Its usefulness to improve the predictive validity of the standardized scales
that evaluate the individual adhesion to SDS is discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,norms|psychometric properties|sexual double standard;|social referents,2018-08-29T19:17:02.543498,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-29T16:11:38.608550,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/citation/,x73vb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7gt9w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/relationships/node/,7gt9w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b856c295f932f001aa569b5/,5b856c295f932f001aa569b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x73vb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x73vb/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x73vb

Parental evaluation of child’s participation is often the decision-making factor in the process of special education and/or rehabilitation.
Aims: Examine and compare home and community participation of children with CP and typical development (TD) and the associations between their parents’ desire for change and participation dimensions in both settings.
Methods and procedures: This cross-sectional study included a convenience sample of 110 children with CP (55% males; mean age 12.7 years) and 134 children with TD (49% males; mean age 12.1 years). The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) was used. 
Outcomes and results: Home and community participation and environmental supportiveness of children with CP were lower compared to children with TD (p &lt; .001, family income controlled). The effect sizes indicated that there may be no clinically important difference in participation frequency. Parents of children with CP desired change if participation was less diverse at home, less frequent in the community, or if involvement was lower in both settings (environmental supportiveness and income controlled).
Conclusions and implications: At home, parents expressed a desire for change more intensely through the range of activities, while parents of children with TD emphasized participation frequency. In the community, parents of children with CP equally perceived participation diversity and focused more on frequency and involvement.",TRUE,FALSE,change|children with cerebral palsy|environmental supportiveness|Home and community participation|parental perspective|participation,2018-08-28T11:24:41.468729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-28T11:24:26.443780,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/citation/,wqvh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3jnb9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/relationships/node/,3jnb9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b850d7b465d2100180765ca/,5b850d7b465d2100180765ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wqvh8/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2018.06.010,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wqvh8
