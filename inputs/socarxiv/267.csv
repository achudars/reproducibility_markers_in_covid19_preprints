Evidence from Eastern Congo,"Existing research suggests a strong link between mining and local conflict but makes no distinction between artisanal and industrial mining. We exploit variation in mineral prices and the granting of industrial mining concessions to investigate how the mode of extraction affects conflict in Eastern Congo. Rising mineral prices increase battles over artisanal mines, indicating competition between armed groups. This effect is much less pronounced for industrial mining. Moreover, the expansion of industrial mining decreases battles, suggesting that companies can secure their concessions. Such expansion does, however, trigger riots, and, when it crowds out artisanal mining, also increases violence against civilians and looting. In line with case-study evidence, these negative effects only materialize when industrial mining companies expand their activities from the research to the production phase.",TRUE,FALSE,Africa|Artisanal mining|Conflict|Congo|Industrial mining|Natural resources,2020-01-14T16:24:41.915030,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:16:38.307414,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/citation/,xt9gj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d7d64855d4c012cb71f4b/,5e1d7d64855d4c012cb71f4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xt9gj/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.06.025,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xt9gj

The Impact of Dodd-Frank in the DRC","The Dodd Frank Act was passed by the US Congress in July 2010 and included a provision—Section 1502—that aimed to break the link between conflict and minerals in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. To date there is only one rigorous quantitative analysis that investigates the impact of Dodd-Frank on local conflict events. Looking at the short-term impact (2011–2012), it finds that the policy backfired. This study builds on a larger, more representative, dataset of mining sites and extends the time horizon by three years (2013–2015). The results indicate that the policy also backfired in the longer run, especially in areas home to gold mines. For territories with the average number of gold mines, the introduction of Dodd-Frank increased the incidence of battles with 44%; looting with 51% and violence against civilians with 28%, compared to pre-Dodd Frank averages. Delving deeper into the impact of the conflict minerals legislation is important, as President Trump suspended the legislation in February 2017 for a two-year period, ordering his administration to replace it with another policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Dodd-Frank Act|Legislation|Minerals|Mining|Violence,2020-01-14T16:25:02.521011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:17:10.589200,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/citation/,svwnb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d7c5f855d4c0126b72967/,5e1d7c5f855d4c0126b72967,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/svwnb/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201783,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/svwnb

Yet, experimental tasks are often stripped of any social context, implying that inferences may not directly map to real world contexts. We randomly allocate 632 individuals (grouped randomly into 316 dyads) from small villages in Sierra Leone to four versions of the ultimatum game. In addition to the classic ultimatum game, where both the sender and receiver are anonymous, we reveal the identity of the sender, the receiver or both. This design allows us to explore how fairness behavior is affected by social context in a natural setting where players are drawn from populations that are well-acquainted. We find that average offers increase when the receiver's identity is revealed, suggesting that anonymous ultimatum games underestimate expected fair offers. This study suggest that researchers wishing to relate laboratory behavior to contexts in which the participants are well-acquainted should consider revealing the identities of the players during game play.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-14T16:25:41.863861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:17:42.476804,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/citation/,j54ar,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d7a2a855d4c012cb7194b/,5e1d7a2a855d4c012cb7194b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j54ar/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194037,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j54ar

Coupled with publication and related biases, this latitude raises the concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally select models that yield positive findings, leading to an unreliable body of published research. To combat this ""fishing"" problem in medical studies, leading journals now require preregistration of designs that emphasize the prior identification of dependent and independent variables. However, we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced specification, the scope for
fishing is considerable when there is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing field experiment for which we drafted a complete “mock report"" of findings using fake data on treatment assignment. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of this form of registration and propose that a comprehensive but non-binding approach be adopted as a first step to combat fishing by social scientists. Likely effects of comprehensive but non-binding registration are discussed, the principle advantage being communication rather than commitment, in particular that it generates a clear distinction between exploratory analyses and genuine tests.",TRUE,FALSE,Congo|Fishing|P-hacking|Pre Analysis Plan|Preregistration,2020-01-14T16:26:43.472355,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:18:59.289903,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/citation/,svu29,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d74e7855d4c012cb70f63/,5e1d74e7855d4c012cb70f63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/svu29/,https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mps021,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/svu29

This relationship is characterized by how cooperative or competitive states are with cities in their legislation. Despite the recent attention given to state preemption of local laws, this is not a new phenomenon. Part of the confusion surrounding preemption is that there is no shared definition or understanding of its forms. The purpose of this article is to begin to create that shared conception. In doing so, we define preemption according to its historic origins as the use of coercive methods to substitute state priorities for local policymaking. We argue modern state preemption of local laws can be divided into four phases, each with their own policies and mechanisms. We show how preemption has changed over time, shifting the functional, legal, and political relationship between states and their cities. Together, these phases help assist policymakers and administrators in understanding the nature of state preemption, and thus how to create and implement local policies in an environment where the distribution of power between governments is competitive and changing.",TRUE,FALSE,Intergovernmental relations|Local government autonomy|Preemption,2020-01-14T16:27:41.211331,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:22:17.227244,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/citation/,u2f4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1cfb33855d4c010fb71368/,5e1cfb33855d4c010fb71368,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2f4x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2f4x

The estimation uses a new, large data set of first financing rounds of startup companies. Consistent with efficient contracting theories, there is an optimal equity split between agents, which maximizes the probability of success. However, VCs use their bargaining power to receive more investor-friendly terms compared to the contract that maximizes startup values. Better VCs still benefit the startup and the entrepreneur, due to their positive value creation. Counterfactuals show that reducing search frictions shifts the bargaining power to VCs and benefits them at the expense of entrepreneurs. The results show that selection of agents into deals is a first-order factor to take into account in studies of contracting.",TRUE,FALSE,contracts|entrepreneurship|matching|private equity|venture capital,2020-01-15T14:10:22.051560,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-15T14:10:00.553469,FALSE,NA,no,The data is proprietary and sold by Pitchbook and (now defunct) VentureSource.,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/citation/,hk38u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1ce4c26822bd00e8fef10f/,5e1ce4c26822bd00e8fef10f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk38u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hk38u/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hk38u
