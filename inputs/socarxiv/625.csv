Comparing East and West Germany before reunification allows us to investigate whether vastly different political, economic and educational systems led to differences in IEO. Post-reunification, East Germany adopted the West's systems and experienced an economic recession. IEO had been smaller in East than in West Germany but was on an upward trajectory before reunification. After 1990, IEO in East Germany converged to the West German level as a result of decreased IEO in the West and increasing levels in the East.

The early medieval Insular book users were particularly keen on using such devices. This article maps the usage of technical signs in a corpus of early medieval Irish manuscripts produced on the Continent or preserved and used there early after the production. In the center of the inquiry are four manuscripts belonging to an Irish scholarly circle associated with Sedulius Scottus. The article concludes that: * Insular, and specifically Irish, annotators used a specific repertoire of technical signs; * This Insular/Irish repertoire is substantially distinct from the repertoire of technical signs used by Carolingian scribes and therefore allows for discerning books annotated by Insular/Irish users on the Continent; * A noticeable difference exists between various identifiable clusters of manuscripts annotated by Insular/Irish users, suggesting that different annotators and circles drew on different parts of the Insular repertoire; * The manuscripts from the Sedulius group stand out from among other Irish books produced on the Continent on account of the specific mode of annotation, which seems to have been particular to the circle of scholars that produced them; * The Greek Psalter of Sedulius, which contains the subscription of Sedulius Scottus, displays a pattern of sign use distinct from the one found in the manuscripts from the Sedulius group and therefore does not seem related to them; * One or two lightly-annotated manuscripts contain traces of annotation in the manner of the Sedulius circle and therefore may reflect activities of the scholars from this scholarly group.",TRUE,FALSE,Early medieval history|Early medieval manuscripts|History of the Book|Irish manuscripts|Latin paleography|Manuscript marginalia|Medieval annotation practices|Medieval Ireland|Medieval manuscripts|Sedulius Scottus,2018-07-02T11:38:30.477540,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-08T16:35:59.857724,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdb|Arts and Humanities|History|Medieval History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d21|Arts and Humanities|Medieval Studies,Brepols Publishers,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/citation/,zk9pa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yrx3g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/relationships/node/,yrx3g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a7bb3f1e10700000e1447d1/,5a7bb3f1e10700000e1447d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zk9pa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zk9pa/,https://doi.org/10.1484/M.USML-EB.5.115017,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zk9pa

Circuity results from a circulation network's configuration, planning, and underlying terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use urban space for settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall street network circuity, researchers have not studied the relative circuity of walkable versus drivable circulation networks. This study uses OpenStreetMap data to explore relative network circuity. We download walkable and drivable networks for 40 US cities using the OSMnx software, which we then use to simulate four million routes and analyze circuity to characterize network structure. We find that walking networks tend to allow for more direct routes than driving networks do in most cities: average driving circuity exceeds average walking circuity in all but four of the cities that exhibit statistically significant differences between network types. We discuss various reasons for this phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network circuity also varies substantially between different types of places. These findings underscore the value of using network-based distances and times rather than straight-line when studying urban travel and access. They also suggest the importance of differentiating between walkable and drivable circulation networks when modeling and characterizing urban street networks: although different modes' networks overlap in any given city, their relative structure and performance vary in most cities.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|circuity|cities|driving|geospatial|GIS|graph theory|land use|math|modeling|network analysis|OpenStreetMap|pedestrian|physics|python|simulation|street network|transportation|transportation engineering|urban design|urban morphology|urban planning|urban studies|walkability,2018-07-02T11:38:30.171661,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-07T20:51:18.550253,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/citation/,edj2s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wduc7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/relationships/node/,wduc7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a7b64e6d7f215000f602ac1/,5a7b64e6d7f215000f602ac1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edj2s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/edj2s/,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12381-9_12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/edj2s

Sociologists have identified several possible structural determinants of electricity-based CO2 emissions, including international trade and global normative regimes, national political–legal systems, and organizational size and age. But because they treat these factors as competing predictors, scholars have yet to examine how they might work together to explain why some power plants emit vastly more pollutants than others. Using a worldwide data set of utility facilities and fuzzy-set methods, we analyze the conjoint effects of global, political, and organizational conditions on fossil-fueled plants’ CO2 emissions.

Calls for heightened consideration of fairness and accountability in algorithmically-informed public decisions—like taxation, justice, and child protection—are now commonplace. How might designers support such human values? We interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5 OECD countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values into their work. The results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning—absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. We see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the `street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. We conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithmic accountability|algorithmic discrimination|algorithmic fairness|decision-support|government data science|human-computer interaction|machine learning|screen-level bureaucrats|street-level bureaucrats,2018-07-02T11:38:25.438964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-04T18:55:05.258508,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/citation/,8kvf4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k48fm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/relationships/node/,k48fm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a774f0b68ee49000f397947/,5a774f0b68ee49000f397947,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8kvf4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8kvf4/,https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174014,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8kvf4
