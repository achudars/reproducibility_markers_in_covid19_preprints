Proclus almost certainly has in mind Plotinus in Ennead VI.8.13-22, where the latter attributes self-causation and determination to the One. However in the latter context, Plotinus is rather attempting to show how the One's unity entails that it is the cause of such self-determinative activity manifested in Intellect (as in the earlier Enn. VI.8.1-7). One could conclude, as does John Dillon, that Proclus is giving up an unfair criticism of Plotinus. In this dissertation I offer some support for Proclus' critical stance with an analysis of both figures' positions, starting with a look at (1) self-constitution and its conceptual origin in self-motion; (2) Plotinus on the One's causality; (3) Proclus on the One's causality; and (4) an analysis of Enn. VI.8.13-14 in light of Proclus' critique. While it could be that Proclus takes little account for Plotinus' careful construction in the language of Enn. VI.8.13-22, still Proclus' critique hinges on a different view of causation for the One than Plotinus'. The different stance lies in the background for why Plotinus allows for self-constitution in the One, even if with metaphorical language, while for Proclus such language pertains only to the intermediate level below the One (with e.g. Being, between the One and Intellect) and not up to the One-itself.

Aristotle puts forward that this first principle is a divine intellect which thinks on itself, and in being the highest being in complete actuality and without potentiality, it is also absolutely simple. Plotinus, on the other hand, sees reason to assert that the divine intellect can not be absolutely simple but a duality of some sort. Thus for Plotinus the first principle, as a cause of unity for all things, must be beyond the divine intellect and beyond being as an absolutely simple principle. Comparing Plotinus to Aristotle, Plotinus’ position appears odd at the outset given that he also holds to the divine intellect being completely in act and that it thinks on itself. Why thinking should be dual even when it is self-referential and unified in its activity is not apparent, and so Aristotle’s position seems the more coherent one. Yet, through an analysis of both positions, this dissertation proposes that Plotinus better accounts for the problem of self-intellection as requiring some form of distinction in thought while maintaining an identity between the subject and object of thought. If absolute simplicity is an essential attribute to being the first principle, Plotinus’ position is ultimately more consistent in positing a first principle beyond the divine intellect while also holding to a more coherent understanding of thinking with his understanding of divine intellect as a duality instead of an absolute simplicity.

This imagery goes back to the pagan Neoplatonists, who employ it in their framework to describe the causality of their first principle, the One, in relation to the plurality of the Forms in Intellect. Given this, early-period Neoplatonists, like Plotinus, have a rather different view of the One’s causality compared to later Neoplatonists, like Proclus and Damascius: for Plotinus, the One directly produces Intellect; for later Neoplatonists, like Proclus and Damascius, the One indirectly produces Intellect through an intermediary. Given this, while the general analogy of the circle, radii, and center are the same for all of them, each figure has a different way of describing the analogy, which fits each one’s view of the One’s causality.

This paper focuses particularly on Plotinus, Proclus, and Damascius and their description of the center’s relation and causality of the radii and circle, as part of the analogy to the One, in three particular passages: Plotinus’ Ennead VI.8.18, Proclus’ Commentary on Euclid’s Elements (154–155), and Damascius’ De Principiis I, 93–94. A brief survey will also be made on the sources of the metaphor in Aristotle and Alexander of Aphrodisias, as well as the legacy of the metaphor in Augustine, Eriugena, and Ps.-Dionysius.

Behind this distinction is an essential shift in the One’s causality, both as a response to and critique of Proclus’ One. I look at De Principiis I, 2–4, and I, 92–94, in relation to Proclus, seeing how Damascius transforms the One as causally synonymous with 'all things' (τά πάντα). In doing so, I show that Damascius both retains Proclus' basic argument that the One does not directly pre-contain plurality, and that the One *indirectly* anticipates plurality by causing 'all things'. By holding these two stances, Damascius appears to lead a *via media* between a Plotinian and a Proclean view of the One.

At root is a basic distinction that Proclus employs between unparticipated and participated causes—for instance between the One-itself and henads; Intellect and particular intellects; and so on. Yet coming from those like Plotinus, the distinction may be a surprise: why posit the unparticipated, and what would the distinction add? On Plotinus' interpretation, and following a common conception of Platonic ontology, all participants of a given property only participate in one Form: any further distinction posited would be superfluous.

In this paper I analyze the participation frameworks for both Plotinus and Proclus, focusing specifically on sensibles participating in Forms. I trace the difference to the ontological status of the participants in relation to the property they receive: for Plotinus, there is no distinct property in the participant that is ontologically separate from the intelligible Form; for Proclus, this is not enough—the participant must possess a distinct property apart from the intelligible Form, in order to account for the distinction of properties in one participant from another.

Methods
We used a two-stage method for investigating users' assessments. The user forum of a darknet market that we called 'Merkat' was analysed to develop emergent themes. Qualitative interviews with darknet users were conducted, then forum data was analysed again.  To enhance the applicability of the findings, the forum was sampled for users who presented as dependent as well as recreational.
Results
Quality could mean reliability, purity, potency, and predictability of effect.  We focused on the different kinds of knowledge users drew on to assess quality. These were: embodied; craft; and chemical. 
Conclusion.
Users’ evaluations of quality depended on their experience, the purpose of use, and its context.  Market forums are a case of indigenous harm reduction where users share advise and experiences and can be usefully engaged with on these terms.",TRUE,FALSE,cryptomarkets|darknet|digital sociology|Drugs,2018-07-02T10:59:34.890003,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-17T17:47:43.289630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Angus Bancroft|Peter Scott Reid,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/citation/,ruk4e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xzauc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/relationships/node/,xzauc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59456a629ad5a10239f6aff9/,59456a629ad5a10239f6aff9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ruk4e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ruk4e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ruk4e,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2015.11.008

This paper discusses an interconnection between diversity and technology: web accessibility for all, including people with disabilities. Qualitative interviews were conducted with eight MLIS professors and two students or recent alumni.  Findings showed attitudes regarding teaching web accessibility and recruitment of a diverse student body varied between professors who were familiar with web accessibility and those who were not.  Participants who were familiar with web accessibility often thought it should be included within ALA Standards for Accreditation.  Findings suggested that, in one school, incorporating diversity in their curriculum, including web accessibility, allowed recruitment of a more diverse student body and was furthering diversity-related curriculum content. At another school, a professor expressed concern about recruiting a diverse student body, particularly students with disabilities.  The research suggests that stronger practices for teaching technology, teaching diversity, and recruiting diverse students could assist the field of LIS to further realize its inclusive goals.

Within substance abuse research, quantitative methodologists tend to view randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the “gold standard” for estimating causal effects, in part due to experimental manipulation and random assignment. Such methods are not always possible due to ethical and other reasons. Causal directed acyclic graphs (causal DAGs) are mathematical tools for (1) precisely stating researchers' causal assumptions and (2) providing guidance regarding the specification of statistical models for causal inference with nonexperimental data (such as epidemiological data). Purpose. This manuscript describes causal DAGs and illustrates their use in regards to a long standing theory within the field of substance use: the gateway hypothesis. Design. Data from the 2013 National Survey of Drug Use and Health are utilized to illustrate the application of causal DAGs in model specification. Then using the model specification constructed via causal DAGs, logistic regression models are used to generate odds ratios of the likelihood of trying heroin, given that one has tried alcohol, marijuana, and/or tobacco. Conclusion. Granting the assumptions encoded in specific causal DAGs, researchers, even in the absence of RCTs, can identify and estimate causal effects of interest.",TRUE,FALSE,acyclic graphs|substance abuse researchers,2018-07-02T10:59:34.541420,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-16T15:43:55.563355,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/citation/,8k7sp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vkdch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/relationships/node/,vkdch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5943fb94b83f690229ba0f15/,5943fb94b83f690229ba0f15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8k7sp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8k7sp,https://doi.org/10.4303/jdar/235992
