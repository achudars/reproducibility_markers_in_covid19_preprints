CMC researchers have suggested that emoticons behave much as do facial expressions in face-to-face interaction (e.g. Danet, Ruedenberg-Wright, &amp; Rosenbaum-Tamari, 1997; Rezabek &amp; Cochenour, 1998; Thompson &amp; Foulger, 1996). Some fMRI research suggests, however, that there is not a direct neural correspondence between emoticons and facial expressions, but that emoticons play an important role in determining the positive or negative valence of an utterance (Yuasa, Saito, &amp; Mukawa, 2011). Following the affective priming paradigm developed by Fazio, Sanbonmatsu, Powell, and Kardes (1986), this study explores the priming effects of emoticons vis-à-vis photographs of facial expression and emotional words on valence judgements of emotionally charged words. Significant main effects of age, prime valence, and target valence were found. There were also significant interactions between these three factors. Overall results suggest that younger and older participants have differing experiences of emoticons, with younger participants experiencing an effect of emoticons that is similar to the effect of facial expressions while older adults seem to experience emoticons in ways more like textual information or even just textual nonsense.",TRUE,FALSE,affect|CMC|computer mediated communication|emoticons|emotion|facial expression|FACS|psycholinguistics|sociolinguistics,2019-12-04T11:31:03.910676,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04T11:30:36.302801,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e00|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics,Brittney O'Neill,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/citation/,3zrf6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de6b62ae1e62f000b33ba31/,5de6b62ae1e62f000b33ba31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3zrf6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3zrf6,NA

The traditional publishing model does not support public access (i.e., no publisher paywall barrier) to scholarly journals. Newer models of publishing allow free access to research including open access publishing and deposit of scholarship in institutional or disciplinary repositories. This study examined public access to articles in the top 25 social work journals. A random sample of article citations from a total of 1,587 was assessed, with the result that 52% of citations had no full-text access. Of the remaining 48% of citations with full-text access, it is questionable most will remain available long term due to possible copyright violations. Citations from the random sample show only minimal usage of institutional or disciplinary repositories as a means of sharing research. Establishing this baseline measure of access to research is an important first step in understanding the barriers for social workers in accessing research to inform practice.

This renewed interest has been informed by new approaches that emphasize sensitive and critical periods during the first years of life, offer an understanding of human development as a hierarchical and cross-fertilizing process, suggest plausible mechanisms for the persistent effect of early exposures, and explore heterogeneity in effects based on environmental and biological factors. The articles included in this special issue of Population Research and Policy Review advance the field of early-life circumstances in several important dimensions. They examine the determinants and effects of noxious exposures at different developmental stages—ranging from the prenatal period to adolescence—in a variety of national settings.

aggressive face-work. In the third part, I take Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of faciality as a point of departure for understanding micro-fascism. As an abstract machine,
Trump’s faciality opens up possibilities of authoritarian micropolitics around a messenger/disrupter in chief. It works in connection with a landscape and relative to a
collective assemblage of enunciation that extracted a territory of perception and affect.

An Experimental Study Looking at Survey Modes, Respondent Traits and the Desirability of Survey Topics and Individual Questions","This study looks at negative attitudes towards various out-groups and examines in an experimental design the influence of anonymous interview settings on estimates of attitudes towards supposedly sensitive topics. Respondents were presented with instruments meant to measure various forms of prejudice towards out-groups while the interview was conducted at random either as a computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) or computer assisted self interview (CASI). The scales used in this study can be shown to be both reliable as well as valid, furthermore, in accordance with various research by Bierly (1985), Zick et al. (2008) and Heitmeyer (2005) the results of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) show various forms of prejudice form a type of generalized attitude. In the more recent articles from Zick et al. (2008), Heitmeyer (2005), Wagner et al. (2008), this is referred to as the ‘Syndrome  Group-Focused  Enmity’  (GFE).  So  while  both  an  overarching ‘syndrome’ of prejudice as well as valid and reliable measures of individual forms of prejudice can be empirically confirmed, the results of the analyses show that prejudice towards a specific out-group, let alone a generalized attitude of prejudice, cannot be seen as uniformly desirable.

Results from a longitudinal study using the theory of planned behaviour,"This study looks at pre-service teachers, their usage of experiments in the classroom, and the factors that influence their behavior. In a longitudinal panel-study of high school/grammar school-level biology and chemistry pre-service teachers at all training colleges in the German State of Rhineland-Palatinate, we examine the role of attitudes, perceived behavioral controls, and subjective norms on the participants’ intention to- and actual use of experiments in the classroom. As a theoretical framework, we use the Theory of Planned Behavior. Attitudes, social norms, behavioural control and behavioural intention were measured at time points t1 and t2; behaviour with regards to experiments was measured at t3. In a second step, we examine which fundamental beliefs influence attitudes, social norms and behavioural control. The analyses show that attitudes, subjective norms and behavioural controls play important roles in determining the use of experiments. While for pre-service teachers with the subject biology attitudes play the most important role, for those with the subject chemistry it is behavioural control that most strongly influences the use experiments. The reform of teachers’ education programs in Germany has no significant effects on the intent or actual behaviour regarding experiments.",TRUE,FALSE,behaviour|experiments|inquiry-based teaching|natural science teaching|theory of planned behaviour,2019-12-04T04:29:06.155476,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04T04:28:43.955213,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/citation/,dntw2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de62feb84c479000c775a6e/,5de62feb84c479000c775a6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dntw2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dntw2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dntw2,NA

Estimate whether police legitimacy predicts willingness to cooperate in weak-norm neighborhoods, but not in strong-norm neighborhoods, where most people are willing to cooperate (or not to cooperate) irrespective of their perceptions of police legitimacy. 
 
Methods: A survey of 1,057 individuals in 98 relatively high-crime neighborhoods defined at a small spatial scale measured (a) willingness to cooperate using a hypothetical crime vignette and (b) legitimacy using indicators of normative alignment between police and citizen values. A mixed-effects, location-scale model estimated the cluster-level mean and cluster-level variance of willingness to cooperate as a neighborhood-level latent variable. A cross-level interaction tested whether legitimacy predicts individual-level willingness to cooperate only in neighborhoods where the norm is weak.

Results: Willingness to cooperate clustered strongly by neighborhood. There were neighborhoods with (i) high mean and low variance, (ii) high mean and high variance, (iii) (relatively) low mean and low variance, and (iv) (relatively) low mean and high variance. Legitimacy was only a positive predictor of cooperation in neighborhoods that had a (relatively) low mean and high variance. There was little variance left to explain in neighborhoods where the norm was strong. 

Conclusions: Findings support a boundary condition of procedural justice theory: namely, cooperation can be modelled as a placed-based norm that varies in strength from neighborhood to neighborhood and legitimacy only predicts cooperation in neighborhoods where the norm is relatively weak.",TRUE,FALSE,legitimacy|location-scale|multi-level|neighbourhoods|norms|police|trust,2019-12-04T04:27:02.348708,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04T04:26:42.740701,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/citation/,jb74u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de62d0ee1e62f000c351f27/,5de62d0ee1e62f000c351f27,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jb74u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jb74u,NA
