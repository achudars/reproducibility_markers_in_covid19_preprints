An inclusive economy is increasingly recognised as an effective way to tackle widening inequalities within populations and ensure nations can “build back better” after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the different mechanisms that can be used to deliver an inclusive economy are not well established, and the strength and quality of evidence supporting such mechanisms are yet to be synthesised. 
Aim. To systematically review the literature to identify the political, economic and social mechanisms that can be used to deliver an inclusive economy. 
Search methods. We will search eight peer-reviewed databases including EconLit, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Proquest Public Health Database, Embase and Medline. Grey literature will be searched using Google Scholar and websites for various governmental and non-governmental organisations. 
Selection criteria. We will include literature reviews assessing the impact of social, political and/or economic mechanisms that can deliver an inclusive economy. Relevant exposures include any population-level social, political or economic mechanisms and relevant outcomes include increased equity in any of the following: (i) opportunities, e.g. access to education, training, employment, owning and running businesses, owning and managing community assets, finance; (ii) the experiences of people in different social classes, and (iii) the distribution of the economy’s outcomes, e.g. resources, good quality jobs and living standards, and power, income and wealth.  
Data collection and analysis. A modified version of the AMSTAR-2 criteria will be used for critical appraisal. Data will then be synthesised qualitatively (or quantitatively, where applicable) giving greater weight to higher quality reviews. 
Discussion: Our review will synthesise the available reviewed evidence on mechanisms that have been evaluated in relation to inclusive economy outcomes. This will help policymakers and practitioners identify potential interventions and levers that can be used to deliver an inclusive economy. We will also assess the depth as well as the strengths and weaknesses in existing reviewed evidence base and identify areas that require further reviews of primary research and evaluation.",TRUE,FALSE,inclusive economy|inequalities|wellbeing economy,2021-01-15T22:05:41.793274,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-15T22:05:11.770476,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,available,NA,https://osf.io/swt4e,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,Public Health Scotland,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/citation/,dctk5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vs852/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/relationships/node/,vs852,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffed647e80d37048ca58831/,5ffed647e80d37048ca58831,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dctk5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dctk5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dctk5,NA

In-depth interviews with migrant families in Shanghai reveal that many remain unconvinced that the future of their children is strongly affected by this policy. Rather, they devalue the importance of formal education and emphasize individual effort and alternative pathways to success. By drawing on theories of cognition and the sociology of understanding, I argue that their perceptions of this policy are formed through three processes of validation: recognition of certain views by authorities such as school teachers, social workers, and the media; corroboration with the daily experiences of living in a modern city; and resonance with past experience. This study asserts the importance of immediate context and overall everyday life experiences in shaping perception toward policies.

The reasons behind this preference for online shopping are examined in this study through 63 in-depth interviews and 5 years of virtual ethnography of a major online shopping website in China called Taobao.com. Chinese customers prefer Taobao not only because of price and convenience, but also because they enjoy the interactional process, during which they obtain more information, feel less pressured to put on a status performance in comparison to physical stores, and pay less affective labor. Chinese customers tend to believe that interaction with sales clerks in physical shops is a burden, and try to avoid this form of contact. This is related to the fact that consensus on status hierarchy is still yet to be established in a society that is undergoing rapid transition. Consequently, online shopping entails social interaction that attributes more power, autonomy and freedom to customers than otherwise possible in brick-and-mortar shopping. This study shows how both the online interactional environments afforded by technology and the broader social contexts (the service quality and related aspects of status competition among different social groups in contemporary China) affect interpersonal interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,China|consumption|online shopping|power dynamics|status competition|symbolic interaction,2021-01-13T22:44:21.895695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T13:23:44.454641,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption,TIAN XIAOLI,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/citation/,5p7sa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffe9561e80d370468a58089/,5ffe9561e80d370468a58089,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p7sa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5p7sa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5p7sa,https://doi.org/10.1007/S11133-018-9397-8

The case is made primarily by Mises and Hayek in the 1920s and 1930s with a further contribution by Lavoie in the 1980s. Their argument can be broken down into two elements. Firstly, only the competitive market process can give prices the coordinative meaning necessary for economic calculation. Secondly, we cannot do without capitalists. To begin with, there has to be people with “skin in the game”; and, furthermore, those running socialist firms would not be in a position to replace the capitalists in the entrepreneurial role that the latter perform in an ever-changing economy. An examination of the key writings on these questions by these three economists reveals that their case rests on very shaky ground. The case is weakened further when one looks at the ways  in which a socialist price system could be an improvement on what capitalism offers.

The emergence of collective bargaining comes from the triadic interaction among three conflicting agents: workers, local state and employers. The intention of the local state to shift labor-intensive industries towards more value-added industries and the tendency of the local police to avoid the use of violence have contributed to a less hostile labor environment and more political opportunities for the workers. To improve their own position and control labor unrest, regional unions form a vertical coalition with workers while autoworkers invoke their workplace bargaining power by engaging in strikes. At the same time, workers develop low risk strike strategies to reduce potential state suppression and employ anti-Japanese rhetoric to reduce pressure from management. We conclude with a discussion on whether the collective bargaining practices of autoworkers in Guangzhou can be replicated in other spaces or industries.",TRUE,FALSE,autoworkers|China|enterprise collective bargaining|worker activism,2021-01-13T22:46:22.695983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T13:24:39.856902,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,Yunxue Deng and Xiaoli Tian,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/citation/,82chy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffe66d386541a045d14b235/,5ffe66d386541a045d14b235,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82chy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/82chy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/82chy,NA

Evidence from Activist Investors,"Abstract We study the effect of investor disagreement on informed trading by activist investors using high-frequency disagreement data derived from the investor social network StockTwits. Greater investor disagreement leads to more trading in the subsequent day by privately-informed activists. Disagreement leads to higher prices and improvements in measured liquidity, but these observed valuation and market liquidity differences do not explain the increase in activist trading. Instead, investor disagreement affects activist trading primarily by facilitating trading by non-activist investors. These findings suggest that investor disagreement not only affects trading by uninformed investors, but also facilitates trading by informed market participants who often take actions aimed at changing corporate policies.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-13T22:47:04.251283,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T13:25:02.622122,FALSE,NA,no,We use data from StockTwits to construct our disagreement measures.
