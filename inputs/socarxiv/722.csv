This lets citizens not only comment to government, but co-produce government. To enable this, government leaders should:

* Welcome the Civic Hackers - Local government leaders have had some notable successes cooperating with civic hackers to leapfrog the business-as-usual approach of government and its contractors.

* Eat Your Own Dog Food - When a government leader makes her agency’s databases shareable with citizens, this will also make the databases more reliable for the agency.

* Don’t Panic about Guerrilla Government - Technology is making off-the-clock engagement by government employees both inevitable and productive.

These task demands can often be predicted by the context, and the implicit learning of these probabilistic context-task associations may enhance task performance. While previous studies have focused on how task cues that are either probabilistic or implicit affect task-switching performance, the present study investigated how people learn and use contextual cues that are both implicit and probabilistic within a cued task-switching design. Participants showed response speed benefits when engaging in tasks that were predicted to be more likely by a preceding contextual cue. However, this probabilistic cueing effect was only seen when specific contextual cues were associated with task probabilities (Experiment 2), and not when contextual categories were associated with task probabilities (Experiment 1). The findings provide support for automatic activation of multiple task sets; a model of multiple concurrent task set activation and representation is proposed. Taken together, our findings suggest that people can implicitly learn probabilistic associations between specific contexts and tasks, and can use information from contexts to guide adaptive behaviour in dynamic environments.",TRUE,FALSE,associative learning|context|implicit learning|situational awareness|task set,2018-07-02T10:53:46.013587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-20T04:29:54.572000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/citation/,vz2gd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7exfr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/relationships/node/,7exfr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cf58826c613b01fded87f6/,58cf58826c613b01fded87f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz2gd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vz2gd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vz2gd

Private Governance in Brazil's Jogo do Bicho,"This article presents a rational choice account of Brazil's jogo do bicho ('animal game'), possibly the largest illegal lottery game in the world. In over 120 years, the jogo do bicho has grown from a local raffle to a multimillion-dollar business, and the game has played a major role in Brazil's cultural and political life. My analysis of the jogo do bicho has three goals. First, I examine the mechanisms that fostered the lottery's notable growth outside the boundaries of Brazilian law. Second, I investigate how the animal game financiers combine costly signals and selective incentives to induce cooperation from members of the community. Lastly, I discuss the relationship between the lottery sponsors and Brazilian representatives, particularly how the bicheiros exploit the fragmentation of Brazil's political system to advance their long-term interests.

The selection of the corpus was based on practical reasons. The data was analysed descriptively by using frequencies and percentages. The findings revealed that there was a number of translation strategies used frequently to translate food menus in the corpus in questions which are: borrowing, literal translation, using a super ordinate word, amplification, reduction and using a load word plus an explanation respectively. The usage of these strategies caused several problems such as lexical ambiguity, lack of clarity and confusion.

The research questions are as follows: 1) What is the source text producer’s appraisal? 2) What is the translator’s appraisal? And how is the translator’s appraisal reflected in the target texts? 3) What are the differences between the source text producer’s appraisal and the translator’s appraisal? 4) What are the possible reasons for the translator to choose his/her appraisal and produce “unfaithful” translations? In order to anwer these questions, five Chinese public notices and their English translations which were mainly collected in Hong Kong and Macao are investigated in the present study. The source and target texts are analyzed with the Appraisal theory and then compared to find out their respective appraisal. The findings show that for both Attitude and Engagement parts, the appraisal between source texts and target texts is rather different. Some possible motivations are then explored. It is believed that socio-cultural environment is one of the most important factors influencing translators’ decision making in translating public notices.

In the backdrop of this, this paper aims to demonstrate how analytical dimension of literary studies can be expanded by involving Grice’s (1975) pragmatic stylistic theory of Cooperative Priciple (CP) and explores how the fictional discourses could be better understood by reconstructing inferential chains of interpretation along with various issues of inferences in the dialogic discourses of the characters from Vikram Seth’s magnum opus A Suitable Boy (ASB). The CP contributes to contextualization of the text; provides interpretative possibilities that explain how we draw inferences from conversation; and hints to interpretations of how direct and indirect discourses are manipulated in literary works of fiction. The major findings of this paper suggest that the real value and richness of conversational maxims of Grice lie not in observing but in flouting them and that the major motivation for violating the requirements of these maxims are related to characters’ socio-cultural concerns such as politeness, tact, social power and taboos and also to the inter-personal factors like various cross-purposes, attitudes, personal tensions, conflicts, etc. Arriving at pragmatic meanings through the maxims of CP involves effort and increases engagement with the text; therefore, the author strongly recommends that pragmatic stylistic analysis be frequently included as an important pedagocial activity of studying fictional discourses in the teaching of language and literature.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:48:34.324794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:52:26.157000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/citation/,e2vgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rjhhb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/relationships/node/,rjhhb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb78edb83f6901f9929321/,58cb78edb83f6901f9929321,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2vgs/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no1.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2vgs
