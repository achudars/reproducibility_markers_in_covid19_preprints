Acuff Rose Music, Inc.","A tricky question emerges from the Supreme Court's decision in Campbell: If a parodic work, to use Justice Souter's words, shades into satire, is it no longer classifiable (and therefore no longer defensible) as a parody? Should it be regarded as having crossed a critical boundary for fair use purposes? Campbell suggests that it should, but there are actually compelling reasons, rooted in principles underlying the doctrine of fair use, why some types of parodic works that shade into satire should not be regarded as infringing. After examining the curious development of the parody/satire distinction within the law of fair use, this article draws on literary theory to propose a workable and more accurate taxonomy than that provided in Campbell, by means of which courts engaging in a fair use analysis can evaluate works that are hybrids of parody and satire.

For policymakers, the issue has sat on the horizon, always within view but never actually pressing. To recognize this fact, however, is not to say that we can or should ignore the challenge that AI authorship presents to copyright law's underlying assumptions about creativity. On the contrary, the relatively slow development of AI offers a reprieve from the reactive, crisis-driven model of policymaking that has dominated copyright law in the digital era.

By engaging and extending insights from two relatively discrete lines of existing scholarship - the postmodern critique of romantic authorship and the more pragmatic literature on copyright in works produced with the aid of computers - this Article seeks to answer the vexing copyright questions that arise from the artificially intelligent production of cultural works. It does so by developing the argument that all creativity is inherently algorithmic and that works produced autonomously by computers are therefore less heterogeneous to both their human counterparts and the current structure of copyright law than appearances may at first suggest.

Despite growing research on health and residential contexts, relatively little is understood about gendered contexts that are differentially important for women's and men's physical health in low- and middle-income countries. This study advances the prior knowledge by examining whether the local frequency of a salient and gendered practice in India—dowry—is associated with gender differences in physical health (acute illness, illness length, and chronic illness). Analyses are conducted using multilevel logistic and negative binomial regression models and national data on men and women across India (N = 102,763). Results show that as dowry frequency increases in communities, not only do women have a greater likelihood of poor health across all three health outcomes, but men also have a greater likelihood of acute illness and illness length. Men, however, have a lower likelihood of chronic illness as the frequency of dowry increases in communities. In the case of all three health outcomes, results showed consistently wider health gaps between men and women in communities with a higher frequency of dowry.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:08.137910,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T14:56:47.737000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/citation/,ft2j5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rnvvw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/relationships/node/,rnvvw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578cee319ad5a101f7953173/,578cee319ad5a101f7953173,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ft2j5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ft2j5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ft2j5

Building on the implications of qualitative work from India and urbanism theories, I aim to understand whether religious bonding social capital in contemporary India increases with greater urbanization and whether such increases are moderated by caste or social class position. Results from multinomial logistic regression on 1,417 Hindu respondents in a nationally representative sample of India (World Values Survey-India 2001) indicate that religious bonding is fostered by urbanism and that this association is stronger for upper castes. But there is little evidence that social class similarly moderates the association between urbanism and religious bonding. In light of these findings, religious bonding might be better understood as rooted in the interaction of caste dynamics and changes in the urban environment, rather than as a result of greater affluence. The data are also consistent with work underscoring the importance of disentangling social class and caste among Hindus in contemporary India.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:50.277131,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T14:49:09.356000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/citation/,qhfxs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a9tr3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/relationships/node/,a9tr3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578cec67b83f690200e26854/,578cec67b83f690200e26854,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhfxs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qhfxs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qhfxs

This study uses new national data (Baylor Religion Survey 2007) to estimate models of religious activity (church activities and devotional activities) and of religious belief (supernatural beliefs, biblical literalism, and religious exclusivity). Among U.S. Christians, congregational social embeddedness is a robust predictor of all religiosity outcomes and is among the largest effects in models. These effects are not substantially moderated by religious tradition, although Catholic affiliation attenuates the positive relationship between social embeddedness and church activities. These findings strongly suggest that social sanctions and solidarity rewards within congregational social networks play an important role in heightening religiosity.

By doing so, they will also promote the continuing vitality of libraries as partners in the educational mission.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:08.696763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T13:58:56.140000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/citation/,fwzph,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ugrwc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/relationships/node/,ugrwc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578ce0acb83f6901fde2683e/,578ce0acb83f6901fde2683e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwzph/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fwzph/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fwzph

of Neamț County (Romania) using thematic cartography. The geographical
approach to this issue is difficult because the lack of a geostatistic
database at commune scale. Spatial analysis of waste indicators reveals
several disparities between localities. Comparability of data between
communes located in various geographical conditions must be carefully made
according to local waste management systems. Several dysfunctionalities are
outlined in order to compare these results, on the one hand, between
localities, and on the one hand, between recent years. Geographical
analysis of waste generation rates is imperative for a proper monitoring of
this sector. Data from 2009, 2010 and 2012 shows that rural waste
management is in a full process of change towards a more organized, stable
and efficient system",TRUE,FALSE,NA,cartography|geography|maps|Preprint|rural development|rural geography|socarxiv|waste indicators|waste management,2018-07-02T10:55:05.405422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T13:27:02.398000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/citation/,z7xpj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zpjzk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/relationships/node/,zpjzk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578cd92f9ad5a101fe953172/,578cd92f9ad5a101fe953172,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7xpj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z7xpj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z7xpj
