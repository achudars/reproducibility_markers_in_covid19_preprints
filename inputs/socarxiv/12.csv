Drawing on our research studying the metascience movement, we suggest that the drive to maximize efficiency in science is increasingly extending beyond performance metrics, into labs themselves. Because institutional and public audiences are predisposed to viewing science in simple terms, it can be challenging for scientists to articulate counterarguments to policies that increase transparency and accountability in the name of efficiency.

Youth is a deeply studied social component but mainly as an object of investigation or, when addressed as a subject to be investigated, mainly from a psychological stance. This social component “will inherit the World” but its point of view on present times reality and its vision about actual problems and perspectives are scarcely investigated. One of the main issues linked to youth is the educational emergency: educational systems in the industrialized societies are in a crisis, given that they use great amounts of resources but their effectiveness is progressively declining and their action results in a growing inadequacy of preparation and in a shrinking of competences for the young.
Methodology. We surveyed a sample of Italian Youth, specifically 111 students of 4th and 5th year (the last ones) of Italian High School (age 17-19). We used an opened answer questionnaire, divided into 4 Sections (the World, Life, School/Education, and Rights/Duties) and collected data through support by the involved schools. Questionnaire filling was totally anonymous and no personal data were collected. We chose a qualitative approach and did not predispose any category in which the answers should be distributed; rather, we aimed to examine in deep all the answers and draw “from the inside” the categories to be used. That’s what we did. We pointed out 5 categories, cut across the 4 Sections of the questionnaire, which substantially described in dichotomous variables the degree of openness of the respondents’ stances: social dimension (close/open), spatial horizon (near/far), time horizon considered (present vs. past-future), the own sense of responsibility (passive/active), and realism (concrete/fantastic). Through the distribution of the answers in such categories we built radar-shape graphics representing the respondents’ point of view.
Principal Findings. At first we checked the amount of the unanswered questions and the text of the answers in order to assess the suitability of collected data. We found that our sample had answered willingly and sincerely to our questions. About the qualitative analysis, we found that the emerging picture revealed narrow visions, almost exclusively focusing on present time, a tendency to remove responsibility and a preference for unrealistic stances. We created the image of the “bubble”: it looked like if the sample was included in a bubble preventing the widening of minds, visions and actions. This can be interpreted as a substantial unpreparedness to active life and to the global problems young generations will face in their aging. This makes even more crucial the educational emergency: diffusion of culture and cultural contents must be improved, but this is not just a question of learning more contents and acquiring more competences. The question is to mature the role of “citizens of the World”, the only way youth has to effectively tackle the global challenges they are going to directly face in next years.",TRUE,FALSE,High School|Rights &amp; Duties|Vision of the young about life &amp; world|Youth|Youth culture,2021-05-13T12:23:25.973581,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-13T12:23:03.202796,FALSE,NA,no,An XLS table containing the raw database of the answers participants gave to the questionnaires is submitted in Supplemental Material here along with our manuscript.,,no,No preregistration was presented.,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/citation/,sajbe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mp2eg/,mp2eg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609c145f3c657b00f50ca72d/,609c145f3c657b00f50ca72d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sajbe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sajbe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sajbe,NA

The academic research in this area is split, though, with some suggesting that such divisions exist and others arguing that they ultimately fail to materialize in real-world behavior. In this study, I use network methods to evaluate whether such partisan cultural polarization exists at the individual-level. I do so by constructing networks of shared cultural preferences and networks of shared political beliefs based on closed-ended survey responses. For each network, I calculate the assortativity (correlation) between linked respondents' partisan identity, ideology, age, gender, race, and education level. I show that the assortativity for the political identity measures is low across the cultural-preference networks compared to the political-belief networks.

Reducing this waste is key to decreasing negative environmental impacts from the food sector and increasing food security in developing countries. Yet, achieving food waste reduction is challenging. It is widely presumed that efforts at stronger food waste governance may increase food prices, and hence consumer and citizen opposition that renders effective governance politically unfeasible. Here, we assess this critical presumption and argue that policy framing and design can ensure public support for ambitious but costly food waste governance, while policy feedbacks from voluntary firm actions are unlikely to diminish public support. Our empirical analysis uses survey experiments with a population-representative sample (N=3’329) from a typical high-income country with a unique direct democratic tradition, Switzerland. First, in a combined framing and conjoint experiment, we show that messages emphasizing national or international social norms in favor of reducing food waste (policy framing) can increase public support for more ambitious reduction targets. We also show that a majority of citizens support food waste governance that leads to substantial increases in food prices, but only if such policies set stringent reduction targets and are transparently monitored (policy design). Finally, in a vignette experiment, we show that voluntary industry initiatives do not crowd out individuals’ intentions to reduce their food waste nor support for stronger governmental regulation, but even crowd public support in if industry initiatives are unambitious (policy feedback). Our research offers an analytical template for studying public support for food waste governance and shows that there is more political room for adopting ambitious policies than hitherto presumed.",TRUE,FALSE,food waste governance|norms|public opinion|public-private policy|survey experiment,2021-05-12T14:59:24.172758,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-12T14:57:52.202879,FALSE,NA,no,Will be published upon acceptance.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Lukas Fesenfeld|Lukas Rudolph|Thomas Bernauer,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/citation/,vh58r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609bad183c657b00ca0d041e/,609bad183c657b00ca0d041e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vh58r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vh58r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vh58r,NA

Issues created by such pandemic viz. loss of communication; shut down of school, college and universities; disruption of the formal learning process; damage of print materials, etc. provoke the transformation of the learning process from conventional to digital. A sophisticated &amp; multitasking platform for online learning is the primary requirement of this transformation, which conforms to the 5A's of access, i.e., Availability, Adequacy, Accessibility, Affordability, and Appropriateness. It bridges the digital divide by ensuring equal access to the web for all. In this paper, the authors have conducted a comparative analysis between the most commonly used web-conferencing tools (viz. FCC, ZOOM, GTM, Join.me &amp; Cisco WebEx) in India, both in terms of users’ &amp; economic perspective. The Users’ perspective was determined by conducting a short online survey using a Google form questionnaire. The survey contains 450 respondents equally distributed among three sample groups, viz. Students, faculty members &amp; library professionals. And the Economical compatibility is identified by solely using the tools &amp; check their pricing &amp; plans. After evaluation &amp; comparison, the study identified that the tool FCC (Free Conference Call), can use by learners and educators as an alternative solution to the physical classroom. This is a dissemination or sharing platform and the most versatile and comprehensive free web-conferencing solution which can be used by academic institutions and educators for online classes. Besides, this paper also goes through a basic overview of 5 A’s of access and provides sufficient evidence that FCC meets all the five criteria of accessibility to clarify the judgment of its acceptance.",TRUE,FALSE,5 A's of Access|Cisco WebEx|COVID-19|Digital divide|Digital learning|FCC|FreeConferenceCall|GTM|Join.me|Web Conferencing|ZOOM,2021-05-12T14:59:02.833758,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-12T14:57:24.077895,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://gvpress.com/journals/IJCSITE/vol6_no1/2.pdf,available,NA,https://zenodo.org/record/4750827#.YJtiW6gzbIU,prereg_both,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/citation/,ewd8n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609b6b153c657b00890ce44b/,609b6b153c657b00890ce44b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd8n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewd8n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewd8n,https://doi.org/10.21742/ijcsite.2021.6.1.02
