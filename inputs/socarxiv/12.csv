Concurrently, urban economists have identi?ed that cities and metro areas within a coherent, connected system of cities have population distributions that follow a power law. Further, subpopulations with equal mobility should also have pop- ulation distributions that follow a power law. Using this insight, we introduce a novel method for identifying whether or not racial segregation between metro areas is due to geographical patterns of immigration into coherent systems or due to constrained mobility. We demonstrate the potential of this method by measuring the coherence of the U.S. urban system from 1910-2010 for the white, Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations. Black residents were only distributed across cities in a coherent system after the Great Migration, while Asian and Hispanic residents reached coherence more quickly and stayed coherent more consistently. It appears the Black reverse migration to the south has unsettled their power law distribution. We also ?nd that the size of those networks di?er across populations, and these di?erences are not an artifact of the relative size of the di?erent populations.

The model was first formalized by a group of engineers and economists associated with engineering professor Fred Schweppe, at MIT. From his position as a leading control theorist, well-known in the industry, Schweppe proposed an expansion of control theory that he argued would help break the deadlock in regulatory politics and benefit producers and consumers of power alike. He introduced the approach, which he called “homeostatic control” around 1978 in a seminar of the MIT Energy Lab. Derived by way of a biological metaphor, homeostatic control conceives of a self-correcting system that maintains its equilibrium state in the face of a changing environment. As Schweppe and his collaborators put it, their aim was “an efficient, internally-correcting control scheme” . Homeostatic control marked a departure from the “load-following” approach of system operators, who would constantly adjust the dispatch of power to meet the changing demand, or load. Schweppe’s group envisioned bringing consumers of power into the control system by constantly feeding them signals in the form of prices. The MIT team discovered through the contact between economists and engineers, the calculation for determining efficient prices is identical to the calculation used by engineers for meeting system load while minimizing costs. The Lagrange multipliers, or lambdas, derived from the engineering optimization are the best estimates of the marginal cost, and therefore the efficient prices, at each node of the system.",TRUE,FALSE,electricity markets|engineering|market design,2021-02-19T05:01:41.410685,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:01:14.577026,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/citation/,8pe49,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602d5db17bf1b7001e5367b8/,602d5db17bf1b7001e5367b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8pe49/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8pe49,https://doi.org/10.1215/00182702-8718023

Reducing carbon emissions to zero fast enough to avoid catastrophic global warming is difficult; doing so while also reducing economic inequality so as to avert social disintegration and democratic backsliding is very difficult. Addressing this twin challenge will require the state – and the European Union – to deploy all economic policy instruments already at its disposal, and to develop new ones and coordinate their use in new ways. The paper proceeds in three steps. The first section discusses three distinct challenges – legal, political, and ideational – for the debate on the future of central banking. The remainder of the paper will tackle the two main ideational challenges, namely, institutional amnesia (forgetting past realities of central banking) and strategic ignorance (ignoring present realities of central banking). To overcome institutional amnesia, the second section briefly reviews the history of central banking, showing that the price stability is only one of several goals that central banking has, historically, been associated with.

These studies focus on both supply side factors that concern the traits of populist actors and demand side factors in the form of characteristics of the supporters. However, we still lack a solid understanding of how these supply and demand side factors interact to explain the support of populist leaders. We contribute to this literature by examining the interplay of two central supply side factors, people-centeredness and nativism, and two demand side factors, political dissatisfaction and generational differences, in determining populist support. We test these explanations by leveraging a choice-based conjoint analysis embedded in a representative sample of the Finnish population (n=1030). The results show that while both people-centeredness and nativism enhance the favourability of prospective political leaders, it is only nativism that it more appealing to the politically dissatisfied.

Sexual stigma and prejudice exist in sport and leisure (Herek, 2009). This study employs descriptive and regression analyses of the National Sports and Society Survey (N = 3,993) to examine the patterns and implications of sexual stigma and prejudice in sports contexts by focusing on U.S. adults’ reports of sports-related mistreatment and involvement. Results indicate that about 1/3 of adults perceive sports as unwelcoming to LGBT athletes and nearly 40% report experiencing sports-related mistreatment; adults who identify as a sexual minority are particularly likely to perceive sports as unwelcoming and to report personal mistreatment. They are also less likely than self-identified heterosexuals to play, spectate, and talk about sports; sports-related mistreatment and childhood sports histories do not explain these patterns. Overall, the findings suggest that more action is needed to offset the presence and influence of sexual stigma and prejudice and to provide more welcoming sports environments for all.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|sexualities|sports involvement|sports mistreatment,2021-02-17T14:56:42.196855,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-17T14:51:52.356408,FALSE,NA,no,Data for the National Sports and Society Survey is in the process of being prepared for public release.,,no,IRB approval received; see nsass.org and DOI:10.31235/osf.io/mv76p for research design and analysis plan details.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/citation/,tfmp3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602c794a38d71900b1744efa/,602c794a38d71900b1744efa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfmp3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tfmp3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tfmp3,NA

This paper presents the results of a systematic review that finds a schism in the literature showing theoretical and empirical treatment of project delivery risk polarises into considering either the effect of complexity or the inside view; rarely are they considered jointly.  This work discusses the implications for theory and practice and identifies Case Based Decision Theory and Bayesian modelling, both of which are outside view techniques, as having potential to reconcile complexity and the inside view and thus provide for their joint treatment.",TRUE,FALSE,artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence and project management|artificial intelligence for project management|bayesian modelling|bayesian modelling for project management|case based decision theory|case based reasoning|case based reasoning for project management|complexity|inside view|machine learning and project management|machine learning for project management|major programme|major project|root cause,2021-02-19T05:15:41.919850,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:15:19.819488,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/citation/,j9sw8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c4wum/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/relationships/node/,c4wum,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602c66cbb78d1800a3527b9b/,602c66cbb78d1800a3527b9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9sw8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9sw8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9sw8,https://doi.org/10.25219/epoj.2021.00104

To determine the difference in the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths between Muslim-majority and non-Muslim countries, and investigate reasons for the disparities. All Muslim-majority countries are considered partly or completely not free (in war), and 80% are LMICs (low- and middle-income countries). 
Methods
The 50 Muslim-majority countries have more than 50.0% Muslims with an average of 87.5% Muslims. The non-Muslim country sample consisted of 50 countries with highest GDP while omitting any Muslim-majority countries listed. Their average percentage of Muslims was 4.7%. All data was pulled on September 18, 2020. To measure incidence of COVID-19, three different Average Treatment Methods (ATE) were used to validate the results. 
Results
Non-Muslim countries had significantly more COVID-19 cases, 3-times that of Muslim-majority countries. Non-Muslim countries had 1.86-times more COVID-19 deaths than Muslim-majority countries. These percentages were obtained by applying the simulation method to ATE’s results.
Conclusion
Despite most Muslim-majority countries being poor and all considered partly or completely unfree, 34/50 (68%) countries had shown a decline in active COVID-19 cases. This study shows that Muslims’ practice of tahara (purity or cleanliness) is similar to many COVID-19 containment measures and tawakkul (trust in Allah) helps them remain resilient and hopeful during difficult unpredictable times, such as living through a pandemic. Developed countries can benefit from the knowledge learned in this study. Research should be conducted with Muslims in Muslim-majority and non-Muslim countries to further study the health benefits of adhering to Islamic practices, principles, and beliefs.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|COVID-19 cases|COVID-19 deaths|Muslim countries|Muslims|non-Muslim countries,2021-02-17T14:47:06.773431,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-17T14:44:15.367562,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14034938.v2,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/citation/,84zq5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602bf505e38cb700658a557d/,602bf505e38cb700658a557d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84zq5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/84zq5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/84zq5,NA

We conducted a field experiment to study two technologies that allow teachers to outsource grading and feedback tasks on writing practices of high school seniors. The first technology is a fully automated evaluation system that provides instantaneous scores and feedback. The second one uses human graders as an additional resource to enhance grading and feedback quality in aspects in which the automated system arguably falls short. Both technologies significantly improved students' essay scores in a large college admission exam, and the addition of human graders did not improve effectiveness in spite of increasing perceived feedback quality. Both technologies also similarly helped teachers engage more frequently on personal discussions on essay quality with their students. Taken together, these results indicate that teachers' task composition shifted toward nonroutine activities and this helped circumvent some of the limitations of artificial intelligence. More generally, our results illustrate how the most recent wave of technological change may relocate labor to analytical and interactive tasks that still remain a challenge to automation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-17T14:44:42.128673,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-17T14:42:29.952908,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3729,prereg_both,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Bruno Ferman|Lycia Lima|and Flávio Riva,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/citation/,qw249,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602bcf2338d719006674552a/,602bcf2338d719006674552a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qw249/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qw249/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qw249,NA
