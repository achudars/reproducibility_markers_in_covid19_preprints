Internet backbone providers, online marketplaces, and search engines -
process hundreds of millions of data transfers every day, and host or link
to literally tens of billions of items of third party content.

Some of this content is illegal. In the last 12 years, both Congress and
the courts have concluded that Internet intermediaries should not be liable
for a wide range of content posted or sent through their systems by
another. The reasoning behind these immunities is impeccable: if Internet
intermediaries were liable every time someone posted problematic content on
the Internet, the resulting threat of liability and effort at rights
clearance would debilitate the Internet.

While the logic of some sort of safe harbor for Internet intermediaries is
clear, the actual content of those safe harbors is not. Rather, the safe
harbors actually in place are a confusing and illogical patchwork. For some
claims, the safe harbors are absolute. For others, they preclude damages
liability but not injunctive relief. For still others they are dependent on
the implementation of a ""notice and takedown"" system. And for at least a
few types of claims, there is no safe harbor at all. This patchwork makes
no sense. In this article, I suggest that it be replaced with a uniform
safe harbor rule. A single, rationally designed safe harbor based on the
trademark model would not only permit plaintiffs the relief they need while
protecting Internet intermediaries from unreasonable liability, but would
also serve as a much needed model for the rest of the world, which has yet
to understand the importance of intermediaries to a vibrant Internet.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:04.889052,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:28:30.082000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/citation/,eshq7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xfzbu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/relationships/node/,xfzbu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcce0fb83f6901f1655ec7/,57bcce0fb83f6901f1655ec7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eshq7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eshq7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eshq7

leads me to write a paper with such a provocative title. The first
development is the rise of hold-up as a primary component of patent
litigation and patent licensing. The second development in the last three
decades is the massive surge in university patenting. At the confluence of
these developments is a growing frustration on the part of industry with
the role of universities as patent owners. Time and again, when I talk to
people in a variety of industries, their view is that universities are the
new patent trolls.

In this paper, I argue that Universities should take a broader view of
their role in technology transfer. University technology transfer ought to
have as its goal maximizing the social impact of technology, not merely
maximizing the university's licensing revenue. Sometimes those goals will
coincide with the university's short-term financial interests. Sometimes
universities will maximize the impact of an invention on society by
granting exclusive licenses for substantial revenue to a company that will
take the invention and commercialize it. Sometimes, but not always. At
other times a non-exclusive license, particularly on a basic enabling
technology, will ultimately maximize the invention's impact on society by
allowing a large number of people to commercialize in different areas, to
try out different things and see if they work, and the like. University
policies might be made more nuanced than simply a choice between exclusive
and nonexclusive licenses. For example, they might grant field-specific
exclusivity, or exclusivity only for a limited term, or exclusivity only
for commercial sales while exempting research, and they might condition
continued exclusivity on achievement of certain dissemination goals.
Finally, particularly in the software context, there are many circumstances
in which the social impact of technology transfer is maximized either by
the university not patenting at all or by granting licenses to those
patents on a royalty-free basis to all comers.

Finally, I think we can learn something about the raging debate over who's
a patent troll and what to do about trolls by looking at university
patents. Universities are non-practicing entities. They share some
characteristics with trolls, at least if the term is broadly defined, but
they are not trolls. Asking what distinguishes universities from trolls can
actually help us figure out what concerns us about trolls. What we ought to
do is abandon the search for a group of individual companies to define as
trolls. In my view, troll is as troll does. Universities will sometimes be
bad actors. Nonmanufacturing patent owners will sometimes be bad actors.
Manufacturing patent owners will sometimes be bad actors. Instead of
singling out bad actors, we should focus on the bad acts and the laws that
make them possible.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:06.179873,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:25:01.856000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/citation/,ze7qv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fuh4x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/relationships/node/,fuh4x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bccd3f6c613b01efd93269/,57bccd3f6c613b01efd93269,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7qv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ze7qv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ze7qv

prices at which anyone else sold a share of stock. If you wanted to buy (or
sell) a share of stock, you'd have to guess what it was worth. The result,
everyone would agree, would be massively inefficient. Willing buyers and
sellers would often miss each other. Patents, however, exist in just such a
blind market. Want to know if you're getting a good deal on a patent
license, or acquiring rights in a technology? Too bad. Even if that patent
or ones like it have been licensed dozens of times before, the terms of
those licenses, including the price itself, will almost invariably be
confidential. Patent owners who want to put their rights up for sale face
the same problem.

The result? Willing licensors and licensees can't find each other. Patent
auctions often fizzle, because without a thick market - one with an array
of buyers and sellers bidding on price - no one can know whether they are
getting a steal or being had. When parties do license patents, the prices
are (to the extent we can tell) all over the map. And the rest of the world
has no idea what those prices are. This in turn means that courts lack
adequate benchmarks to determine a ¿reasonable royalty¿ when companies
infringe patents.

The solution is straightforward: require publication of patent assignment
and license terms. Doing so won't magically make the market for patents
work like a stock exchange; there will still be significant uncertainty
about whether a patent is valid and what it covers. But it will permit the
aggregate record of what companies pay for rights to signal what particular
patents are worth and how strong they are, just as derivative financial
instruments allow markets to evaluate and price other forms of risk. It
will help rationalize patent transactions, turning them from secret,
one-off negotiations into a real, working market for patents. And by making
it clear to courts and the world at large what the normal price is for
patent rights, it will make it that much harder for a few unscrupulous
patent owners to hold up legitimate innovators, and for established
companies to systematically infringe the rights of others.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:26.766705,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:23:06.641000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/citation/,c286x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/djm3z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/relationships/node/,djm3z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcccce6c613b01ead93303/,57bcccce6c613b01ead93303,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c286x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c286x

infringement of patents in a wide variety of technologies. With a very few
exceptions, the statute does not distinguish between different technologies
in setting and applying legal standards. In theory, then, we have a unified
patent system that provides technology-neutral protection to all kinds of
technologies.

Of late, however, we have noticed an increasing divergence between the
rules themselves and the application of the rules to different industries.
The best examples are biotechnology and computer software. In biotechnology
cases, the Federal Circuit has bent over backwards to find biotechnological
inventions nonobvious, even if the prior art demonstrates a clear plan for
producing the invention. On the other hand, the court has imposed stringent
enablement and written description requirements on biotechnology patents
that do not show up in other disciplines. In computer software cases, the
situation is reversed. The Federal Circuit has essentially excused software
inventions from compliance with the enablement and best mode requirements,
but has done so in a way that raises serious questions about how
stringently it will read the nonobviousness requirements. As a practical
matter, it appears that while patent law is technology-neutral in theory,
it is technology-specific in application.

The paper explains how the application of the same general legal standards
can lead to such different results in diverse industries. Much of the
variance in patent standards is attributable to the use of a legal
construct, the ""person having ordinary skill in the art"" (PHOSITA), to
determine obviousness and enablement. The more skill those in the art have,
the less information an applicant has to disclose in order to meet the
enablement requirement - but the harder it is to meet the nonobviousness
requirement. The level of skill in the art affects not just patent
validity, but also patent scope.

We do not challenge the idea that the standards in each industry should
vary with the level of skill in that industry. We think the use of the
PHOSITA provides needed flexibility for patent law, permitting it to adapt
to new technologies without losing its essential character. We fear,
however, that the Federal Circuit has not applied that standard properly in
either the biotechnology or computer software fields. The court has a
perception of both fields that was set in earlier cases but which does not
reflect the modern realities of either industry. The changes in an industry
over time present significant structural problems for patent law, both
because law is necessarily backward-looking and precedent-bound and because
applying different standards to similar inventions raises concerns about
horizontal equity. Nonetheless, we believe the courts must take more care
than they currently do to ensure that their assessments of patent validity
are rooted in understandings of the technology that were accurate at the
time the invention was made.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:06.757685,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:18:32.706000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/citation/,26zn4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vgw4a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/relationships/node/,vgw4a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bccbbf9ad5a101f468d449/,57bccbbf9ad5a101f468d449,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26zn4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26zn4

mean and how and where to enforce them. We propose a simple, practical set
of rules regarding patents that SSOs can adopt to achieve the goals of
FRAND commitments far more efficiently with far less litigation. Under our
proposed approach, if an standard-essential patent owner and an implementer
of the standard cannot agree on licensing terms, the standard-essential
patent owner is obligated to enter into binding baseball-style (or “final
offer”) arbitration with any willing licensee to determine the royalty
rate. This obligation may be conditioned on the implementer making a
reciprocal FRAND Commitment for any standard-essential patents it owns that
read on the same standard. If the implementer is unwilling to enter into
binding arbitration, the standard-essential patent owner’s FRAND commitment
not to go to court to enforce its standard-essential patents against that
party is discharged. We explain how our proposed FRAND regime would work in

license demands actually led to innovation or technology transfer. We find
that very few patent license demands actually lead to new innovation; most
simply involve payment for the freedom to keep doing what the licensee was
already doing. Surprisingly, this is true not only of NPE licenses but even
of licenses from product-producing companies and universities. Our results
cast significant doubt on one common justification for patent trolls.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:05.346487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:14:46.377000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/citation/,rfh6n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ywybm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/relationships/node/,ywybm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bccad8594d9001fad0daa0/,57bccad8594d9001fad0daa0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfh6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rfh6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rfh6n

patent litigation. In this Article, we update and expand the earlier study
with a new hand-coded data set. We evaluate all substantive decisions
rendered by any court in every patent case filed in 2008 and 2009 —
decisions made between 2009 and 2013. We consider not just patent validity
but also infringement and unenforceability. Moreover, we relate the
outcomes of those cases to a host of variables, including variables related
to the parties, the patents, and the courts in which those cases were
litigated. The result is a comprehensive picture of the outcomes of modern
patent litigation, one that confirms conventional wisdom in some respects
but upends it in others. In particular, we find a surprising amount of
continuity in the basic outcomes of patent lawsuits over the past twenty
years, despite rather dramatic changes in who brought patent suits during
that time.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:37.038065,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:13:35.945000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/citation/,ascgv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zejsc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/relationships/node/,zejsc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcca92b83f6901f8655ef9/,57bcca92b83f6901f8655ef9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ascgv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ascgv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ascgv
