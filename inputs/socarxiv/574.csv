Operating through an incentive-based approach, the SLCP involved 32 million rural households as the core agents for program implementation. In this paper, we aim to fill a research gap regarding the condition for environmental effectiveness at the household level. In particular, we analyzed how institutional and socio-economic conditions influence rural households to reach the primary environmental goals. Based on a broad literature review, we analyzed relevant conditions based on 59 interviews with SLCP participants at the household level to combine these data with field-observed evaluation of the environmental effects on enrolled plots. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), our results show that the pathway to environmental success or failure at the household level has been shaped by local institutional and socio-economic conditions in a combinatory manner. As the key components of successful pathways, the combination of household involvement and effective monitoring plays a fundamental role.

Using a sample of published qualitative, article-length studies on the Rwandan and Yugoslav wars, we find a lack of reflexivity over causal claims in scholarship on conflict. Causal language is not as pervasive as expected, asserted cause-effect relationships are rarely fully explicated, and scholars under-explore their causal assumptions. Considering that ideas on causation necessarily condition explanations of conflict, including “ethnic” conflict, this is a major research issue. While there exists a lively debate between different causal narratives regarding the onset of conflict—with studies alternatively stressing “attitudes,” “conditions,” or both—it stops short of addressing issues at the deeper level of causal understandings. For the most part, studies subscribe to the search for empirical generalization, thus limiting attendant debates to a single model of causation. These findings indicate that conflict studies literature would benefit from greater reflexivity and pluralism with regards to causation, and paying more attention to philosophical debates on the subject.

Evidence from the Australian ‘Clean Energy Future’ policy, July 2012 to June 2014","Aviation emissions are an important contributor to global climatic change. As growth in travel demand continues to outstrip improvements in the fuel efficiency of air travel, the aviation contribution to climate change is likely to grow substantially. Consequently, measures that effectively reduce travel demand are required if atmospheric carbon concentrations are to be limited. The efficacy of the Australian Clean Energy Future policy which placed a $23.00AUD (FY 2012) to $24.15 AUD (FY 2013) per tonne levy on carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions from July 2012 to June 2014 is tested. Specifically, time-series regression is used to estimate the effect of this carbon price policy on the level of domestic passenger kilometres flown in Australia, while adjusting for costs of production (i.e. fuel and labour costs), economic activity (i.e. gross domestic product), competitive effects (i.e. airline capacity), and exogenous shocks. There was no evidence that the carbon price reduced the level of domestic aviation in Australia.

Yet, current debates lament deficiencies in a clear analytical focus and a profound theoretical conceptualization. In this article, we therefore strive for more analytical and theoretical clarity, first, by suggesting an analytical differentiation of value, values, value attribution, and value assessment as the objects of study within this research field. Second, we propose a theoretical conceptualization of valuation as emotional value attribution and evaluation as comparative value assessment. Assuming that value is nothing objectively given, we highlight the role of emotions for answering the question how value attribution relates to the comparative value assessment of persons, practices, ideas, and objects.",TRUE,FALSE,emotions|sociology of valuation and evaluation|value assessment|value attribution,2018-07-02T11:57:47.467398,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-26T16:18:23.134595,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/citation/,huwk3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ex35v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/relationships/node/,ex35v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b324980daf8210012dafdfc/,5b324980daf8210012dafdfc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/huwk3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/huwk3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/huwk3,NA

Traditional approaches to the study of social movements focus only on the life of the movement, from emergence to decline. Instead, I conduct a historical, comparative analysis on the pre-movement activities of evangelical Christian communities in these two countries from 1925-1975. Employing insights from historical institutionalism, I identify two critical junctures in the historical development of evangelical communities that suppressed the entrepreneurship and institution-building activities of Canadian evangelicals relative to those in the United States. I find that these divergences in institution building affected the size and strength of the institutional infrastructures—supportive organizations, networks, and resources—of the religious right movements in these countries. I argue that historical, comparative analysis in general, and historical institutionalism in particular, is useful to social movement scholarship's understanding of cross-national movement comparisons.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|comparative politics|comparative sociology|evangelical|historical institutionalism|political sociology|religious right|right-wing movements|social movements,2018-07-02T11:57:46.517648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-26T10:08:50.778036,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/citation/,z324u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3jzq2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/relationships/node/,3jzq2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b314d73daf8210011d70a6b/,5b314d73daf8210011d70a6b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z324u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z324u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z324u,https://doi.org/10.17813/1086-671X-24-1-95
