Forecasting how life expectancy will develop in the future is essential for society. Most forecasts rely on a mechanical extrapolation of past mortality trends, which leads to inaccurate outcomes because of temporal fluctuations in the past trends due to lifestyle “epidemics”. We project life expectancy for 18 European countries by taking into account the impact of smoking, obesity, and alcohol on mortality, and the mortality experiences of forerunner populations. We project that life expectancy will increase from, on average, 83.4 years for women and 78.3 years for men in 2014 to 92.8 years for women and 90.5 years for men in 2065. Compared to others (Lee-Carter, Eurostat, United Nations), we project higher future life expectancy values and more realistic differences between countries and sexes.

Virtual museums make important contributions to bringing the works of art in museums to the classroom environment and making the lesson more concrete and understandable. Especially considering the exhibition of the past, virtual museums could be used for history courses but more research needs to be done on the subject. This study aimed at exploring pre-service history teachers’ opinions and experiences about virtual museum applications.

On one hand, digital information is readily available nowadays, which in turn makes the hardwiring of knowledge less significant and shifts the focus towards competency development. In a digitalized world where information is easily accessible, it is argued that students in higher education need to develop more sensible soft skills that allow them to systematically and critically analyze information. Whilst knowledge can be acquired in a relatively short period, competency development requires more active repetition and patience. Thus, applying relevant and supportive teaching methods is seen as essential. Quantitative data was collected from the participants (n=107) and examined through descriptive analysis. The results of the research revealed that students in higher education generally had a positive perception of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) and considered themselves proficient with the usage of ICT in the classroom.

Private higher education institutions in India collaborate with foreign education providers to deliver education services in variety of modes for enlarging the student share in the market. Applying Porter’s Five Force Model it was analysed how the institutions in NCR of India position themselves in the market forces and strategise to get comparative advantage. India with huge size of middle class and vast system of higher education always attract the foreign institutions to collaborate and expand. The restrictive and proscriptive regulation does not allow foreign qualification in India except twinning mode. The finding of the present analysis using porter’s five force model suggest that regulation of the state must be comprehensive and supportive to encash the flow of market innovations that happen to be.

This culture, it is thought, is institutionalized in contemporary employment practices such that, as in human capital theory, self-entrepreneurialism is widespread among employees, and the more self-entrepreneurial earn more. I contribute a quantitative and comprehensive response to these largely untested claims using survey data from the mid-1990s through mid-2010s, representative of working-age Americans. I find individuals’ self-mastery, self-directedness, focus on self-growth and self-foresight of their future forms one general latent reflective self-concept. As a subjectivity, this self-entrepreneurialism is not associated with self-sufficiency or self-flexibility but is high among Americans regardless of social group. In terms of objective earnings, I find self-entrepreneurialism to be associated with an average earnings premium of up to ten percent of average earnings within occupations. However, self-entrepreneurialism does almost nothing to account for enduring earnings inequality between occupations.

We explore intermediary financing constraints, a channel studied in the banking literature, but only implicitly addressed in the venture capital (VC) literature. Our empirical setting is the VC fundraising and startup financing environment around the passage of the Volcker Rule, which restricted banks' ability to invest in venture capital funds as limited partners (LPs). The rule change disproportionately impacted regions of the U.S. historically lacking in VC financing. We find that a one standard deviation increase in VCs' exposure to the loss of banks as LPs led to an 18% decline in fund size and about a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow-on fund. Startups were not completely cushioned from the additional constraints on their VCs: capital raised fell and pre-money valuations declined. Overall, VC financing constraints manifest as fewer, smaller funds that change investment strategy and ex- perience increases in bargaining power. Last, we show that the rule change increased the likelihood startups moved out of impacted states, thus exacerbating the geographic disparity in high-growth entrepreneurship.",TRUE,FALSE,agglomeration|banking|entrepreneurship|financial constraints|financial intermediation|regulation|venture capital,2021-04-12T02:57:12.171738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-12T02:56:33.408933,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/michaelewens/Banks-In-VC,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/citation/,8tpux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/syqbm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/relationships/node/,syqbm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607362fc51f7ae0483f50a1b/,607362fc51f7ae0483f50a1b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tpux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8tpux/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8tpux,NA

Hedonic and eudaimonic conceptions of subjectively experienced wellbeing cannot be taken as universally applicable or always the best ways to think about wellbeing in connection with transport and travel behaviour. Those conceptions have a role to play in research and policy, but the effects generated by the pursuit of those versions of wellbeing should be critically considered. This is particularly important when that pursuit encourages selfish behaviour or research considers people and communities whose beliefs and worldviews are incommensurate with the assumptions of universal emotions, a priori and innate needs, or the individual as fully detached from their social and cultural context. Transport research and planning can benefit significantly from greater engagement with relational and process-oriented understandings of wellbeing and its association with human actions, including different ways of moving around the city. The contours of one such approach, which revolves around a reworked notion of capabilities, are sketched, but experimentation with alternatives is much desired.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-12T02:56:03.511102,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-12T02:55:49.485944,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Tim Schwanen,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/citation/,29ct7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nceuv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/relationships/node/,nceuv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6072fdc3f6585f047d614d2c/,6072fdc3f6585f047d614d2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ct7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/29ct7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/29ct7,NA
