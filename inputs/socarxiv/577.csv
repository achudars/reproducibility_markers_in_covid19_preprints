It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy. We found that rates of inconsistencies in x-phi are lower than in the psychological and behavioral sciences. From the point of view of statistical reporting consistency, x-phi seems to do no worse, and perhaps even better, than psychological science.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral science|experimental philosophy|p-values|statcheck|statistical inconsistencies|statistical methodology,2018-07-02T11:24:26.092872,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-17T14:36:45.333816,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,Matteo Colombo|Georgi Duev|Michèle B.

The housing increase and 2007 Mortgage Law could have reduced housing differences between middle-income and affluent households, but the rise in gated communities could have increased these differences. Using data from Turkey’s 2012 Household and Budget Survey, we find that middle-income households are significantly less likely than affluent households to own their homes and live in larger homes, and among owner-occupiers, in homes of higher value. Less pronounced differences are found in their residence in newer homes. Fewer differences in housing outcomes exist between middle- and lower-income households, particularly among owner-occupiers. These results suggest that the most affluent households, rather than the poorest households, are likely isolating themselves from other households, thereby affecting the future well-being of middle-income households.",TRUE,FALSE,Housing|Middle-class|Stratification|Turkey,2018-07-02T11:22:50.741508,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-17T13:00:35.675566,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/citation/,5496f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a0e6bb69ad5a1026e0c30c4/,5a0e6bb69ad5a1026e0c30c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5496f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5496f/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5496f

We pooled data from the 2004, 2006, and 2008 waves of the Public Health Management Corporation’s Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Survey.  These data contain respondents’ religious identities and are geocoded at the census-tract level, allowing us to merge American Community Survey data and examine neighborhood-level outcomes to gauge respondents’ locational attainment.  Net of controls, our multivariate analyses reveal that among blacks and nonblacks, Muslims live in neighborhoods that have significantly lower shares of whites and greater representations of blacks.  Among blacks, Muslims are significantly less likely to reside in suburbs, relative to non-Muslims.  The Muslim disadvantages for blacks and nonblacks in neighborhood poverty and neighborhood median income, however, become insignificant.

From the observed variable of average income image, the latent income distribution images from which the observed average income image is supposed to be derived were estimated and differences in income distribution image by social position were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical models.
In the analysis, differences in income distribution image by age cohort and household income class were examined in terms of the mean and the Gini inequality coefficient of the distribution image.

This paper presents an exploratory analysis that reveals divergent and convergent themes across the initiatives to inform similar initiatives in the future. The SPUR initiative was the inspiration for both RWS and ORP. As such, an evolution of ideas is evident from the first initiative to the most recent. While the SPUR initiative was a model for the RWS and ORP initiatives, the process and outcomes of the latter two initiatives were more similar than to the original SPUR initiative. Major examples of this are the smaller scopes, as well as increased prominence and continued innovation of recovery-based performance measurement frameworks to help identify seismic resilience recommendations. The importance of this innovation is not clear, however, based on the small amount of explicit integration with the respective initiative definitions of resilience, goals and recommendations. More systematic research into elements of the SPUR, RWS, and ORP initiatives, such as development of the performance measurement frameworks, is warranted given the initiatives’ popularity and influence on the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Community Resilience Planning Guide. The paper concludes by situating the NIST guide in the context of the three seismic resilience planning initiatives.",TRUE,FALSE,Disasters|Earthquake|Hazards|Mitigation|Planning|Recovery|Resilience,2018-07-02T11:22:47.987586,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-15T02:46:54.846776,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/citation/,ba6r4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4gcp8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/relationships/node/,4gcp8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a0b96e59ad5a1026e0b1fdd/,5a0b96e59ad5a1026e0b1fdd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba6r4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ba6r4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ba6r4

This article hones in on the use of assessment regimes at the level of the European Union, particularly in the work of the Commission, to argue for a missing middle between technology assessment and impact assessment. Technology assessment focuses on the upstream governance of science and technology, while impact assessment focuses on the downstream governance of the impacts of specific policy options. What is missing is a form of midstream governance, which I label innovation assessment, to steer polities through periods of disruptive technological change, during which innovations have taken concrete forms and are beginning to diffuse, but still exhibit much scope for rapid, unexpected change and alternative trajectories of development. By juxtaposing these three forms of assessment regimes, I define the main dimensions along which they vary.",TRUE,FALSE,disruptive innovation|governance|impact assessment|innovation assessment|policy appraisal|technology assessment,2018-07-02T11:22:47.522776,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-14T13:32:18.112160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",Jacob Adam Hasselbalch,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/citation/,3rj94,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/crn2j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/relationships/node/,crn2j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a0aefd9594d90026ac0671d/,5a0aefd9594d90026ac0671d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rj94/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3rj94/,https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2017.1363805,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3rj94

Disruptive innovations overturn expectations about how markets function and develop, and they often raise moral, legal and scientific concerns among professionals. Sudden technological changes can result in a state of professional disruption, in which technological change challenges the institutional arrangements of a profession. This article distinguishes between fast and slow processes of professional change, focusing on the role of technology as one cause of fast changes to a profession. Professionals and non-professionals engage in framing contests that draw on cognitive, normative and relational keys to signal their expectations. It is in these framing contests that professionals run the risk of disruption. Drawing on interview data with key policy actors, I investigate electronic cigarettes regulation in the European Union and its recent revision to the Tobacco Products Directive. Medical and public health professionals that control tobacco issues were challenged by a coalition of e-cigarette industry representatives, e-cigarette users, and liberal politicians. The challengers drew on the contending norm of harm reduction in tobacco control, which successfully challenged the centrality of the abstinence norm in the institutional arrangements of the medical and public health professions and their organizational field. By discussing the parallels to other related cases in health regulation, I draw out the implications of the study for researchers and policymakers.",TRUE,FALSE,electronic cigarettes|health regulation|institutional work|organizational fields|professional disruption|technology,2018-07-02T11:22:47.487141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-14T13:25:59.988526,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Jacob Adam Hasselbalch,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/citation/,9ew3m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vdj4b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/relationships/node/,vdj4b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a0aedc49ad5a1026d0ad959/,5a0aedc49ad5a1026d0ad959,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ew3m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ew3m/,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpo/jov009,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ew3m
