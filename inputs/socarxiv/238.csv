This chapter traces how symbol systems and social structures have been theorized independently of each other in the social sciences during the 20th century, before elaborating the ways in which sociologists have theorized the relationship between the two. Marx, Weber, and Simmel offered important ideas about this relationship, but Durkheim’s account of the social origins of mental structures provides the most direct and elaborated theory about the relationship between mental and social structures within the classical sociological period. Subsequently, we trace Durkheim’s legacy through three contemporary perspectives: field theory, neo-institutionalism, and culture and cognition. While maintaining analytical continuity with the Durkheimian tradition, these perspectives also represent new theoretical, analytical, and methodological advances in locating and specifying correspondences between symbol systems and social structures. Nevertheless, we find that pressing questions remain pertaining to how symbol systems and social structures interrelate, and how exactly this relationship shapes both cognition and action.",TRUE,FALSE,cognition|culture|fields|organizations|social structures|symbol systems,2020-06-25T07:26:55.191916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-25T07:26:15.949150,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,None,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/citation/,v4wc8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef37eda145b1a02d952e6ac/,5ef37eda145b1a02d952e6ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4wc8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v4wc8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v4wc8,NA

Over the same period, the correlation of labor income within couples has also increased sharply. Is this increase in sorting over labor income a cause for the rise of labor income inequality among couples? Using the March supplement of the CPS, first, I find that there has been a sharp increase in positive sorting over labor income in the U.S. in the 1970-2018 period. The top decile of men’s earners married to the top decile of women’s earners has doubled from 10.6 percent in 1970 to 23.3 percent in 2018. Second, I use a bounded copula framework as a reference distribution to track the relative changes in labor income inequality among couples. Using this framework, I find that positive sorting over labor income did play a role in increasing labor income inequality among couples in the 1970-1990 period; however, I find little evidence to suggest that this relationship existed in the 1990-2018 period.

Implementing the SDGs requires connected actions across local, national, regional, and global levels; thus, target-seeking scenarios need to reflect alternative options and tensions across those scales. We argue that the design of global sustainability-oriented target-seeking scenarios requires a consistent process for capturing multiple and contrasting perspectives on how to reach the goals, including the perspectives from multiple scales (e.g. local, national, regional) and geographic regions (e.g. the Global South). Here we propose a novel approach to co-design global target-seeking scenarios, consisting of (a) capturing global perspectives on pathways to the SDGs through a review of existing global scenarios; (b) a multi-stakeholder process to obtain multiple sub-global perspectives on pathways to sustainability; (c) an analysis of convergences, and crucially, divergences between global and regional perspectives on pathways to reach the SDGs, feeding into the design of new target-seeking scenario narratives. As a case study, we use the results of the 2018 African Dialogue on The World in 2050, discussing the future of agriculture and food systems. The identified divergent themes emerging from our analysis included urbanization, population growth, agricultural practices, and the roles of different actors in the future of agriculture. The results challenge some of the existing underlying assumptions of the current sustainability-oriented global scenarios (e.g. population growth, urbanisation, agricultural practices), indicating the relevance and timeliness of the proposed approach. We suggest that similar approaches can be replicated in other contexts to better inform the process of sustainability-oriented scenario co-design across scales, regions and cultures.",TRUE,FALSE,cross-scale analysis|food system transformation|pathways|Sustainable Development Goals|target-seeking scenarios|Three Horizons,2020-06-24T18:42:21.779660,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24T18:42:08.921681,FALSE,NA,no,Please get in touch with authors to get access.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/citation/,pa3bc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef30e6676ebd80293cdf977/,5ef30e6676ebd80293cdf977,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pa3bc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pa3bc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pa3bc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102198

This study asks how cohort trends in parity-specific fertility differ across educational
segments for men and women, and what role multi-partner fertility plays in these trends. The
study used Finnish and Swedish register data on cohorts born in 1940–1973/1978. The main
analyses use parity progression ratios. Ordinary ratios were contrasted with ratios on births to
first reproductive partner. Among low- and medium-educated persons we observe parity
polarization, where both childlessness and higher parity (3+) births increase, largely
reflecting increases in multi-partner fertility. Highly educated men and women more often
have exactly two children. We demonstrate that cohort total fertility can mask significant
parity-specific trends across educational groups, and that changes in multi-partner fertility
can be a part and parcel of cohort trends in socioeconomic fertility differentials.",TRUE,FALSE,childlessness|cohort|education|Fertility|gender|multi-partner fertility|Nordic countries|parity|parity progression ratios|socioeconomic,2020-06-24T18:40:45.445932,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24T18:40:26.653861,FALSE,NA,no,Licenses to use data are granted by Stastistics Finland (www.stat.fi/index_en) and Statistics Sweden (www.scb.se/en/).,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Marika Jalovaara; Linus Andersson; Anneli Miettinen,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/citation/,sjdt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m6r8t/,m6r8t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef2fe8a145b1a02b052e44c/,5ef2fe8a145b1a02b052e44c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjdt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjdt6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sjdt6,NA

Using eight follow-up waves of the German Family Panel (Pairfam), with observations from 8,177 persons from three birth cohorts between 2009 and 2016, this study investigates whether meeting online is associated with relationship satisfaction, intention to separate, separation, moving in together, intentions to have a child, and entry into parenthood. More specifically, a series of between-person regressions are used to compare those who met their partners offline and those who met their partners online. Results show that meeting online is associated with likelihood to separate and intentions to have a child in the youngest birth cohort, and transition to parenthood in the oldest birth cohort.

Using data from a nationally representative sample of 958 respondents, we examine how political party, belief in patriotic displays in sport, attention to concussion news, social class, and race are associated with encouragement of children playing each of the five major U.S. sports: baseball, basketball, hockey, soccer, and football. Our findings suggest that unlike other sports, attitudes about youth participation in football are divided by views on patriotism in sport, age, race, education, and attention to concussion news. For many Americans, football is connected to participation in a civil religion, which celebrates national pride and respect for the military. We argue that child safety advocates who aim to steer children away from football must grapple with the deeper cultural and identity-based framework associated with the sport.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudinal research|children|inequality|patriotism|political sociology|sport,2020-06-24T09:29:00.976362,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24T09:28:48.352362,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be posted immediately after publication.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/citation/,xgscj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ncjfq/,ncjfq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef2875e145b1a028752f04f/,5ef2875e145b1a028752f04f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgscj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xgscj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xgscj,NA

One key step in strengthening adaptive capacity is understanding the relationship between farmers’ experience with natural hazards and their perceptions of climate change, and its role in farmers’ decision making around climate change adaptation. Here we explore Puerto Rican farmers’ psychological distance of climate change after experiencing category 4 Hurricane Maria, in order to intersect the roles of experience, perceptions, and motivation for farmers’ decision-making around climate change adaptation. Farmers throughout Puerto Rico were surveyed by Extension Services’ agents (n = 405, 87% response rate) in 2018, eight months after Hurricane Maria. A structural equation model was used to evaluate how reported experience with past events and direct damages by Hurricane Maria related to farmers’ psychological distance of climate change, and the association of these variables to farmers’ motivation to adapt to climate change. We found that farmers psychological distance of climate change is both near and far, since they show a broad awareness to climate change’s impacts both locally and globally in different dimensions (temporal, geographical, and social). Reported experience and direct damages by the hurricane were not linked to their psychological distance of climate change, and these did not relate to their motivation to adapt. These results suggest that using extreme events as a driver for climate belief and action may no longer be relevant, especially in a context where there is a high level of climate change belief and continued threat of extreme events.  Thus, broadening analysis beyond individual perceptions as drivers of climate adaptation to how structural dynamics are linked to adaptive capacity could provide better understanding. This study is among the first to study the role of climate change experience and perceptions on farmers’ climate change adaption after an extreme weather event in an island-archipelago setting.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptive capacity|natural hazards|psychological distance of climate change|small island developing states|structural equation model,2020-06-24T11:02:35.250738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24T11:01:59.383793,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/citation/,e27k4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef26b5f76ebd80279cd6464/,5ef26b5f76ebd80279cd6464,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e27k4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e27k4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e27k4,NA

However, the to extent to which these gender disparities and gender pay gaps vary across contexts has received less attention. Therefore, I analyze how regional gender ideologies predict gender pay gaps in two ways: As directly affecting gender pay gaps and as indirectly predicting gender pay gaps through intermediate gender disparities in wage-determinants. The analyses are based on German survey data (SOEP 2014-2018) supplemented with regional-level statistics. 
First, I leverage regional differences in predictors of gender ideologies to estimate region-specific gender ideologies. Mapping these gender ideologies across Germany reveals substantial regional variation, which exceeds the known difference between East and Western Germany. Second, multi-level models provide region-specific gender disparities in wage-determinants and gender pay gaps. They show that in regions where traditional gender ideologies are wide-spread, women have less labor market experience and are less likely to work full-time or in supervising positions. Traditional gender ideologies thereby indirectly contribute to a higher gender pay gap by inducing gender disparities in labor market outcomes.
Even after accounting for such disparities in wage-determinants, a considerable gender pay gap persists in regions with relatively more traditional gender ideologies. This points to a direct effect of gender ideologies on adjusted gender pay gaps which might base on gender ideologies inducing women’s pay discrimination or gender-divergent wage expectations and negotiations.",TRUE,FALSE,gender ideologies|gender pay gap|multilevel models|regional variation|small area estimation,2020-06-24T09:30:40.568863,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24T09:30:21.516488,FALSE,NA,no,"The study is based on the German Socio-Economic Panel, which is subject to the high standards for lawful data protection in the Federal Republic of Germany.
