Yet, estimating the consequences of prenatal stress on children’s outcomes is complicated by the issue of confounding (i.e., unobserved factors correlated with stress exposure and with children’s outcomes). I combine a natural experiment—a strong earthquake in Chile—with a panel survey to capture the effect of prenatal exposure on acute stress and children’s cognitive ability. I find that
stress exposure in early pregnancy has no effect on children’s cognition among middle-class families, but it has a strong negative influence among poor families. I then examine possible pathways accounting for the socioeconomic stratification in the
effect of stress, including differential exposure across socioeconomic status, differential sensitivity, and parental responses.

The law, ostensibly race-neutral, wound up targeting almost all of Michigan’s cities with significant black population. The law ultimately disenfranchised half the state’s black population but only two percent of whites, as well as the majority of local black officials. This law invalidates a basic civil right and prerequisite for urban political theory: electoral democracy. Who holds power in the urban regime when the state takes over?
Drawing on 44 interviews, observations and archival research, I argue that a white urban regime governs without elected representation in this majority-black city. Emergency management, which shut out black officials, allowed this white urban regime to consolidate its influence, showing the deeper disenfranchisement inherent to this law. While posited as restoring “order” to troubled management, the process of emergency management in fact prolongs political crisis. But the ideological framing of emergency management as “neutral,” and black politics as “corrupt” or “self-interested,” provides the logic to blame black governance for structural disinvestment and white-led extraction.

In full and partial democracies, citizens’ attitudes can influence national policy on accepting refugees. A growing literature suggests international institutions can influence citizens’ attitudes on foreign policy issues, but those studies are almost entirely confined to domestic human rights and U.S.-based respondents; none consider refugee policy. Using data from a survey experiment administered in September 2017 via face-to-face interviews with 1335 Turkish citizens, we investigate how international norms affect citizens’ willingness to accept refugees. Our findings are surprising: reminding people about the government’s responsibility under the Refugee Convention to accept refugees triggers a backfire effect, decreasing support for accepting them. This effect appears driven by respondents who support the nationalist-populist incumbent party and by lower-educated respondents. We therefore provide evidence that international refugee law – and perhaps international institutions generally – can trigger a political backlash, undermining the very policies that they promote.",TRUE,FALSE,experiment|immigration|migration|refugees,2018-08-14T01:50:25.665689,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-14T01:50:06.088443,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,Kevin L Cope and Charles Crabtree,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/citation/,r5tnq,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ma9zu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/relationships/node/,ma9zu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b71e3503e03fb0016d5770a/,5b71e3503e03fb0016d5770a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5tnq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r5tnq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r5tnq

However, studying crime and place is often made more difficult by restrictions on access to appropriate crime data.

This article introduces the Crime Open Database (CODE), a database of 16 million offenses from 10 of the largest United States cities over 11 years and more than 60 offense types. Open crime data were obtained from each city, having been published in multiple incompatible formats. The data were processed to harmonize geographic co-ordinates, dates and times, offense categories and location types, as well as adding census and other geographic identifiers.

While the Alt Right has been around in some form since 2008, over the last year we have seen it grow from a small and insignificant white nationalist movement to a broad and seemingly growing street movement, able to unite and mobilise hundreds of far right protesters, both old and new to the movement.The question is, how has this happened? How have the Alt Right been able to go from insignificance
to such a potent movement so quickly?
In this paper I use a combination of Bourdieu’s field theory, and Hacking’s dynamic nominalism, to work towards a way of answering that question. Beginning with the neoliberal turn of the late 20th Century, I argue that the associated establishment of economic power above all else has opened the door for those with significant economic capital to transfer that into political power; that in doing so a crisis of political legitimacy has been created that throws the established order of political capital into question, and opens for door for new, more extreme, forms to gain power; and that the creation and legitimation of the Alt Right by media and political experts has created a new kind of political actor, that gives space on the far right for those who would not otherwise have been engaged.",NA,NA,Alt-Right|Bourdieu|Charlottesville|Far Right|Hacking|Neoliberalism,NA,2019-08-23T13:08:13.670354,,TRUE,withdrawn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,https://socopen.org/2019/05/26/socarxiv-policy-on-withdrawing-papers/,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/bibliographic_contributors/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/review_actions/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/py92t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/py92t/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/py92t

We provide a new perspective on campaigns by focusing on the strategic use of emotive language. We argue that the level of positive sentiment parties adopt in their campaigns depends on their incumbency status, their policy position, and objective economic conditions. We test these claims with a novel dataset that captures the emotive language used in over 400 party manifestos across eight European countries. As predicted, we find that incumbent parties, particularly incumbent prime ministerial parties, use more positive sentiment than opposition parties. We find that ideologically moderate parties employ higher levels of positive sentiment than extremist parties. And we find that all parties exhibit lower levels of positive sentiment when the economy is performing poorly but that this negative effect is weaker for incumbents. Our analysis has important implications for research on campaign strategies and retrospective economic voting.",TRUE,FALSE,campaign sentiment|electoral campaigns|electoral manifestos|party manifestos|political campaigns|sentiment analysis,2018-08-12T11:30:25.088442,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-12T11:29:57.282486,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,Charles Crabtree|Matt Golder|Thomas Gschwend|Indridi H.

Participation in a cult of personality is psychologically costly whenever it involves preference falsification, with the costs varying across individuals. Importantly, low psychological costs of preference falsification are correlated with traits the dictator values, such as unscrupulousness and ruthlessness, which we collectively term disposition-based competence. Under a wide variety of circumstances, this correlation makes participation in cults of personality informative from the dictator's point of view, allowing him to hire loyal and competent subordinates for the most important regime positions. In contrast to earlier formal work, our model implies that dictators can use cults of personality to avoid the loyalty-competence trade-off when promoting subordinates.",TRUE,FALSE,authoritarian regimes|cults of personality|dictator's dilemma|dictatorship|formal theory,2018-08-12T11:31:25.193523,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-12T11:31:06.320718,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,NA,Charles Crabtree|Holger L.
