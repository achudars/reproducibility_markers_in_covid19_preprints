However, the majority of viral messages are based on shocking or entertaining content. Is it possible to make other kinds of content go viral, such as science and technology news? I use conceptual blending analysis to analyze five representative, very small messages about solar technology that went viral (nanovirals).  I identify four distinct viral strategies that vary according to the number of belief systems used, and whether the viral message confirmed or contradicted central beliefs.  Finally, I use information systems modeling to depict a common viral mechanism underlying the strategies. I conclude with a practical heuristic to guide the design of nanoviral messages.

This paper determines the availability and accessibility of 3D printing technology in low-income communities through public libraries and gives insights on how libraries use 3D printers. By examining the 2013 Digital Inclusion Survey and conducting interviews, we found that libraries are quickly acquiring 3D printers; however, the technology is not being fully adopted by the patrons due to the lack of training, software and practical applications of the technology. Also, we found out that the cost to use a 3D printer in public libraries is relatively low, and does not prevent patrons from accessing the technology.

In this study we used data from a UK cohort to answer three related research questions. Is school enjoyment patterned by gender, socioeconomic background of cognitive ability? How well does school enjoyment explain later educational achievement? Does early school enjoyment at age 6 associate with social or gender differences in later educational achievement at age 16? Our results show that school enjoyment measured at age 6 is associated with gender and cognitive ability but not family socioeconomic background. For example, girls were twice as likely to report enjoying school than boys (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.56, 2.48). School enjoyment strongly associated with later achievement even after adjustment for socioeconomic background and cognitive ability; pupils who reported enjoying school scored on average 14.4 (95% CI: 6.9, 21.9) more points, equivalent to almost a 3-grade increase across all GCSE’s, and were 29% more likely to obtain 5+ A*-Cs including Maths and English (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.7) than those who did not enjoy school.

By drawing from the critical scholarship concerned with aphorisms, we demonstrate that some of the allure of the classical sociological texts derives from their form, and particularly their reliance on the relative autonomy of the aphorism. Through examining Marx’s “opiate of the people,” Weber’s “iron cage,” and, briefly, two more contemporary sociological aphorisms, we suggest that aphorisms have an ambivalent role in sociological theory: they make claims memorable even as they potentially oversimplify complex arguments.

An online quiz (http://bit.ly/2017ethics1) was also created and tested as an educational resource by administered the quiz twice to four years of medical students at Marian University.  The open access online quiz resource emails users personalized results comparing their last score to their prior attempts, against other quiz takers at their institution, and against an average of all quiz takers across institutions.  RESULTS: User demographics were analyzed and their knowledge of religions bioethical stances was determined to not be affected by age or sex, but was found to improve as they progressed through medical school.  There was greater variance between ethical questions than there was between quiz takers for each ethical issue, highlighting specific biomedical ethical issues that may benefit from increased educational time in curricula.  There also appeared to be differences based on the quiz takers religious background but the sample size for most backgrounds was too small to extrapolate the results to a wider population.

The experience of olfaction is highly emotion-laden and tightly bound to memory and personal history, and Western smell vocabularies are notoriously poor: scentful experience seems poorly suited as a basis to enroll others in political projects, especially in contexts that privilege rational public debate. But smells can also spur us to immediate action. When do they prompt us to enroll others in that action, and how do we turn individual sensory experiences into convincing arguments? How does olfaction leave the realm of individual experience and generate consequential social change? This article shows how social processes of olfaction can be used to prompt social action. With an analysis of the complaints that legitimated the 2015 destruction of a shanty town in southern Sweden and a historical inquiry into the shared beliefs that allowed those complaints to make sense, I show how olfactory claims – claims based on personal experiences of smell – can leverage broadly shared norms, values, and meanings to demand social action. Despite the personal, emotional, and fleeting nature of olfactory experience (or perhaps thanks to those features, which disallow independent confirmation) it can easily be weaponized as a political tool. This article asks how individual sensory experience can have social impact, and shows how a fit between local olfactory cosmologies and the particular features of olfactory claims can allow them to be used to demand action.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-09T21:32:45.642165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T21:32:18.281821,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/citation/,9vqzp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4cd4a822a88600194f5e57/,5d4cd4a822a88600194f5e57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vqzp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9vqzp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9vqzp

But an emphasis on knowledge displaces the complex issues faced by those teachers who identify – or are identified by others – as subject area experts. In this paper we use ethnographic observations and interviews to understand the professional project of art teachers in the United States. This data shows how the “in-between” nature of art teaching -- the teacher not quite an artist committed to their personal craft, nor a pedagogy-centered professional with well-defined objectives -- is a product of ongoing negotiations over the meaning of their work. When seen from relational perspective, in-betweenness is a practical outcome that at one point will color any professional project. In this sense, the troubled category of the art teacher helps illuminate central concerns in any study of teaching as a profession. Rather than deliver our own assessment of professionalization in the classroom, we use our data to illuminate three practical challenges faced by the art teacher. These include the negotiation of tasks that need doing, debates over the meaning and relevance of purity to the profession, and the maintenance of roles through an emergent understanding of expertise.

We find that ten years after the birth, father’s use of parental leave increases family income and makes wages more equal within the family.",TRUE,FALSE,Earnings inequality|Gender wage gap|Parental benefits|Parental leave|Paternity leave|Policy,2019-08-09T21:33:01.831851,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T21:32:49.580576,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,Youjin Choi|Anders Holm|Rachel Margolis,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/citation/,tx2vh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4cd31d265be200182f2b2c/,5d4cd31d265be200182f2b2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2vh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tx2vh/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tx2vh

I collect data on seigneurial jurisdictions for ancien-regime Spain and document a negative relationship between having been a seigneurial town in the 18th century and current economic development. To shed light on the causal effect, I focus on the distribution of lordships in the former Kingdom of Granada after its conquest by the Catholic Monarchs, which can be considered as conditionally random. The results confirm the negative effect of lordship found for the whole country: towns that shortly after the conquest were granted to nobles are relatively poorer today. In addition, I explore the mechanisms of persistence, with the results pointing to lower state capacity as a main explanatory factor. This finding is consistent with an interpretation of seigneurial jurisdictions as a privatization of the local government, which has historically hindered the application of central government policies and lowered the state’s infrastructural capacity in former manorial towns.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic development|Local political institutions|Lordships|State capacity,2019-08-09T21:35:43.413377,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T21:35:31.466481,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Daniel Oto-Peralías,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/citation/,k8mzr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gu79q/,gu79q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4c51d6272b140016eb97b7/,5d4c51d6272b140016eb97b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k8mzr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k8mzr

It presents a general analysis of the shortcomings of national legislation that limits the constitutional provisions for citizens of Ukraine to obtain the appropriate level of social protection. The article shows the problems of the status of internally
displaced persons (IDPs), which should provide for them additional guarantees from the state, including social ones. However, the carried out research shows that this status often becomes a discriminatory factor that imposes disproportionate restrictions on individuals. The current legal regulation of social payments for internally displaced persons contains a number of rigid and rather complicated administrative procedures that significantly restrict, and in some cases even generally make it impossible to obtain social protection. The only effective remedy for the protection of an infringed right for pensions or other social benefits for internally displaced persons is an appeal to a court. The courts do not always carry out effective and prompt protection of the violated law. Despite positive examples of judicial practice, it can not always provide an adequate and well-timed level of social protection, which causes the need for the improvement of national legislation.
