change due to fundamental shifts in the way data is generated, collected and processed. In order to address this challenge, several large scale social surveys have been integrated into the European Strategic Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI). This has allowed them to develop specialized and professionalized survey work flows within an integrated infrastructural context. This allows for greater sustainability through investment in survey methodologies and data collection which advance the field of social science. This paper examines three case studies within the ESFRI framework; The Survey of Health &amp; Retirement (SHARE) and the European Social Survey (ESS) are European Research Infrastructure Consortia and are both landmarks within the ESFRI landscape. The third case study is of the Generations &amp; Gender Programme which is an Emerging Community in the ESFRI landscape. The three case studies are used to illustrate the developments but also the persistent challenges for social surveys as they evolve with the framework of European Research Infrastructures. Each survey infrastructure is presented and it’s scientific, financial and governance sustainability.

Recent literature shows that parents generally accept their 
lesbian and gay children. However, parents do not always accept them immediately after they  come out. Acceptance takes time, and transitioning to acceptance is often a complex process that depends on parents’ access to the   necessary resources for coping with the stresses of knowing that their child identifies as lesbian or gay. These resources include counseling or therapy, supportive friends and extended family, and a network of other parents with lesbian and gay children. This study also highlights the need for further research on parental acceptance in non-traditional families and of children with other non-heterosexual identities, such as asexuality, gray ace, bisexuality, or pansexuality.

Unfortunately, however, these techniques have often been developed within disciplinary silos and without broad exposure to other potentially interested constituencies. In this paper, we traverse the literatures of social science, computer science, and statistics to examine a variety of modeling techniques for understanding neighborhood dynamics. We begin our review by examining early concepts of spatial structure first outlined in the Chicago School and discuss how the notions of social ecology and quantitative neighborhood analysis permeated the urban studies for several decades to come. Our survey continues by reviewing contemporary statistical approaches for identifying urban neighborhoods, culminating with the state of the art in subfields known as `geodemographics' and `regionalization'.

Second, we identify six key insights from the sociology of race and suggest how they could influence economic sociology: the emergence of race out of racism, an understanding of racism as structural, the role of whiteness, the intersections between racism and other systems of oppression, the ideology of colorblind racism, and the fundamental connections between racism and capitalism.

In European football, UEFA has attempted to ban “financial doping,” rich owners’ use of money earned in sectors other than football to pay large sums for the best football players. Campaign-finance reform efforts and “financial fair play” rules in sport may seem like bespoke solutions to different problems. In fact, they are the same solution to the same problem. Both are attempts to ensure that power accumulated in one market is not brought into another market so as to distort and damage its proper functioning. Market segregation, which seeks to bar explicit or implicit trans-market “currency” exchanges, disconnects the markets’ decisionmaking rationales. By understanding the segregation regulatory tool and its characteristic difficulties, including the appearance of black-market currency exchanges and the entrenchment of incumbents, it is possible to see in more general terms the challenges in many other legal settings, including moral rights and so-called “repugnant transactions.”",TRUE,FALSE,institutions|jurisprudence|markets|regulation,2019-02-26T20:15:41.999439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-26T20:14:56.104957,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4f|Law|Law and Economics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c62|Law|Jurisprudence,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/citation/,5ehmy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c757bc18d5d98001a3b8589/,5c757bc18d5d98001a3b8589,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ehmy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ehmy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ehmy,NA

Through a content analysis of 100 pairs of juxtaposed images from the first 24 hours of the hashtag, I examine the ways Black youth negotiate oppressive media representations and produce their own self-images. Through their strategic political response, the users of the hashtag demonstrate their “double consciousness” in a Du Boisian sense as well as their acute understanding of the specific symbols that mark a Black body as threatening and those that mediate the supposed threat. In doing so, however, they expose the limited number of templates available to them for performing an identity interpreted positively by the mainstream media and broader social world, as well as the continuing role of respectability politics in shaping public perceptions of Black youth.",TRUE,FALSE,black youth|double consciousness|race|representation|respectability politics|social media|social movements|visual sociology,2019-02-26T13:59:08.471068,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-26T13:57:56.527207,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,University of Illinois at Chicago,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/citation/,7jspe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c74308d62c82a0019db4338/,5c74308d62c82a0019db4338,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jspe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jspe,https://doi.org/10.1080/10999949.2018.1441587
