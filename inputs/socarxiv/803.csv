But the literature on knowledge production has to date recognized only in passing the role of intellectual property in this process. This paper applies the insights of knowledge production to the features of intellectual property regimes, both to flesh out the analysis of tacit knowledge codification, and to illuminate the role of intellectual property in the firm.  Patents, for example, constitute an explicitly codified form of technical knowledge, providing a stable common code for technical know-how, partially ameliorating the risks associated with loss of tacit knowledge. Codification through the patent system also provides important stability to attendant tacit knowledge. Patent doctrines regarding prior art, interference practice, and infringement all address the balance of tacit and codified knowledge. By functioning as a codification mechanism, patents may facilitate employee movement and entrepreneurial business spin-offs. Thus, aside from the usual justifications for patents in terms of incentive or disclosure, patenting may help to secure knowledge against loss or dissipation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,codification|knowledge management|patent|Preprint|socarxiv|tacit knowledge,2018-07-02T10:53:45.783670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T23:48:03.392000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/citation/,vuh9d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9rb37/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/relationships/node/,9rb37,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578976369ad5a101f2f5c3a3/,578976369ad5a101f2f5c3a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vuh9d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vuh9d

But this leads to the question of when a juridical corporate entity can be said to have 'knowledge' under the statute. Legal institutions have well-established processes for inferring the knowledge state of natural persons, but corporations are complex sociotechnical networks of human and non-human elements whose information state does not map well onto such inferential methods. This question is of course not unique to copyright liability; corporate entities may be responsible for 'knowing' actions under a variety of applicable legal provisions, and the question of corporate knowledge is generally under theorized.
