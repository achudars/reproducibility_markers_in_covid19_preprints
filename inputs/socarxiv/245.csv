We are interested in two different structures in the media coverage of scientific results. Firstly, the structure of sources that journalists use, i.e. scientific journals, and secondly, the congruence of the journalistic selection of single results. Previous research suggests that the selection of sources and results follows a certain heavy-tailed distribution, a power law. Mathematically, this distribution can be described with a function of the form C*x-α. We argue that the exponent of such power law distributions can potentially be an indicator to describe selectivity in journalism on a high aggregation level. In our input-output analysis, we look for such patterns in the coverage of all scientific results published in the database Scopus over four years. To get an estimate of the coverage of these results, we use data from the altmetrics provider Altmetric, more precisely their Mainstream-Media-Score (MSM-Score). Based on exploratory analyses, we define papers with a score of 50 or above as Social Impact Papers (SIPs). Over our study period, we identified 5,833 SIPs published in 1,236 journals. We consider a power law fit with an exponent of about -2 to be plausible for the distribution of the source selection but cannot confirm the power law hypothesis for the distribution of the selection of single results. In this case, an exponentially truncated power law seems to be the better fit.",TRUE,FALSE,automated data retrieval|heavy-tailed distributions|input-output analysis|power laws|science journalism|social dissemination of science|social structures,2020-03-06T11:11:02.229435,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T11:10:36.392775,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/citation/,jszt7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ep4na/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/relationships/node/,ep4na,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e621f440f987d01f74955e0/,5e621f440f987d01f74955e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jszt7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jszt7,NA

In this sense, Spain does not escape from these diagnoses. Both international indicators that try to measure the situation and evolution of freedom of expression in different States and academic scholars highlight the excessive criminalization of certain speeches that end up in criminal proceedings that sentence people who make offensive expressions, mainly through social networks. However, in order to reach this diagnosis it is necessary to put together all the symptoms that would lead us to that conclusion. Therefore, in this paper I analyze two main indicators that could shed more light on the state of freedom of expression in Spain and the impact that social networks have had on it. Firstly, I analyze the legislative evolution of expression offences since 1995, to evaluate the limits of certain expressions in order to reach the conclusion that, effectively, over the years the punitive scope of what cannot be expressed has been extended, thus limiting, at least in abstract, freedom of expression. Secondly, I analyze the jurisprudential evolution of all these crimes since 1995 to show that, indeed, the proliferation of sentences from 2015 to the present shows the increase in the criminalization of expressions that are made eminently through social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. To conclude, I reflect on the possibility that the latest absolutory sentence by the Constitutional Court of the singer of the band Def con Dos César Strawberry will increase the feeling that, from now on, all expression is admissible and, therefore, will increase free expression in general and, in particular, in social networks, since, it does not seem that our legislator is willing to rectify in its steps the excessive criminalization of certain offenses. I also reflect on the need to approach freedom of expression in a more empirical way and the need to evaluate not only the limitations that the law and judicial processes impose on freedom of expression, but also the extent to which citizens in general and, in particular, users of social networks, without the need to have gone through any criminal proceedings, have stopped expressing their opinions because only in this way will it be possible to determine the state of health of our right to freedom of expression.",TRUE,FALSE,criminal law|freedom of expression|self-censorship|social networks,2020-03-09T03:14:40.596944,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-09T03:14:23.436144,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/citation/,ufxwd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e621dc1a0964501d7051cfd/,5e621dc1a0964501d7051cfd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufxwd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufxwd,NA

Yet, previous studies are limited either by the way in which they measure family background or by the detail level by which they measure educational attainment. To address these two limitations, we develop a novel approach based on sibling similarities in labor market outcomes. Applying the approach to data on all Danes born 1965–1971, we examine the direct effect––other than through extremely granular education measures––of all combined effects of family background on occupational and income destinations. Our analyses show that the extremely fine-grained education measures can account for more than 90 percent of the total family background effect on occupational destinations, leaving little room for the processes associated with the direct effects of social origins to operate. For income destinations, however, the extremely fine-grained education measure accounts for merely three-quarters of the total family background effect. Roughly half of this direct effect on income destinations can be explained by sibling similarities in occupational choice, suggesting that family background affects income destinations through processes that operates equally within and between occupations. We discuss different mechanisms that may account for these results.",TRUE,FALSE,meritocratic|mobility|siblings,2020-03-06T11:07:23.343142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T11:07:02.398224,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/citation/,7w5m9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e62044fa0964501c805596b/,5e62044fa0964501c805596b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7w5m9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7w5m9,NA

Each of these changes may influence children’s nutritional status, which is sensitive to food availability, access, and utilization, and which may have lasting consequences for later-life health and socioeconomic outcomes. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on climate and child health by studying the effects of temperature and precipitation exposures on children’s height and weight in Indonesia. Drawing on five rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) implemented between 1993 and 2015, we estimate fixed-effects regression models of height-for-age (HFA) and weight-for-height (WFH) among samples of children ages 24-59 months and 0-23 months, respectively. We test for heterogeneity in these effects across sub-populations expected to vary in their vulnerability. Results show that delays in monsoon onset are consistently associated with worse child health outcomes. Delays in monsoon onset during the prenatal period are associated with reduced child height among children age 2-4 years, and these effects are concentrated among males. The weight of young (&lt;2 years) children is adversely affected by delays in the most recent monsoon season, and this relationship is particularly strong among residents of Java.

Since the establishment of the National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) in 2008, the Vietnamese scientific community had adapted to new international standards in 2014 and 2017, which resulted in different productivity between social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines. Therefore, to understand the effects of new research policies, this study deploys Bayesian analysis on a comprehensive dataset of 1,564 Vietnamese authors in the 2008-2018 period. The dataset was extracted from the exclusively designed Social Sciences Humanities Peer Award (SSHPA) database (http://sshpa.com/). Various factors are considered in the data collecting process, including age, gender, new authors in a year, leading authors, co- authorship, and journal’s Impact Factor (JIF). The findings indicate three main characteristics of the Vietnamese SSH community after the research policy application. First, in terms of output, Economics is the dominant field relative to other SSH’s disciplines in Vietnam. It has contributed 858 publications in 12 years, about two times as much as the total output of Education, the second place. Economics also experiences a high level of contribution from authors at the age of 40-44 and nearly 500 new authors within the period. Secondly, despite a rapid rise in the number of lead authors, gender disparity among disciplines is a critical issue. Male researchers outnumber female ones in Economics and Social medicine, with Education being the sole exception. Lastly, authors in Education appears to have less international collaboration than those in Social medicine, Economics, and other fields. The success of Economics could be a reference point for other SSH disciplines to increase their research output. These findings enable a better understanding of SSH research policy application and call for a more suitable policy to support female academics in a number of SSH fields.",TRUE,FALSE,research policy application|scientific productivity|social medicine|Social sciences and humanities|SSHPA database,2020-03-06T11:04:40.856085,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T11:04:19.574299,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/citation/,kd9gh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6134f2a09645014905207e/,5e6134f2a09645014905207e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kd9gh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kd9gh,NA

In this study, we critically appraise the intersections and differences between the two movements. Based on our thematic comparison here, we conclude several key things. First, there is substantial scope for new communities of practice to form within scholarly communities that place sharing and collaboration/open participation at their focus. Second, Both the principles and practices of FOSS can be more deeply ingrained within scholarship, asserting a balance between pragmatism and social ideology. Third, at the present, Open Scholarship risks being subverted and compromised by commercial players. Fourth, the shift and acceleration towards a system of Open Scholarship will be greatly enhanced by a concurrent shift in recognising a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer review and research articles. In order to achieve this, we propose the formulation of a new type of institutional mandate. We believe that there is substantial need for research funders to invest in sustainable open scholarly infrastructure, and the communities that support them, to avoid the capture and enclosure of key research services that would prevent optimal researcher behaviours. Such a shift could ultimately lead to a healthier scientific culture, and a system where competition is replaced by collaboration, resources (including time and people) are shared and acknowledged more efficiently, and the research becomes inherently more rigorous, verified, and reproducible.",TRUE,FALSE,Collaboration|Communities|FLOSS|FOSS|Freedom|Free Software|Open Access|Open Data|Open Research|Open Research Practices|Open Scholarship|Open Science|Open Source|Replicability|Reproducibility|Scholarly Communication|Scholarly Publishing|Sharing,2020-03-06T04:50:08.092196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T04:49:36.475054,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/citation/,2kxq8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8buvz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/relationships/node/,8buvz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e608c770f987d00fa495209/,5e608c770f987d00fa495209,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2kxq8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2kxq8,NA

This disadvantages researchers in the global south, policy makers and practitioners who have the skills to use research findings but do not have journal subscriptions. Open access seeks to increase availability of research, but take-up among criminologists has been low. This study used a sample of 12,541 articles published in criminology journals between 2017 and 2019 to estimate the proportion of articles available via different types of open access. Overall 22% of research was available to non-subscribers, about half that found in other disciplines, even though authors had the right to make articles open without payment in at least 95% of cases.

But how do lifestyles arise and change? We propose that friendship networks shape lifestyles, while simultaneously being a product of lifestyles. Combining theories of health lifestyles—interrelated health behaviors arising from group-based identities—with network and behavior change, we examined influence and selection processes between friendship networks and health lifestyles. We analyzed two high schools with longitudinal, complete friendship network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Latent class analyses characterized each school’s predominant health lifestyles based on several health behavior domains. School-specific stochastic actor-based models (SABMs) evaluated the bidirectional relationship between friendship networks and health lifestyles. Predominant lifestyles remained stable within schools over time, even as individuals transitioned between lifestyles. In both schools, friends displayed more similarity in health lifestyles than other peers, and this similarity resulted primarily from selection, but also from influence processes.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescence|health lifestyles|latent class analysis|social networks|stochastic actor-based models,2020-03-06T04:51:45.422937,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T04:51:31.534949,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/citation/,xnd39,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9h7fs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/relationships/node/,9h7fs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6006a10f987d00c3494bfd/,5e6006a10f987d00c3494bfd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnd39/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xnd39/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xnd39,NA

Saule Anafinova. ELTE Doctoral School of Education.","The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical literature review of studies or university identity change under the influence of global competition. The literature review is organized by the three theoretical perspectives - political economy, neo-liberalism and new institutionalism (Chirikov, 2016). The main idea of the literature review is to prove that although studies of rankings proliferate, the institutional approach gives the best insight into the phenomenon. Despite this fact, the institutional approach is underrepresented in the field.  Oversight of the influence of global rankings on university identity can be observed.",TRUE,FALSE,pre-print,2020-03-09T03:17:05.937592,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-09T03:16:42.587488,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5e|Education|Higher Education|Scholarship of Teaching and Learning|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d71|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d73|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision|Higher Education Administration,Saule Anafinova,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/citation/,pjbv3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5ff3e10f987d00b94945d7/,5e5ff3e10f987d00b94945d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pjbv3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pjbv3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pjbv3,NA

Whether the findings from these studies are applicable to countries with legal, religious, and cultural contexts regarding sexual and gender minorities distinct from Western societies is yet to be explored. To fill this gap, this paper summarizes the findings from focus groups and a pilot survey conducted to develop SOGI questions in the Japanese context. For sexual orientation identity, a six-category question that includes definition of each category, and for transgender status, a three-step method, are suggested for general use. The paper also reports on percentage distributions of SOGI by assigned sex at birth and by age group based on the Osaka City Residents' Survey, one of the first population-based surveys in Japan with SOGI questions. Overall, our findings illustrate the significance of examining the measurement of SOGI beyond Western societies.",TRUE,FALSE,focus groups|LGBT|measurement|population-based study|recommended survey questions on SOGI,2020-03-04T14:40:26.947567,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-04T14:39:59.065088,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/citation/,w9mjn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5edce50f987d003749444f/,5e5edce50f987d003749444f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9mjn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w9mjn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w9mjn,NA
