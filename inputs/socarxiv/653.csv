Many divide the discipline of philosophy to Western and Eastern, however, it is argued that this division suffers from the logical fallacy of false dichotomy. A widespread belief that spirituality and theology are subtypes of philosophy is indeed a myth; the formal philosophy deals only with the rational persuasion of ideas to find answers to the real world problems.  An understanding of logic and dialectic is needed to formulate persuasive arguments, which in turn is crucial for the future of any learned citizens, for example, while writing an excellent essay or delivering a charismatic public speech. Albeit the high relevance of this discipline, in India, philosophy is not taught as part of the school or university curricula, which I find a significant foible in our education system. Importance of having one's philosophy of life is elucidated. My own philosophy of life, including Politics, Epistemology, Metaphysics, Ethics and Aesthetics is expounded in this essay.

Research on physicians’ decisions about medical knowledge has focused on doctors’ personal capabilities and features of the knowledge corpus, producing divergent findings. This study addresses these findings by asking instead: how is decision-making about the use of knowledge influenced by specific features of work? From observations of one team’s decisions in multiple clinical and administrative contexts involving different tasks, I argue that the pattern for making specific decisions is contingent upon the length of feedback loops that are specified by the temporal features of physicians’ different tasks. Physicians receive feedback at different speeds depending on the temporal features of a task and they must account for these speeds when they judge what they can prioritize. This finding explains doctors’ perceived uncertainty in other studies as a product of the long feedback loop in tasks, and their certainty or pragmatism as a product of shorter feedback loops. In these short-feedback scenarios, physicians consult and deploy scientific knowledge after determining a profitable plan of action (and not exclusively before, as is usually assumed). This knowledge is deployed in “Bayesian Performances,” where studies are quoted as a credible warrant for pursuing projected outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,decision-making|ethnography|medicine|professions|uncertainty,2018-07-02T11:21:42.896274,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-06T23:13:49.169349,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/citation/,s54yu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wktcz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/relationships/node/,wktcz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a00ec1a6c613b0274b96adc/,5a00ec1a6c613b0274b96adc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s54yu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s54yu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s54yu,https://doi.org/10.1086/679105

I develop a conceptual framework in which their decisions to use advanced technologies are informed by “interdependent career types,” a concept that incorporates features of the professional social context of physicians’ work and the expertise they use, and reflects how medicine distributes expertise via formal and informal referral structures. I draw on data regarding specialized physicians’ differentiated use of this technology over five years, as well as interviews with those who continue to use the technology and those who have abandoned it. I argue that interdependent career types stratify physicians’ standpoints on multiple dimensions of medical work – including those related to their concerns about reputation, inclinations towards risk, and preferences regarding the use of their bodies.",TRUE,FALSE,careers|medicine|professions|robotics,2018-07-02T11:21:42.859084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-06T23:09:15.965424,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/citation/,95ygk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m4g6j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/relationships/node/,m4g6j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a00eb15594d9002646615df/,5a00eb15594d9002646615df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/95ygk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/95ygk,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146517738088

This article focuses on how people who share and engage in tasks in recurrently-visited venues define and change their social projects’ problems and solutions. To address the complexities of this “meta-work,” I introduce the concept of “tethers.” Tethers are links across venues that people use to set and shift these problems and solutions that are continuously being contested. Drawing on examples from the author’s fieldwork and other ethnographic accounts of professional work, I examine three types of tethers: focal participants, things, and language. Paying attention to tethers also results in practical implications for taking fieldnotes, timing observations, and choosing fieldsites.

Existing accounts have focused on anti-immigration attitudes, anti-establishment sentiment and on the ‘left behind’, as well as on national identity. This paper expands the range of possible explanations for the vote by considering a wider range of identity measures, including class and racial identities, and by considering in detail the role played by connectedness to others and to localities. We find evidence that racial identity was particularly important for White British voters, extending our understanding of the relationship between territorial identities, ethnicity and attitudes towards the European Union. Connectedness via networks also structures attitudes, with those with higher levels of and more diverse connections having more favourable attitudes towards the EU. Whilst these effects are smaller than those of education and age, they are nonetheless comparable with those of class and income, and suggest that we should be wary of accounts of attitudes towards the EU that fail to locate voters within their social contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Brexit|Civic Engagement|Connectedness|Diversity|Ethnicity|EU Referendum 2016|European Union|Euroscepticism|National identity|Neighbourhood|Personality|Social Capital|Social Networks,2018-07-02T11:20:49.461804,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-06T09:58:12.747110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Siobhan McAndrew; Paula Surridge; Neema Begum,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/citation/,w95xa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wtvmg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/relationships/node/,wtvmg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ff90c79ad5a1027a3c8255/,59ff90c79ad5a1027a3c8255,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w95xa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w95xa,NA

Since this time, RJ has experienced rapid growth in theory and practice. At the same time, much of this growth has come from expansion in lower-end criminal justice responses to crime, and in the increasing use of the term “restorative” for a widening host of practices and interventions. RJ has also faced problems related to its increasing institutionalization, resulting in divergence from earlier aims and goals.

Inappropriate versions of these rules are used by the national and provincial health services of the UK and several of the commonwealth countries, and they are also commonly used in published cost-effectiveness analyses.  Here the correct decision rules are derived from standard utilitarian welfare premises and two different models of the optimizing behavior of a rational health care agency.

The contentious discourse on this boundary is particularly salient given the unprecedented levels of population ageing all over the world. This paper analyzes the discursive field surrounding a notable Italian end-of-life controversy. Combining field and narrative theories, the present study spans structural aspects and rhetorical mechanisms. Results show that not only are antithetical interpretations of the event tied to media’s ideological leanings, but the latter are also systematically associated with different sequential structures of headlines and story leads. Competing actors produce alternative frameworks by identifying different sets of perpetrators.",TRUE,FALSE,End-of-life|Field|Meaning|Media|Narrative|Sequence,2018-07-02T11:20:45.960119,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-03T16:51:38.693412,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/citation/,ba892,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tqcg8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/relationships/node/,tqcg8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59fc9cd5594d90026464b2af/,59fc9cd5594d90026464b2af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba892/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ba892/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ba892,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023117748111
