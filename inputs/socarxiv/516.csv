The frequency of this disorder now is one per 60–80 infants, against 1:5000-10000 approximately 60–70 years ago. Because epidemics of genetic disease do not occur, this confirms that most cases of autism are not associated with the genome problems but rather with the progressive deepening of environmental problems. Environmental pressure may be barely noticeable for an adult, but this could disturb the development of a much more fragile foetus. A variety of industrial and agricultural pollutants, heavy metals, pathogenic bacteria, etc. may be involved in the pathogenesis of autism. All of them cause similar persistent changes in the production of autoantibodies and cytokines influencing the foetal development. Moreover, trans-placental transfer of the excess of some maternal аuto-antibodies of IgG class leads to pre-birth ‘tuning’ of the immune system of the foetus by mechanisms of maternal immune imprinting. This phenomenon could be an additional factor in the pathogenesis of autism. It is noted that the environment-induced immune changes are mostly adaptive for the mother; however, for the unborn child, they can often be the factors of pathogenesis.

Psychometrics and its close relation with statistics provides the scientific foundations and the standards that guide the development and use of psychological instruments, some of which are tests or inventories. This field has its own historic foundations and its particular analytical specificities and, while some are widely used analytical methods among psychologists and educational researchers, the history of psychometrics is either widely unknown or only partially known by these researchers or other students.
Objectives: With that being said, this paper provides a succinct review of the history of psychometrics and its methods. From a theoretical approach, this study explores and describes the Classical Test Theory (CTT) and the Item Response Theory (IRT) frameworks and its models to deal with questions such as validity and reliability. Different aspects that gravitate around the field, in addition to recent developments are also discussed, including Goodness-of-Fit and Differential Item Functioning and Differential Test Functioning.
Conclusions:This theoretical article helps to enhance the body of knowledge on psychometrics, it is especially addressed to social and educational researchers, and also contributes to training these scientists.

It is also more common for physiotherapists to pay attention to cognitive rehabilitation and psychosocial factors. ReAttach is a short-term multimodal intervention combining: a) sensory integration, b) cognitive rehabilitation and c) systemic work.
Recently ReAttach was introduced in the field of neuro-rehabilitation and therefore it is professionally applied by medics (physiotherapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists) and by neuropsychologists as well.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this case-study is to evaluate the effectivity of ReAttach in a patient with CVA by applying the intervention which includes stimulation of sensory integration and cognitive rehabilitation. Can this patient with CVA benefit from ReAttach?
METHOD: Five ReAttach sessions were applied to a patient with CVA in both hemispheres. Also his wife received five ReAttach sessions as part of the systemic approach. Pre- and post- measurements on functional skills, balance, fatigue and global condition were conducted to evaluate results. Follow up after 2 months.
RESULTS: The results of this case-study suggest that by simultaneously stimulating sensory integration, cognitive rehabilitation and influencing environmental factors (ReAttach) a significant positive change can be achieved in a patient with CVA.
CONCLUSION: Although this result is promising, more research is needed to further investigate the effectivity of ReAttach in larger controlled samples in neuro-rehabilitation.

Practical research indicates that ReAttach significantly reduces psychological problems in both adults and children. Theories on ReAttach state that this is done by creating functional schemas, which in turn create more effective coping styles in clients and decrease psychological distress.
Objectives: This article aims to provide a better understanding of ReAttach theory and give insight in the treatment process.
Methods: This is done by linking theory to the treatment process of a young adult (N=1) with symptoms of social anxiety.
Results: The psychological distress in the client decreased from 32 (serious problems) to 12 (no problems).

Anti-transgender bias in individuals may result in widespread discrimination across society.  Survivors of sexual assault often access social services for support in healing from sexual assault and navigating legal options. Social workers, healthcare workers, and support service workers may play a part in creating or reducing barriers for transgender people in their workplace, hospitals, prisons, treatment centers, legal systems, and other social service institutions. What barriers do transgender survivors of sexual assault face and how can social service organizations alleviate these barriers? 
I analyzed 22 archived surveys completed online by transgender survivors of sexual assault using content analysis, which grounds the results and discussion in the voices of transgender survivors themselves. I identified four main categories of barriers faced by transgender survivors when accessing sexual assault support services: interpersonal, organizational, institutional, and intersectional. The interpersonal barriers describe how a transgender person’s perception of self and other influences decisions to engage with support systems and how to act while receiving support. Organizational barriers represent cultures and norms in organizations which create barriers. We found institutional barriers across the healthcare and the legal systems. Barriers for transgender people also intersect with other oppression, such as racism, ableism, and classism. I discuss the barriers transgender people reported, the analysis which categorized these barriers and I use their words to find potential solutions.

To examine plasma concentration of IgA, IgM, IgG classes, and IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 subclasses in children with autism.
 Methods. Infantile autism was diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria. Plasma samples were collected from 35 autistic subjects, and their 21 siblings (biological brothers and sisters)who served as healthy controls. Plasma samples were separated by centrifugation and stored at –20 C until the determination. Plasma immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgA, IgG) and subclasses
 (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) were determined using a nephelometer.
 Results. Plasma concentrations (mean standard deviation) of IgM and IgG in autistic children (1.36 0.31 g/L and 13.14 1.27 g/L, respectively) were significantly higher (p=0.031 and p=0.023, respectively) in comparison with their healthy brothers or sisters (1.20 0.15 g/L and 12.39 0.96 g/L, respectively). Children with autism had significantly higher plasma concentrations of IgG4 (p&lt;0.001) compared to their siblings (healthy brothers or sisters). Plasma concentration of IgA, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 were similar in autistic children and their healthy brothers or sisters. Increased plasma concentration of IgG1 was found (p=0.027) in autistic males (8.06 2.40), as compared with their healthy brothers (5.24 4.13 g/L). Plasma concentrations of IgG (14.28 3.66 g/L), and IgG1 (9.41 2.20 g/L) in autistic females were increased (p=0.012 and p=0.021, respectively) in comparison with IgG (11.07 2.07) and IgG1 (6.37 3.38g/L) in their healthy sisters.
 Conclusion. Children with autism have increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulines. Increased immunoglobulines in children with autism could be a result of impaired development of the immune system, and/or genetic factors connected with defense mechanism in these children.",TRUE,FALSE,autistic disorder|immunoglobulin isotypes|Macedonia,2018-11-26T02:41:41.864033,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-26T02:41:16.207660,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5a|Education|Special Education and Teaching|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/citation/,vrt3b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qn3cs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/relationships/node/,qn3cs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfa8bce7a554700167336fa/,5bfa8bce7a554700167336fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vrt3b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vrt3b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vrt3b,NA

These components are: excessive intensity of emotions, poor processing of emotions and negative reactivity to emotions, which overlap as well as distinct symptoms with possible manifestations of emotional dysregulation like angry outbursts or behaviour outbursts such as destroying or throwing objects, aggression towards self or others, and threats to kill oneself, especially in young adults. These patients have a chronically and ongoing difficult time with the level of cooperation and social ability required for a healthy and fulfilling existence. ReAttach Therapy through its Multiple Sensory Integration Processing by Cognitive Bias Modification, has been found to be very helpful in the effective management of maladaptive emotions and helps developing interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation skills (expressing emotions effectively), behaviour control and distress situations management skills, which in turn helps the overall decrease in symptomatology of the above mentioned disorders.",TRUE,FALSE,Cognitive Bias Modification|Distress Situation Management Skills|Emotional Dysregulation|ReAttach Therapy,2018-11-26T02:39:01.167169,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-26T02:38:37.304595,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/citation/,3yc7z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a3sgd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/relationships/node/,a3sgd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfa8954c21cd8001aa581d4/,5bfa8954c21cd8001aa581d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3yc7z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3yc7z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3yc7z,https://doi.org/10.26407/2018jrtdd.1.2
