A disadvantage of this index is however, that only national values are available, whereas within many countries huge subnational variation in development exists. Here we present the Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI), which shows within-country variation in human development across the globe. Covering more than 1600 regions within 160 countries, the SHDI and its dimension indices provide a ten times higher-resolution picture than was available before. Within-country variation is particularly strong in low and middle developed countries and less important in the most developed ones. Education disparities explain most SHDI inequality within low-developed countries and standard of living differences within more highly developed countries. With the SHDI, global socio-economic change can be studied with unprecedented coverage and detail.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-25T14:19:03.351409,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-25T14:18:50.877178,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/citation/,hskue,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4b19840d1c9e00174c0c2c/,5c4b19840d1c9e00174c0c2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hskue/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hskue/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hskue,NA

In this review, we argue that greater investment in automation would be one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to boost the reliability, validity, and utility of social science research. We identify five core areas ripe for potentially transformative investment, including (1) machine-readable standards, (2) data access platforms, (3) search and discoverability, (4) claim validation, and (5) insight generation. In each case, we review limitations associated with current practices, identify concrete opportunities for improvement via automation, and discuss near-term barriers to progress.

He claims that as women have demanded less from men in exchange for sex, the institution of marriage has been undermined. Regnerus suggests that shifts in women’s sexual behavior have “cheapened” sex because straight men are no longer obliged to offer concessions such as protection, resources, attention, or fidelity to gain access to sex with women. Thus, according to Regnerus, the decline in marriage—and the nuclear family—is caused by women’s newfound willingness to be “promiscuous.” These claims represent a nostalgic plea for a time when young women were expected to wait for marriage to have sex, accept reproduction as a likely outcome of sex, and rely on the material resources of a male partner.

This study examines how gender inequalities in evaluations depend on the design of the tools used to judge merit. Exploiting a quasi-natural experiment at a large North American university, we found that the number of scale points used in faculty teaching evaluations—whether instructors were rated on a scale of 6 versus a scale of 10—significantly affected the size of the gender gap in evaluations. A survey experiment, which presented all participants with an identical lecture transcript but randomly varied instructor gender and the number of scale points, replicated this finding and suggested that the number of scale points affects the extent to which gender stereotypes of brilliance are expressed in quantitative ratings. These results highlight how seemingly minor technical aspects of performance ratings can have a major effect on the evaluation of men and women. Our findings thus contribute to a growing body of work on organizational practices that reduce workplace inequalities and the sociological literature on how rating systems—rather than being neutral instruments—shape the distribution of rewards in organizations.",TRUE,FALSE,classification systems|employment|gender|higher education|inequalities|performance evaluations|teaching evaluations|work and occupations,2019-01-25T03:03:26.801447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-25T03:02:45.271138,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Lauren A.

migration in the capital of Denmark. In US studies, a high or increasing proportion of racial or ethnic
minorities in inner city neighborhoods is seen as the prime motivation for ‘white flight;’ White
middle-class families moving towards racially and ethnically homogeneous suburbs. The relatively
egalitarian Scandinavian setting offers a contrasting case, where inner cities are less deprived, and
where minority groups primarily consist of immigrants and children of immigrants that have arrived
over the past few decades. Using rich, population-wide, longitudinal administrative data over a
twelve-year period, linked to exact coordinates on places of residence, we document how the
geographical distribution of minorities within Copenhagen relates to native out-migration. We
observe increasing out-migration among the native majority population from areas with high and
increasing minority concentrations, largely supporting the hypothesis of a ‘native flight’ mobility

The relevant literature links emigration to states’ developmental needs, which does not explain why some states choose to economically subsidize their citizens’ emigration. This article explores for the first time the soft power importance of high-skilled emigration from authoritarian emigration states. It finds that the Egyptian state under Gamal Abdel Nasser employed labor emigration for two distinct purposes linked to broader soft power interests: first, as an instrument of cultural diplomacy to spread revolutionary ideals of Arab unity and anti-imperialism across the Middle East; second, as a tool for disseminating development aid, particularly in Yemen and sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing on Arabic and non-Arabic primary sources, the article identifies the interplay between foreign policy and cross-border mobility, while also sketching an evolving research agenda on authoritarian emigration states’ policy-making.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab Cold War|Arab-Israeli Conflict|Arab migrants|Egypt|Emigrants|Middle East migration|Migration and Education|Nasser|Soft power,2019-01-23T22:07:48.423001,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-23T22:04:36.309602,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/citation/,w58yj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c481cf32e57200018fddaa3/,5c481cf32e57200018fddaa3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w58yj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w58yj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w58yj,https://doi.org/10.1177/0192512118759902
