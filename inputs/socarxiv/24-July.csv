This general version of the philosophy of science explains the general picture of philosophy itself, including the history of its development altogether.

They, the current generation, are predicted to be the country's most valuable investment. With the superior and highly competitive human resources of the millennial and generation Z generations, the potential to meet towards a Great Indonesia, the future Golden Indonesia will achieve achievements.
The book entitled ""Millennial Ideas &amp; Generation Z for a Golden Indonesia 2045"" intends to criticize, review, and provide ideas about four critical aspects of the state. By paying attention to the country's fundamental values, this book aims to open up public views regarding essential issues to welcome a better state life towards a developed Indonesia, Golden Indonesia 2045.
In general, this book is intended for all groups, especially the young generation of the nation's future. However, on the other hand, this book seems explicit to provide criticism and input to state administrators in responding to various problems faced by the state. So young people, namely the millennial generation and generation Z as the nation's next-generation, should play an active role, participate, and work together with the government to realize the nation's hopes in the future.
The lesson that can be learned from this book is that the readers will become more aware of the problems faced by the state. Moreover, this book contains four sections covering ideas for education, economics, politics, and socio-cultural areas, which are essential aspects of supporting state life. It is hoped that these ideas will become a reference point and a foundation in overcoming problems and a leap for millennials and generation Z to participate in bringing the life of the Indonesian state towards progress. As a young generation, millennials and generation Z should care more about matters related to their country. This book is interesting to read and review because the ideas written in this book positively affect all readers.

Indeed, both the original American progressives of a century ago, as well as Thomas Piketty, whose work sparked contemporary intellectual interest in inequality, agree that inequality’s source is scarcity, rather than monopoly, and so will persist even in perfectly competitive markets. The only real solution is taxation, not a potentially destructive campaign of breakup. There are two cause of contemporary American antimonopolism. The first is American anti-statism, which has closed off tax policy as a viable political solution to inequality, forcing scholars and activists to seek a second- or third-best workaround in antitrust policy. The second is the American press, which is actively promoting antimonopolism as a way of fighting back against Google and Facebook, two companies that have badly outcompeted the press for advertising dollars in recent years. Given these  idiosyncratic roots of contemporary American antimonopolism, other jurisdictions seeking to address inequality may have little to gain from following the American example, particularly if taxation remains a viable policy option for them.",TRUE,FALSE,|antimonopolism|antitrust|double distortion|inequality|monopoly|monopoly rents|Piketty|progressives|scarcity rents|tax and transfer|taxation|wealth distribution,2021-06-11T09:02:26.965782,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-11T08:17:52.656733,TRUE,This research was supported by a grant from the John S. and James L.

In this analysis, we leverage data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to explore the possibility of “spillover” effects on male high school classmates related to women’s access to contraception during adolescence and young adulthood. We use school-based surveys of sexual activity and use of birth control pills to ask whether males who attend schools with higher proportions of contracepting young women classmates have different adult outcomes than those attending schools with lower proportions. We hypothesized that higher rates of birth control use would lower the likelihood of pregnancy during the adolescent years, which would in turn increase young men’s future education levels, income levels, and age at first birth.
Our analyses did not reveal statistically significant associations between birth control use and young men's longer-term education, income, and family formation outcomes. However, we speculate that these null results are more likely to reflect low statistical power and data limitations than a true lack of association between these factors. Specifically, because surveys only gather information on birth control use when women report being sexually active, the measure may not fully reflect the range of contraceptive users. Additionally, findings of “spillover” effects are expected to be smaller than main effects of contraception for women, limiting our ability to uncover these effects in modest-sized samples. Future research should explore whether larger samples allow more precision in estimates, but most data may suffer from an inability to measure “peer” young women of men under study.

I show that the pairwise correlations between cultural beliefs increase and the structure of personal culture becomes relatively more aligned before entering adulthood. Moreover, the rate of personal change slows down with each year of age, suggesting that the alignment process is most prevalent in specific socialization periods. Using four waves of data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, I test these propositions through an analysis of religious belief networks.

But after the stringent lockdown, there has been an acute increase in impoverishment as governmental food policies have further exacerbated rather than mitigated inequalities. Families eligible under the National Food Security Act (NFSA, 2013) have been provided with double food grain rations during two waves of the pandemic. But nearly 45 percent of India’s population without these ration cards have been excluded from any additional food relief from the central government. Simultaneously, India’s food grain stocks in government granaries have accumulated manifold with two years of bumper harvests. Therefore, in light of the acute distress faced by marginalised communities due to the pandemic and unprecedented economic recession, this paper analyses the availability of adequate foodgrain stocks and contends that the time is ripe for the universal expansion of the public distribution system.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Food Corporation of India|Hunger|Public Distribution System|Universalisation,2021-06-11T09:03:41.879486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-11T08:18:47.466743,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/citation/,u2pm4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c23453f3ce940201250ba4/,60c23453f3ce940201250ba4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2pm4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2pm4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2pm4,NA
