Its implementation is expected to advance the government’s health agenda, particularly in terms of child mortality reduction and maternal health improvement. Despite the growing evidence on the positive health outcomes resulting from the implementation of CCT programs, evidence remains limited to the qualitative evaluation of health care service utilization among beneficiary households. In this regard, by employing key interviews and focus group discussion, this study aims to examine the impacts of 4Ps on health and nutrition as experienced and perceived by beneficiaries at a community-level implementation. After subjecting the interview transcripts to thematic network analysis, the results reveal six dominant themes: enhanced health practices, improved uptake of health care services, increased awareness on health issues, improved living conditions, responsive program implementation, and persisting implementation challenges. While it is evident that the positive impacts are reflective of the beneficiaries’ strict compliance to meet the program conditionalities, there is still much to be done to ensure the sustainability of the program. The provision for adequate health care should then be supplemented with reinforced delivery of the program’s learning component (family development session) and support mechanism to the implementers.",TRUE,FALSE,Conditional Cash Transfer|Health Outcomes|Social Welfare|Thematic Network Analysis,2021-05-08T23:53:24.722655,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-08T23:52:41.965375,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/citation/,4wzx7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609478aa6801ab047f2ac19c/,609478aa6801ab047f2ac19c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wzx7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4wzx7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4wzx7,NA

We provide a descriptive summary of our data and estimate a series of linear models to determine if annotator racial identity and our 12 topics, alone or in combination, explain the way racial sentiment was annotated, net of relevant annotator characteristics and tweet features.

In this paper, I explore the role of rising house prices over this period in explaining widening White-Black wealth gaps. I combine geocoded longitudinal data on household wealth from the nationally-representative Panel Study of Income Dynamics with Census tract house price index data to estimate how the distributions of White and Black household wealth would have changed under a counterfactual scenario where house prices did not appreciate from 2013 to 2019. I find that rising house prices account for most of the increase in the White-Black wealth gap over this period. While Black homeowners did benefit from greater Census tract-level house price appreciation than White homeowners, White households benefited more from rising house prices overall due to having greater rates of homeownership and higher house values than Black households. Given the important role of institutional racism through the 20th century in explaining White-Black gaps in homeownership and house values, these findings demonstrate a pathway through which the legacies of institutional racism contribute to present-day racial inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,housing|race|wealth,2021-05-06T20:20:24.681611,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-06T20:19:49.224264,FALSE,NA,no,Requires access to PSID Between-Wave Moves file.,,no,,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Joe LaBriola,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/citation/,rp3ed,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f2atb/,f2atb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609416d919183d0451557f1e/,609416d919183d0451557f1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rp3ed/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rp3ed/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rp3ed,NA

Garissa County in north eastern Kenya has the highest prevalence of FGM in Kenya at 94%.  This practise was illegalised in Kenya in 2011. This study aimed to assess the successes of anti-FGM programs in Garissa County. 
Method: This was a cross sectional study involving 109 participants of both genders and different age groups. Questionnaires were used in data collection. Obtained data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Chi-square was used to compare characteristics between female participants who had undergone FGM and participants not circumcised. 
Results: Of the 109 participants, 53.7% were female. The median age of participants was 23 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 15-40). The prevalence of FGM was 62% with the mean age at circumcision being 8.34 years (SD 2.69 years). Being of Muslim faith was associated with practice of FGM (p&lt;0.001). There was high level of awareness of the antiFGM law among youth at 84%. Two thirds of participants did not support FGM. Excision was the main type of FGM practiced. Trained nurses had circumcised 14.7% of study participants.  
Conclusion: Introduction of the antiFGM law, and its advocacy by NGOs has led to a reduction in the practice of FGM in Garissa county. There is an increase in the medicalization of FGM in Garissa with evidence of the practice going underground.

Using an ecological approach in understanding how community resilience is situated within multiple settings, this qualitative study examines the lay accounts of 30 residents and authorities who experienced three major natural disasters. A thematic network analysis of the interview responses surface six dominant organizing themes:  sense of preparedness, sense of togetherness, effective leadership of local authorities, service provision at the macro level, rebuilding in a self-reliant manner, and preparedness for future disasters. The dominant themes are considered relevant in sustaining the capacity of the participants to respond to, cope with, and recover from adversity. The findings reveal that collective actions, which are further strengthened by the presence of care, support, and assistance emerging from every system level, support community resilience.

Farmers are particularly vulnerable to such adverse effects given their limited adaptive capacity. In this regard, this study examines the local adaptation experiences and practices of farmers in a second-class farming municipality. It is then based on the assumption that a lay understanding of how farmers perceive and adapt to climate change can be used to provide implications for enhancing their adaptive capacity. Using a combination of qualitative data from key informant interviews and focus group discussion and secondary data from government agencies, this paper reveals that farmers perceive serious health and livelihood risks despite having limited knowledge of how climate change occurs. They recognize that changes in climate conditions have caused considerable effects to temperature and rainfall which, in turn, have posed serious challenge to water supply. Their farming activities are also at risk from interrelated impacts such as damage to crops, pest infestation, and decrease in rice yield. Hence, they consistently employ common adaptation measures as direct responses to climate variability such as the planting of new crop varieties, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, use of technology in farming, and diversification of household income. However, the lack of financial resources hinders them from utilizing new adaptation techniques and technologies, which they perceive to be more appropriate and beneficial. These results suggest a more conscious effort of transforming coping strategies to short-term climate variability into adaptation measures to long-term climate changes.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|agriculture|climate change|farmers|Philippines,2021-05-06T15:39:43.937720,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-06T15:38:54.133643,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security,Journal of Rural and Community Development,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/citation/,s8ahz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609401fa5533b4047ee1ed7e/,609401fa5533b4047ee1ed7e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8ahz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s8ahz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s8ahz,NA

This empirical literature has overlooked a crucial assumption regarding the definition of the treatment, however—the part of the stable unit treatment value assumption referred to as the consistency assumption in epidemiology. The consequence of ignoring this assumption has been that results have been misinterpreted and over-generalized. I illustrate these problems using examples from seminal studies from the natural experiments literature and present how to improve definitions of the treatment in future studies. Correctly interpreted LATEs are substantially more specific than previously acknowledged but reclaim their internal validity. By providing clear and careful definitions of the treatment and substantive interpretations of the results, future studies will increase their usefulness by presenting the causal effect that has been actually estimated.",TRUE,FALSE,causal effects|consistency|instrumental variables|interpreting causal effects|local average treatment effects|SUTVA,2021-05-06T15:22:47.775621,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-06T15:22:23.405260,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/citation/,pkyue,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kuj24/,kuj24,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6093e4d95533b4046de23832/,6093e4d95533b4046de23832,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkyue/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pkyue/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pkyue,NA
