A Scoping Review of Methods to Establish Race and Ethnicity from Twitter Datasets,"Background: A growing amount of health research uses social media data. Those critical of social media research often cite that it may be unrepresentative of the population. Identifying the demographics of social media users enables us to measure the representativeness. Extracting race or ethnicity from social media data can be difficult and researchers may choose from a multitude of different approaches. 
Methods: We present a scoping review to identify the methods used to extract race or ethnicity from Twitter datasets. We searched 16 electronic databases and carried out reference checking in order to identify relevant articles. Sifting of each record was undertaken independently by at least two researchers with any disagreement discussed. The research could be grouped by the methods applied to extract race or ethnicity.
Results: From 1093 records we identified 56 that met our inclusion criteria. The majority focus on Twitter users based in the US. A range of types of data were used including Twitter profile -pictures, bios, and/or location, and the content in the tweets themselves. The methods used were wide ranging and included using manual inference, linkage to census data, commercial software, language/dialect recognition and machine learning. Not all studies evaluated their methods. Those that did found accuracy to vary from 45% to 93% with significantly lower accuracy identifying non-white race categories. There may be some ethical questions over some of the methods used, particularly using photos or dialect, as well as questions surrounding accuracy.
Conclusion: There is no standard approach or guidelines for extracting race or ethnicity from Twitter or other social media. Social media researchers must use careful interpretation of race or ethnicity and not over-promise what can be achieved, as even manual screening is a subjective, imperfect method. Future research should establish the accuracy of methods to inform evidence-based best practice guidelines for social media researchers, and be guided by concerns of equity and social justice.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-14T00:35:25.235237,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T00:34:55.200630,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Su Golder,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/citation/,wru5q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6027f541d6a432024ff0dd5c/,6027f541d6a432024ff0dd5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wru5q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wru5q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wru5q,NA

A crosslinguistic analysis will be provided and a discussion on how de functions within the phrase is set up.

In so doing, we contextualize the analysis of university rankings within a broader sociology of rankings. We identify two dimensions along which such contextualization could be done: (a) systematic, referring to the comparison of university rankings with rankings in other fields and focusing on how university rankings can be informed by insights from other empirical settings; and (b) historical, which concerns long-term trajectories, rather than just the past few years.

The uptake of electric vehicles on a mass scale requires the simultaneous adoption of such vehicles for private and commercial purposes. Although literature regarding the private sphere is consistent, there is comparatively less empirical research seeking to explain the factors that enable and hinder the uptake of electric vehicles at a commercial level at which fleet managers have a prominent role. Based on an empirical survey conducted in Italy, this paper investigates the role of technical and financial information in fleet managersâ€™ procurement decision-making. Results suggest a lack of awareness regarding technical characteristics of vehicles, given that 59% of the fleet managers surveyed scored low to medium. Furthermore, a misalignment related to the expected investment payback period was observed, considering that 49% declared that they expect a payback period within three years. Given that exposure to electric vehicles within fleets constitutes an incentive for private purchase, well-designed policies for corporate fleetsâ€™ electrification would lead to remarkable growth of the electric vehicles  market.",TRUE,FALSE,corporate fleet|decarbonization|electric cars|electric vehicles|fleet management|green economy|survey,2021-02-14T00:39:02.851425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T00:38:42.015784,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/citation/,b3e56,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6027b67873c9fe026c0766eb/,6027b67873c9fe026c0766eb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b3e56/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b3e56,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rtbm.2021.100627

To hedge against this risk of biased omissions, one would need an exhaustive list of major scientific presses and their journals. Such an inclusive catalogue, however, does not exist yet. This paper explores whether webscraping multiple heterogeneous research-related platforms could fill this gap. In a first step, the project draws from the content coverages of Scopus, Publons, DOAJ and SherpaRomeo to extract a preliminary list of publishers that supposedly possess at least 30 journals. In a second step, the project scrapes each of the publisherâ€™s website to fetch their respective journal portfolios. The outcome is a list of 137 publishers comprising 25.816 journals. Many of the publishers, especially those that operate outside the U.S. and Western Europe, would have been overlooked if one had drawn from merely one or two sources. The catalogue can thus be deemed comprehensive, inclusive and diverse.

The onset of parenthood is likely to be a key event that affects expectations. This paper explores whether the expectations of women who have only one child (one child women) change in the five years before and after first birth, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (USA) and Understanding Society (UK). We aim to determine whether one child women are distinct in their expectations from women who go on to higher parities even before first birth, and whether the event of first birth is a catalyst for changing expectations. 
Our results show that, in both contexts, one child women expect closer to two children prior to, compared to after, first birth, when the trajectory declines more steeply towards one. One child women also expect fewer than higher parity mothers by the time of first birth.

The current study aimed to identify social ecological factors related to loneliness and examine the extent to which geographic region accounts for differences in loneliness.

Methods: The data come from a cross-sectional sample of 6503 young people living in the United Kingdom. Loneliness was measured using the UCLA 3-item scale. Bivariate analyses were used to test associations between each predictor and loneliness. Multilevel models were used to identify key social ecological factors related to loneliness, and the extent to which loneliness varied across geographic regions. 

Results: Socio-demographic, social, health and wellbeing, and community factors were found to be associated with loneliness. Geographic region accounted for 5-8% of the variation in loneliness. The effect of gender, sexual orientation, and minority ethnic background on loneliness differed across geographic regions. 

Conclusions: This is the first study to highlight modifiable social and community factors related to youth loneliness, and individual vulnerabilities, such as poor mental wellbeing. Results related to geographic differences suggest that local-level initiatives may be most appropriate in tackling loneliness, rather than wider, less contextualized national efforts.",TRUE,FALSE,geographical|lonelines|multilevel modelling|social ecological|young people,2021-02-14T00:21:50.045850,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T00:21:25.446898,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/citation/,ns2te,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6026760073c9fe01f6077ea7/,6026760073c9fe01f6077ea7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ns2te/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ns2te/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ns2te,NA

Following up on the literature on the long-term effects of precolonial institutions in Africa, we investigate whether today's traditional institutions mirror their precolonial predecessors. We link new data on traditional institutions of African ethnic groups with Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas. We find a robust association between past and present levels of centralization. However, this persistence originates almost exclusively from former British colonies governed with more reliance on precolonial institutions than other colonies, in particular French ones. These findings contribute to research on the development and effects of traditional institutions, highlighting the need to theoretically and empirically differentiate between what we call institutional persistence and persistent effects of past institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Colonial legacies|Institutional persistence|Long-term effects|Murdock|Precolonial institutions|Traditional institutions,2021-02-14T00:15:42.282078,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T00:15:29.847197,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/citation/,kw32s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6026349773c9fe01d107d6b7/,6026349773c9fe01d107d6b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw32s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw32s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw32s,NA
