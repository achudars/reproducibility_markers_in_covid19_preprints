Physical housing and household composition have an important role in the lives of individuals and drive health and social outcomes, and inequalities. Most methods to understand housing composition are based on survey or census data, and there is currently no reproducible methodology for creating population-level household composition measures using linked administrative data.
Methods
Using existing, and more recent enhancements to the address-data linkage methods in the SAIL Databank using Residential Anonymised Linking Fields we linked individuals to properties using the anonymised Welsh Demographic Service data in the SAIL Databank. We defined households, household size, and household composition measures based on adult to child relationships, and age differences between residents to create relative age measures.
Results
Two relative age-based algorithms were developed and returned similar results when applied to population and household-level data, describing household composition for 3.1 million individuals within 1.2 million households in Wales. Developed methods describe binary, and count level generational household composition measures.
Conclusions
Improved residential anonymised linkage field methods in SAIL have led to improved property-level data linkage, allowing the design and application of household composition measures that assign individuals to shared residences and allow the description of household composition across Wales. The reproducible methods create longitudinal, household-level composition measures at a population-level using linked administrative data. Such measures are important to help understand more detail about an individual’s home and area environment and how that may affect the health and wellbeing of the individual, other residents, and potentially into the wider community.",TRUE,FALSE,Data Linkage|Demography|Electronic Health Records|Household composition|UPRN,2020-12-08T05:48:43.796979,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-08T05:48:11.648705,FALSE,NA,no,"The data used in this study are available in the SAIL Databank at Swansea University, Swansea, UK.

Work exit is defined as involuntary based on the reasons of exit. Four different types of institutional factors, push and pull, aiming for an earlier work exit and need and maintain factors to retain older workers in employment are considered. Using data from 15 European countries from the longitudinal Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), discrete- time event history models with a categorical outcome are estimated for each country separately. In a second step, we add macro-level indicators and conduct meta-analyses to analyze country differences. Results show that in almost all countries a social gradient in involuntary work exit exists but not in voluntary exit. Lower-educated workers are more likely to involuntarily exit the labor market. Institutional factors, especially those supporting older workers’ retention in employment, are associated with a smaller social gradient in work exit. Our findings suggest that investments in active labor market expenditures, especially in lifelong learning and rehabilitation for lower educated workers, may help to reduce the social gradient in involuntary work exit.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-08T05:48:21.923197,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-08T05:47:44.265947,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9J56G,no,,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/citation/,gdtcp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9j56g/,9j56g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fce5410aa60b80379897009/,5fce5410aa60b80379897009,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdtcp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gdtcp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gdtcp

This is one of the most debated aspects of social assistance receipt. This study analyses duration dependence among young adults in Finland and aims to show how social assistance receipt per se affects the likelihood of exiting social assistance. It also examines whether parental recipiency is associated with duration dependence. While the intergenerational transmission of social assistance has received extensive research attention, there is a scarcity of evidence on whether parental recipiency is associated with social assistance exits and duration effects. This study uses full monthly history of social assistance receipt between ages 19 and 29. The analyses are based on Finnish register data and conducted using discrete-time event-history models (pooled logistic, random-effect logistic and fixed-effect logistic). The findings indicate that controlling for all time-invariant characteristics reduces but does not completely remove duration dependence among young adults. They also show that those whose parents received social assistance are less likely to exit social assistance. In models controlling for all time-invariant characteristics, parental social assistance receipt is also linked with stronger duration dependence.

Anspach),"The Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville was one of the most widely read works of the early Middle Ages, as is evidenced by the number of surviving manuscripts. August Eduard Anspach’s handlist from the 1940s puts their number at almost 1,200, of which approximately 300 were estimated to have been copied before the year 1000. This article, based on a new manuscript survey of the early medieval manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae, brings the number of known surviving pre-1000 manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae to almost 450. Of these, 84 well-preserved codices and 24 fragments contain the canonical Etymologiae, i.e., they reflect the integral transmission of Isidore’s work as an encyclopedia, while 300 well-preserved codices and 21 fragments reflect the selective or non-canonical transmission of the Etymologiae, principally not as an encyclopedia. Due to the uneven survival rates of manuscripts of canonical and non-canonical Etymologiae, it seems likely that the latter accounted for perhaps as much as 80-90% of manuscripts transmitting Isidore’s work before the year 1000. Four non-canonical formats emerge as having been particularly influential in the early Middle Ages: the separate transmission of the first book of the Etymologiae as an ars grammatica; the compilation of various catechetical collections, sometimes in question-and-answer form, from books VI, VII, and VIII of the Etymologiae; the incorporation of material from books V and IX into law collections; and the incorporation of segments from books III, V, VI, and XIII into computistic manuals. The surviving manuscripts suggest that the latter format emerged in the insular world, while the others are more distinctly Carolingian. Northern France and northern Italy emerge as the two most important regional hubs of the copying of the Etymologiae in the ninth and tenth centuries. While in the former region, non-canonical formats seem to have been the most important vehicle of the transmission of material from Isidore’s work, in the latter, the canonical format may have been more influential, indicating that there existed regional differences in the reception of the Etymologiae.",TRUE,FALSE,early Middle Ages|encyclopaedia|Etymologiae|Isidore of Seville|manuscript studies|manuscript transmission|medieval manuscripts,2020-12-07T09:30:41.178359,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-07T09:29:11.247611,FALSE,NA,no,The data will be made available in the future (2021).,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d21|Arts and Humanities|Medieval Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/citation/,86ap4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/szfrq/,szfrq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fcdf06e4269db037f1c4bb6/,5fcdf06e4269db037f1c4bb6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86ap4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/86ap4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/86ap4

How does semantic precision evolve, and what are the constraints that limit it? We studied the evolution of semantic conventions, in the form of variable mappings between symbols and their referents, in a multiplayer gaming app built around a referential communication game, where a sender had to indicate a colour to a receiver, using only black and white symbols. We expected that the players’ mappings between symbols and colours would grow more specific over time, precision being measured as sense entropy, through a selection process whereby precise mappings are preferentially copied. We found that players become increasingly more precise in their use of symbols over the course of their careers. This trend did not, however, result from selective copying of precise mappings.

Participants took part in a referential communication task where a Sender had to indicate a colour to a Receiver, with the help of black and white symbols. They could freely choose which other players they interacted with, and play repeatedly with their chosen contacts. This paper presents the Color Game dataset, accessible at https://osf.io/9yc25/, which records all interactions between app players.

Using the 2016 wave of the Panel Study of Family Dynamics (PSFD), gender differences in the extent to which top-down (trait positive and negative affect) and bottom-up (demographic, financial, and social support) factors predicted financial satisfaction were explored within three Taiwanese social contexts: all adults (n=3,593), working adults (n=2,713), and married working adults (n=1,306). Varied gender differences were observed across all three social contexts. In particular, income (more strongly associated among men than women), education (more strongly associated among women than men), and trait negative affect (more strongly associated among women than men) tended to predict financial satisfaction differently by gender. Trait positive affect predicted financial satisfaction regardless of gender. The present analysis suggests traditional breadwinner ideologies continue to influence financial satisfaction assessment in Taiwan.",TRUE,FALSE,Dispositional affect|Emotion|Financial satisfaction|Gender differences|Taiwan|Trait affect,2020-12-07T09:32:00.870405,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-07T09:31:04.383303,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://psfd.sinica.edu.tw/web/plan_01en.htm,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,Derek T.

fundamentals during uncertain times. To evaluate this idea, we develop a novel measure of linguistic imprecision based on sentences marked with the \weasel tag"" on Wikipedia. For a 10-week window following the 10-K disclosure, we ?nd that the use of imprecise language in 10-Ks predicts 1) positive and non-reverting abnormal returns, 2) improvements to stock liquidity, 3) greater intensities of insider and informed buying, and 4) higher news sentiment. These fi?ndings are the strongest when the fi?rm disclosures are more forward looking, and for fi?rms with greater idiosyncratic volatility.
