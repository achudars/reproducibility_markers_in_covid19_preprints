Education is centre stage here because it is one of the main prerequisites for social and economic integration. While research indicates that migrant educational underachievement is a serious issue, relatively little is known about when, how and why migrant gaps develop. More research is also still needed on the educational performance of immigrant children at younger ages and in relatively new immigration countries. The current study sets out to estimate the size of the performance gap between Irish children with and without a migration background at age 5 (i.e., at the age they start school) and to explore the causes of these gaps. It does so in a context that offers a compelling but under-researched case: the Republic of Ireland. It draws on the Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) data, a national longitudinal study of children in Ireland. The results suggest that some migration-related disparities already exist at the start of primary school, but also that gaps are limited to verbal skills and that they differ widely across groups. Moreover, social background only plays a relatively minor role in explaining the differences. The language spoken at home, on the other hand, is a powerful predictor for migrant disadvantage.",TRUE,FALSE,Achievement|Growing up in Ireland|Migrant Gap|Migration background|Republic of Ireland|School starting age,2021-03-17T16:50:44.339521,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T16:50:26.901726,FALSE,NA,no,"Growing Up in Ireland datasets are made available to researchers on a confidential and anonymised basis through the Irish Social Sciences Data Archive.

Although separated by Tibet, the muqam tradition of Xinjiang might be found in Kachin music due to myths of Kachin origin, as well as linguistic similarities, e.g., the Kachin term 'makan' for a musical piece. Extractions were performed using the apollon and COMSAR (Computational Music and Sound Archiving) frameworks, on which the Ethnographic Sound Recordings Archive (ESRA) is based, using ethnographic recordings from ESRA next to additional pieces. In terms of pitch, tonal systems were compared using Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), which clearly clusters Kachin and Uyghur musical pieces. This is mainly caused by the Xinjiang muqam music showing just fifth and fourth, while Kachin pieces tend to have a higher fifth and fourth, next to other dissimilarities. Also, the timbre features of spectral centroid and spectral sharpness standard deviation clearly tells Uyghur from Kachin pieces, where Uyghur music shows much larger deviations.

The theory of monopolistic competition teaches that businesses respond to low-cost entry into their markets, and the cutthroat competition it creates, by differentiating their products, sometimes in legitimate ways, but sometimes through deceit. Misinformation on the Internet has the same source: speakers using deceit to compete for attention in a highly competitive speech market. The solution, as in all cases of ruinous competition, is to replace the falling technological barriers to market entry that have given rise to the excessive competition with new legal barriers to entry.
------&gt;The way to create legal barriers to online speech is not to license speech, an approach that would violate the First Amendment, but rather to treat the Internet like a brick-and-mortar postal system. In the United States, the Postal Service enjoys a “letter-box monopoly:” the exclusive right to place mail in mailboxes. This exclusivity gives the Postal Service the power to charge a price—postage—for each communication delivered to an American mailbox. The U.S. Congress—or the Postal Service itself through reinterpretation of existing law—should give the Postal Service a letter-box monopoly on social media posting: the exclusive right to charge a fee for every Tweet, Facebook post, or other social media missive delivered in America. That would greatly increase the cost of being heard on the Internet, for as the number of a poster’s followers increases, the total cost of social media “postage” would increase as well, reducing competition and the incentive to misinform. Because the letter-box monopoly has survived constitutional scrutiny for two centuries, this approach would necessarily survive First Amendment scrutiny as well.",TRUE,FALSE,competition|fake news|first amendment|letter-box monopoly|misinformation|news industry|newspapers|postal service|price regulation|product differentiation|ruinous competition,2021-03-17T03:32:46.700735,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T03:32:19.942223,TRUE,This research was funded in part by a grant from the John S. and James L.

Using a multilayer network approach, I explore the relationship between official and track two diplomacy in the Asia Pacific region using a new network data set constructed from diplomatic meeting records.

Making data meaningfully accessible requires that scholars take the appropriate steps to prepare their data for sharing, and avail themselves of the increasingly sophisticated infrastructure for publishing and preserving research data. The better other researchers can understand shared data and the more researchers who can access them, the more those data will be re-used for secondary analysis, producing knowledge. Likewise, the richer an understanding an instructor and her students can gain of the shared data being used to teach and learn a particular research method, the more useful those data are for that pedagogical purpose.

Naturally, there is some inter-dependence among impact measures. A study’s citation-count is apt to be influenced by a journal’s citation-count, for example.

Other behaviours compensate for negative environmental impacts of their vacation, for example: purchasing carbon offsets for a flight. 
Despite their best intentions, however, people do not behave as environmentally friendly on vacation as they do at home (Dolnicar and Grün, 2009): 46% of consumers intend to purchase carbon offsets, but only 6% (Mair, 2011) or 7% (Dawson, Stewart, Lemelin and Scott’s, 2010) actually do purchase them. Intention-behaviour gaps range from 12% (Sloan and Adamsen, 2011), 22% (Juvan and Dolnicar, 2016), and 46% (Karlsson and Dolnicar, 2016) to as much as 76% (McKercher and Prideaux, 2011).

These methods can illuminate the unobservable histories of cultural traits and identify the evolutionary drivers of trait-change over time, but their application is not without pitfalls. Here we outline the current scope of research in cultural tree thinking, highlighting a toolkit of best practices to navigate and avoid the pitfalls and ‘abuses’ associated with their application. We emphasise two principles that support the appropriate application of phylogenetic methodologies in cross-cultural research: researchers should (1) draw on multiple lines of evidence when deciding if and which types of phylogenetic methods and models are suitable for their cross-cultural data, and (2) carefully consider how different cultural traits might have different evolutionary histories across space and time. When used appropriately phylogenetic methods can provide powerful insights into the processes of evolutionary change that have shaped the broad patterns of human history.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-16T08:02:24.708759,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-16T08:01:38.029714,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/citation/,a8v3e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604fbbbb474b1e0286ca42ba/,604fbbbb474b1e0286ca42ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8v3e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a8v3e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a8v3e,NA

This key insight of both Polanyi and Ruggie has been neglected in the Polanyi-inspired debate on the social consequences of European integration. Focusing on the European Court of Justice and the European Commission as the supranational enforcers of the legal logic of integration, the literature has paid insufficient attention to the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) as the supranational enforcer of the economic logic of integration since monetary union. While Polanyi conceptualized central banking as an institution of non-market coordination that evolved to protect the domestic economy from gold standard pressures, the ECB has acted as an enforcer of disembedding “euro standard” pressures vis-`a-vis national labor market and welfare state institutions. Performing a mixed-methods analysis of public speeches, parliamentary hearings, central bank publications, and interviews with senior decision-makers, we provide the first comprehensive study of the ECB’s advocacy of structural reforms during the period 1999–2019. Despite lacking the mandate or the authority to override national legislation, the ECB, strategically pursuing its organizational and systemic interests, pushed for structural reforms via discursive advocacy and conditionality. Our results show that Europe’s prospects for Polanyian non-market coordination are determined by Frankfurt as much as by Luxembourg and Brussels.",TRUE,FALSE,euro area|European Central Bank|Karl Polanyi|labor market policy|monetary integration|social protection,2021-03-16T08:01:04.137037,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-16T08:00:17.785749,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,The authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/citation/,dp3nv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604fb98936e58b02a6bc0c23/,604fb98936e58b02a6bc0c23,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp3nv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dp3nv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dp3nv,NA
