Thus, through the diagnostic SES framework analysis, this paper aims to investigate what and how the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affect the success level of 7 selected Asia-Pacific countries (namely South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and New Zealand) in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on secondary data from February 2020 to June 2020, the success or severity level of a country was measured by cumulative positive cases, average daily increase, and the mortality rate. A qualitative content analysis, covering code assignation, i.e., Present (P), Partially Present (PP), Absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as rank ordering (from 1st to 7th) and score calculation (from 3 to 21) for the success level between the countries, was undertaken. Attributes (design principles) of SES factors, such as past experiences facing similar diseases, facilities mobility, lockdown measures, penalty, and standard of procedures in public spaces are deemed significant in determining the abatement outcome or severity of a country. The findings show that Vietnam (1st) and New Zealand (2nd) adopting most of the design principles of governance (with the scores of 15 and above) had successfully eliminated the virus, while Indonesia (7th) and Japan (6th) were deemed least successful (scoring between 3-9), likely due to the low presence frequency of design principles. Not only does the study validate SES framework adaptability in a health-related (non-commons) setting, where some design principles used in resource/commons governance are also relevant in explaining the COVID-19 outcome, the critical attributes of institutional-social-ecological factors are highlighted, ultimately helping policymakers devise more strategic measures to address the crisis",TRUE,FALSE,Asia-Pacific|Coronavirus|Design Principles|Institutional-social-ecological system|SES,2020-11-09T04:16:21.084904,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-09T04:16:11.713991,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",Gabriel Hoh Teck Ling,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/citation/,khe42,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa3c8a4a5bb9d01230a02d3/,5fa3c8a4a5bb9d01230a02d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/khe42/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/khe42,NA

We argue that the adoption of this doctrine by the Roman Catholic Church, when combined with an increase in screening of candidates to the priesthood, may have been an optimal response to changing historical circumstances. The historical evidence supports the hypothesis that the development of the ""in persona Christi Capitis"" doctrine was accompanied by marginal increases in the screening of priestly candidates by the Roman CatholicChurch.

This study examined the COVID-19 virus infection fears in a survey sample of 4,200 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the confinement period of June 21-26, 2020 and collected by Statistics Canada. A marketing segmentation analysis was carried out using a roster of 13 perceived health risks items leading to the identification of typical fears and the profiling of five major segments present in the Canadian adult population: ""Germophobes"" (7%), ""Crowd-Averse"" (34%), ""Fearless"" (17%), ""Outside ""Bubble""-Averse"" (18%), and """"Nursing Homes-Averse"" (24%). Health risk  items included a wide range of preoccupations such as visiting retirement homes, travelling by car or airplane, attending public events, shopping, eating out, seeing doctors and/or participating in sports or gyms. The five population segments were identified using a combination of principal component and k-means cluster statistical analysis.

Information, data and materials which are the basis for decisions made by policy and strategy makers are acquired from a vast and chaotic mixture of sources. Those are produced based on opinions of experts from diverse fields, results of statistical or clinical studies, official or covert economic interests, political opinions or media pressure and many more inputs. This study presents a concrete example of a possible instrument for correction for the influence of the potentially misleading view in media or society.

Methods: Using a questionnaire, this study heuristically quantifies the perceptions of a selected group of Faculty of Science, Palacký University Olomouc employees towards the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. We presume that overall they possess more experience with critical analysis and recognizing the relevance of the data than the general population.

Results: The respondents assume that based on the data they believe to be relevant COVID-19 is less than or comparably dangerous as seasonal flu (34.1 %) or several times or by an order of magnitude more dangerous (54,1 %); implementing wearing face covering inside is in total for the population rather beneficial (83,8 %), or disadvantageous or without any significance (7,5 %), the daily count of infected is relevant (49,7 %), or irrelevant (42,2 %); the exposure rate in the population is relevant (55,2 %), or irrelevant (34,0 %); the percentage of the Czech population that has already been exposed to the virus is 5% or less (46,5 %), or 6% or more (29,2 %). The respondents view the government measures as relevant and sufficient or insufficient (58,9 %), or relevant but excessive (20,0 %), or irrelevant and excessive or absurd (9,2 %). A significant amount of further data has been derived from the results presented in this study.

Conclusion: Certain results of the perceptions quantification reflect the predominant media discourse (such as the question of the benefit of wearing face coverings inside), other seem to differ or contradict the discourse (such as the comparison with seasonal flu or the preference for the exposure data over the daily infected count). As a conclusion, it can be ascertained that when correctly implemented a verified survey of a predefined closed group of respondents can be an applicable instrument for a potential correction for the prevailing public and media paradigm.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19 Czech Republic|Faculty of science UPOL|survay as a tool in public health,2020-11-05T13:10:25.005129,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-05T13:09:02.977431,FALSE,NA,no,The data are available from the authors upon request.,,no,-,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Pavel Rušar; Radim Kapavík,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/citation/,8zdxk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa288ad23568c0088d68593/,5fa288ad23568c0088d68593,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8zdxk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8zdxk,NA

Identifying precisely when and where expedient bone tools were used in prehistory nonetheless remains a challenging task owing to the multiple natural and anthropogenic processes that can mimic deliberately knapped bones. Here, we compare a large sample of the faunal remains from Lingjing, a 115 ka-old site from China which has yielded important hominin remains and rich faunal and lithic assemblages, with bone fragments produced by experimentally fracturing Equus caballus long bones. Our results provide a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria that can help zooarchaeologists and bone technologists distinguish faunal remains with intentional flake removal scars from those resulting from carcass processing activities. Experimental data shows marrow extraction seldom generates diaphyseal fragments bearing more than six flake scars arranged contiguously or in interspersed series. Long bone fragments presenting such characteristics can, therefore, be interpreted as being purposefully knapped to be used as expediency tools. The identification, based on the above experimental criteria, of 56 bone tools in the Lingjing faunal assemblage is consistent with the smaller size of the lithics found in the same layer. The continuity gradient observed in the size of lithics and knapped bones suggests the latter were used for tasks in which the former were less or not effective.",TRUE,FALSE,Bone Tools|Cultural evolution|early Late Pleistocene|Experimental Archaeology|Taphonomy,2020-11-04T11:21:56.948294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-04T11:21:20.727318,FALSE,NA,no,The data is included in the manuscript and the SI.

Whereas the absence of posted prices opens the door for price discrimination based on some buyers' attributes, the reduction in quality over time might decrease prices to secure a transaction. We use an audit experiment to detect these pricing patterns in the informal flower markets nearby the cemeteries of Bogotá, Colombia. We analyze 441 price quotations. We interpret the lower prices in the afternoon than in the morning as evidence of dynamic pricing. Regarding price discrimination, we find that women are quoted a higher price than men, whereas attire (formal versus informal) does not affect prices. The price variations associated with the time of the day and the gender of the buyer appear to be independent of each other.",TRUE,FALSE,audit study|dual labor markets|informal markets,2020-11-04T11:25:21.732017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-04T11:24:51.637387,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available with publication.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/citation/,pv5kz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa1b3f99c4dcb003ee46b64/,5fa1b3f99c4dcb003ee46b64,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv5kz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pv5kz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pv5kz,NA
