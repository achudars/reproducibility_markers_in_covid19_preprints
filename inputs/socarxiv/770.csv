law serves its proper purpose of encouraging market exchange and lowering
consumer search costs. As we have explained in detail elsewhere, the
doctrine ensures that trademarks do not become a weapon used to suppress
speech or to interfere with rather than promote the efficient operation of
the marketplace.

Those goals are even more important in the context of trademark dilution.
Unlike a normal cause of action for trademark infringement, trademark
dilution gives broader rights to a few famous mark owners to prevent even
non-confusing uses in order to protect the uniqueness of their marks
against blurring and tarnishment. But because trademark dilution can exist
even when goods do not compete, and even absent any likelihood of
confusion, it is even more critical that the universe of actions that can
give rise to dilution be cabined by a clear and effective trademark use
doctrine.

The Lanham Act has had a trademark use limitation on dilution since the
first dilution legislation was enacted in 1996, but recent amendments have
changed the language and scope of that limitation, leading to some
confusion about what is and is not protected. In this article, we parse the
language and legislative history of the 2006 Trademark Dilution Revision

categorical rules or broad, open-ended standards that allow for
case-specific adjudication. Antitrust law is generally thought of as
inhabiting the standards end of this spectrum. In fact, however, despite
the generality of the enabling statutes antitrust law is rife with
categorical distinctions.

In Part I, we explore not only the well-known distinction between conduct
that is per se illegal and conduct judged under the rule of reason, but
also a number of categorical distinctions the courts draw, either to help
delineate the scope of the per se rule or to create distinctions within the
scope of the rule of reason itself. By and large these rules don't come
from the antitrust statutes. They are created by courts, who are in effect
converting case-specific standards en masse into categorical rules.

In Part II, we identify a number of problems with these distinctions. One
problem is administrative: courts spend a great deal of time trying to
parse conduct in order to put it on one side or another of the lines they
have created. Indeed, in many cases courts spend more time on
categorization than they do on actual economic analysis of the case itself.
Second, judicial antitrust categories are subject to manipulation. Parties
go to great lengths to fit into a box that will give them more favorable
treatment, sometimes by legal argument, sometimes by restructuring a
transaction, and sometimes by concealing or misrepresenting the facts of
that transaction. Third, a number of the categories the courts have created
make no sense, whether because they have lost their meaning over time,
because their boundaries have eroded, because they actually tell us very
little of relevance to the competitive effects of the transaction, or
because they are simply dumb. The net result is a mess. Categories have
become conclusions, displacing the fact-specific economic analysis in which
antitrust law is supposed to be engaging.

In Part III, we argue that there is a better way. We evaluate the costs and
benefits of the judicial creation of categories, and contend that the
complex of antitrust boxes the courts have created today does more harm
than good. We don't mean to suggest there is no value to categories, and
that everything must be thrown into a pure cost-benefit analysis. Some
rules (the per se rule against price fixing, for instance) make sense.
Rather, the important thing is to make sure that the categories we use have
empirical support, and that they are communicating valuable information to
courts about the competitive effects of a general practice. We think the
courts have gone too far in the creation of rules in a variety of cases.
Finally, we suggest that courts make more use than they do of certain tools
- the doctrine of direct economic effect and empirical evidence - as
powerful filters for distinguishing good from bad antitrust claims.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:50.001006,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T18:48:22.533000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/citation/,x2k97,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/psyyz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/relationships/node/,psyyz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c08efa6c613b01fb8d66df/,57c08efa6c613b01fb8d66df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2k97/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x2k97/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x2k97

this reason, the fundamental requirement for getting a patent is that you
have invented something new.

It is curious, then, that patent law itself purports to pay no attention to
which aspects of a patentee’s invention are in fact new. A patented
invention is legally defined by its claims – written definitions of the
invention. And those written definitions virtually never call out what it
is that is new about the patentee’s invention.

Even if the parties do identify the novel element of an invention, the law
purports not to care. Long-standing patent law doctrine has decried any
focus on the “point of novelty” of an invention. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit evaluates the claim as a whole, not just
the piece of the claim that the patentee actually added to the storehouse
of knowledge. As the court frequently puts it, “there is no legally
recognizable . . . ‘gist’ or ‘heart’ of the invention.”

It turns out, however, to be hard to sustain a rule that a law concerned
with novelty will pay no attention to the point of novelty. And so
point-of-novelty issues crop up in a number of different doctrines in
patent law, from figuring out who counts as an inventor to whether the
inventor has disclosed the “best mode” of practicing the invention to when
the sale of a product exhausts the patentee’s rights in the patent. Courts
are inconsistent in whether and how they consider the point of novelty in
these doctrines and more. But when the Federal Circuit presented with a
question in point-of-novelty terms, it most often falls back on the mantra
that there is no point of novelty to an invention, even if it means
discarding long-standing precedent.

It’s time to rethink the no-point-of-novelty doctrine in patent law. I
argue that ignoring what is novel about patentee’s invention makes little
sense as an across-the-board matter, and leads to a variety of harmful
consequences. While refusing to focus on the point of novelty serves some
valuable purposes, there are other ways to achieve those ends. And in the
end, a patent regime that pays attention to what the patentee actually
invented, not what the patent lawyer wrote down, is more likely to achieve
the goal of promoting innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:42.042746,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T18:46:07.401000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/citation/,mbf6w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y7dk7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/relationships/node/,y7dk7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c08e70594d90020b358a61/,57c08e70594d90020b358a61,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbf6w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mbf6w

Government regulation may or may not promote either competition or
efficiency, depending on both the goals of the agency and the effects of
industry ""capture."" Antitrust courts have long included regulated
industries within their purview, working to ensure that regulated
industries could not use the limits that regulation imposes on the normal
competitive process to achieve anticompetitive ends. Doing so makes sense;
an antitrust law that ignored anticompetitive behavior in any regulated
industry would be a law full of holes.

The role of antitrust in policing regulated industries appears to be
changing, however. A cluster of Supreme Court decisions in the past decade
have fundamentally altered the relationship between antitrust and
regulation, placing antitrust law in a subordinate relationship that, some
have argued, requires it to defer not just to regulatory decisions but
perhaps even to the silence of regulatory agencies in their areas of
expertise.

Absolute antitrust deference to regulatory agencies makes little sense as a
matter either of economics or experience. Economic theory teaches that
antitrust courts are better equipped than regulators to assure efficient
outcomes in many circumstances. Public choice theory - and long experience
- suggests that agencies that start out trying to limit problematic
behavior by industries often end up condoning that behavior and even
insulating those industries from market forces. And as history has shown,
relying on regulatory oversight alone without the backdrop of antitrust law
would leave both temporal and substantive gaps in enforcement, which
unscrupulous competitors could exploit to the clear detriment of consumers.
The mere existence of a competition-conscious regulatory structure cannot
guarantee against abuses of that structure, or against exclusionary
behavior that falls just beyond its jurisdiction. Indeed - and perhaps
ironically - the very regulatory structure that exists to promote
competition can create gaming opportunities for competitors bent on
achieving anti-competitive goals. Such ""regulatory gaming"" undermines both
the regulatory system itself and the longstanding complementary
relationship between regulatory and antitrust law.

We argue that the risk of regulatory gaming provides an important example
of the need for ongoing antitrust oversight of regulated industries. We
define regulatory gaming as private behavior that harnesses pro-competitive
or neutral regulations and uses them for exclusionary purposes. We identify
three possible instances of regulatory gaming: (1) product-hopping, in
which the branded company makes repeated changes in drug formulation to
prevent generic substitution, rather than to improve the efficacy of the
drug product; (2) manipulation of government standard-setting
organizations; and (3) claims of price squeezes by partially regulated
industries.

Our goal in this paper is not to persuade the reader that these particular
examples of regulatory gaming do or do not violate the antitrust laws.
Rather, our point is that whether or not particular acts of regulatory
gaming harm competition is and should be an antitrust question, not merely
one that involves interpreting statutes or agency regulations. Some level
of antitrust enforcement - with appropriate deference to firm decisions
about product design and affirmative regulatory decisions that affect
market conditions - provides a necessary check on behavior, such as product
hopping, that has no purpose but to exclude competition.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:08.921870,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T18:42:33.442000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/citation/,sta5b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3mujd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/relationships/node/,3mujd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c08d9ab83f6901fcc4a577/,57c08d9ab83f6901fcc4a577,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sta5b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sta5b

private non-profit company which, pursuant to contracts with the US

what TLDs will be made available to users, and which registrars will be
permitted to offer those TLDs for sale. In this article we focus on a
hitherto-neglected implication of ICANN's assertion that it is a private
rather than a public actor: its potential liability under the U.S.
antitrust laws, and the liability of those who transact with it. ICANN
argues that it is not as closely tied to the government as NSI and IANA
were in the days before ICANN was created. If this is correct, it seems
likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust immunity those actors
enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain competition, e.g.
its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate that their
proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's
preventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars
(requiring the UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized
as anticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be
subject to the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in
fact violated the antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust
state actor, whether the DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it
can shelter under precedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as
seems likely) a private ICANN and those who petition it are subject to

overshadowed online by the system of intermediary safe harbors enacted as
part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) in 1998. The Internet
safe harbors and the system of notice-and-takedown fundamentally changed
the incentives of platforms, users, and rightsholders in relation to claims
of copyright infringement. These different incentives interact to yield a
functional balance of copyright online that diverges markedly from the
experience of copyright law in traditional media environments. This article
also explores a second divergence: the DMCA’s safe harbor system is being
superseded by private agreements between rightsholders and large commercial
Internet platforms made in the shadow of those safe harbors. These
agreements relate to automatic copyright filtering systems, such as
YouTube’s Content ID, that not only return platforms to their gatekeeping
role, but encode that role in algorithms and software.

The normative implications of these developments are contestable. Fair use
and other axioms of copyright law still nominally apply online; but in
practice, the safe harbors and private agreements made in the shadow of
those safe harbors are now far more important determinants of online
behavior than whether that conduct is, or is not, substantively in
compliance with copyright law. The diminished relevance of substantive
copyright law to online expression has benefits and costs that appear
fundamentally incommensurable. Compared to the offline world, online
platforms are typically more permissive of infringement, and more open to
new and unexpected speech and new forms of cultural participation. However,
speech on these platforms is also more vulnerable to over-reaching claims
by rightsholders. There is no easy metric for comparing the value of
non-infringing expression enabled by the safe harbors to that which has
been unjustifiably suppressed by misuse of the notice-and-takedown system.
Likewise, the harm that copyright infringement does to rightsholders is not
easy to calculate, nor is it easy to weigh against the many benefits of the
safe harbors.

DMCA-plus agreements raise additional considerations. Automatic copyright
enforcement systems have obvious advantages for both platforms and
rightsholders; they may also allow platforms to be more  hospitable to
certain types of user content. However, automated enforcement systems may
also place an undue burden on fair use and other forms of non-infringing
speech. The design of copyright enforcement robots encodes a series of
policy choices made by platforms and rightsholders and, as a result,
subjects online speech and cultural participation to a new layer of private
ordering and private control. In the future, private interests, not public
policy will determine the conditions under which users get to participate
in online platforms that adopt these systems. In a world where
communication and expression is policed by copyright robots, the
substantive content of copyright law matters only to the extent that those
with power decide that it should matter.

requirement - that inventions must, to qualify for a patent, be not simply
new but sufficiently different that they would not have been obvious to the
ordinarily skilled scientist - is in dispute in almost every case, and it
is responsible for invalidating more patents than any other patent rule. It
is also perhaps the most vexing doctrine to apply, in significant part
because the ultimate question of obviousness has an I know it when I see it
quality that is hard to break down into objective elements. That hasn't
stopped the Federal Circuit from trying to find those objective elements.
In the last quarter-century, the court has created a variety of rules
designed to cabin the obviousness inquiry: an invention can't be obvious
unless there is a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art
elements or modify existing technology; an invention can't be obvious
merely because it is obvious to try; and so forth.

In KSR v. Teleflex, the Supreme Court rejected the use of rigid rules to
decide obviousness cases. In its place, the Court offered not a new test,
but a constellation of factors designed to discern whether the person
having ordinary skill in the art (the PHOSITA) would likely think to make
the patented invention. In short, the Court sought to take a realist
approach to obviousness - to make the obviousness determination less of a
legal construct and to put more weight on the factual determination of what
scientists would actually think and do about a particular invention.

As a general principle, this realist focus is a laudable one. The too-rigid
application of rules designed to prevent hindsight bias had led to a number
or results that defied common sense, including the outcome of KSR itself in
the Federal Circuit. But the realist approach has some (dare we say it)
nonobvious implications for evidence and procedure, both in the Patent and
Trademark Office (PTO) and in the courts. The greater focus on the
characteristics of individual cases suggests a need for evidence and
factual determinations, but the legal and structural framework under which
obviousness is tested makes it difficult to make and review those
determinations. The realist approach is also incomplete, because both the
knowledge of the PHOSITA and the way the court approaches so-called
secondary considerations of nonobviousness depend critically on the
counterfactual assumption that the PHOSITA, while ordinarily skilled, is
perfectly informed about the prior art. If we are to take a realist
approach to obviousness, we should make it a consistent approach, so the
ultimate obviousness determination actually reflects what scientists in the
field would actually think. So far, despite KSR, it does not. The result of
taking the realist approach seriously may be - to the surprise of many - a
law of obviousness that is in some respects more favorable to patentability
than the standard it displaced.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:31.789872,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-25T17:08:12.678000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/citation/,942dc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4mnsx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/relationships/node/,4mnsx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bf25fd594d9001fed0e18f/,57bf25fd594d9001fed0e18f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/942dc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/942dc
