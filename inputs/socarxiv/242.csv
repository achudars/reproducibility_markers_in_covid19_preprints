Recent studies have generated a number of algorithms that might estimate node prominence in bipartite graphs with greater accuracy; however, it is unclear how these algorithms perform on real world social networks. To provide a comparison of bipartite centrality algorithms and recommendations regarding their appropriate use cases, this article examines their performance in a real-world network of patient-provider ties. We build on a recent body of research showing that network centrality in patient-provider networks is a promising indicator of prescription drug-seeking. We measure centrality with recently-developed bipartite methods, and we find that BiRank and CoHITS provide significantly more robust measures of prescription drug-seeking and better predictors of subsequent opioid overdose than traditional centrality estimates, including PageRank in a one mode network projection.

By Roderic Beaujot
Abstract:
This book tells the story of Leon and Dorothy Beaujot, their lives on a family farm in Saskatchewan (1945-1985), and the stories of their parents who arrived in Canada from Belgium and France over the period 1892 to 1911. With a focus on earning a living and raising families, these farming families underwent much change that took them from horse and buggy days to increasing specialization and mechanization in agriculture. 

The book starts with a short description of the conditions that allowed for European settlement in Western Canada. Another chapter covers the rise and the almost disappearance of the Saint Hubert community in Saskatchewan, founded in 1885, and settled by immigrants from Belgium, France, and Quebec. In order to compare experiences to those of family members who remained in Europe, short descriptions are also made of the lives of uncles, aunts and first cousins of Leon and Dorothy Beaujot, across the four families of origin: Beaujot, Sénéchaud, Mullie, Smets.",TRUE,FALSE,change in agriculture|church|community|education|family|farm|farming|language|Saskatchewan,2020-06-21T03:17:44.075888,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-21T03:17:28.425525,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/citation/,nzcwe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/28znq/,28znq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eece2a4145b1a010652d8a9/,5eece2a4145b1a010652d8a9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzcwe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nzcwe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nzcwe,NA

However, conservatives have been slow to explain how activist departments capture institutions. In that light, this policy brief reviews two feminist papers that detail institutional capture.

In their Study 1, they found that political participation was related to three higher-order basic values and that these associations were stronger in more democratic countries. The present study attempted a replication using a more rigorous modelling approach. Multilevel structural equation models with latent variables for both participation and basic values replicated the main effects of Self-Transcendence and Conservation values but demonstrated negative effects of Openness values (vs positive in the original study) and positive effects of Self-Enhancement values (vs ambiguous or insignificant in the original study), while cross-level interactions indicated weaker effects of values in more democratic countries (vs the opposite in the original study). These discrepancies appeared mostly due to the original study’s implicit assumption that basic values’ measurement errors were zero.

These policy responses include revisions to Canada’s election law and the creation of a federal task force to monitor and respond to online interference during an election campaign. However, much can still be done to uphold the communications element of electoral integrity, both by government and by other stakeholders including journalists, social media companies, and civil society organizations. 
This article focusses on two related challenges: disinformation and harmful speech online. By ‘‘disinformation,” we refer to intentionally false or deceptive communication to advance political ends. We use the term ‘‘harmful speech” to refer to communication that is abusive, threatening, denigrating, or that incites violence. We clarify the risks that disinformation and harmful speech pose to democratic engagement and democratic processes, and synthesize current research about their creation, circulation, and political impacts. We then examine the current regulatory context in Canada (at the time of writing, February 1, 2019) and highlight gaps. 
We conclude with policy recommendations that would enable the Canadian government, social media platforms and journalism organizations to better understand and reduce the threats to democracy posed by disinformation and harmful speech. These are partly drawn from policies that other countries are pursuing. We call for a three-pronged policy framework: 1) greater enforcement of existing laws, 2) regulation to encourage and help social media platforms address abuses; and 3) improved civil society measures, especially by journalism organizations.

Historically, it has been characterised as a relatively small group based on kinship. It was formed around a core sibling group and distinguished by a norm of equality where herding partners were equals regardless of social status. Moreover, it was informally led by a wealthy and skilful person whose authority was primarily related to herding. One of the critical aspects of the siida was that it was flexible: composition and size changed according to the season, and members were free to join and leave the groups as they saw fit. Comparing the current status of the siida system in the Northern and Southern parts of Norway results from this study show that the main difference between the historical representation of the siida system and today concerns a loss of siida flexibility. Only two herders reported to have changed summer- and winter siida since 2000. Furthermore, while the siida continues to be family-based, leadership is becoming more formal. Nevertheless, while leadership is being formalised, decision-making continues to be influenced by concerns of equality.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|group formation|herding|herding group|nomadic pastoralism|Norway,2020-06-19T19:16:40.606918,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-19T19:16:26.573732,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/citation/,d6hm5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eeb5620145b1a003352ee1a/,5eeb5620145b1a003352ee1a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6hm5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d6hm5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d6hm5,NA

The new Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme in England will reward farmers and land managers with public money for the provision of various public goods, including improved biodiversity, cleaner air and water, healthier soils, and natural hazard protection.  Since the new scheme represents a dramatic shift away from the previous subsidy regime, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has committed to ‘co-designing’ the new policy. To this end, Defra have invited farmers and land managers across England to share their views on what the new policy should look like, running two major online consultations, outreach workshops, and a network of nationwide ‘Test and Trials’ to date. We know, however, from previous research on land manager participation with government that participation can be unequal with a set of ‘usual suspects’ dominating engagement and a substantial group of ‘harder to reach’ stakeholders being less involved. Defra wants 82,500 holdings to participate in the new ELM scheme and thus wide engagement in both design and implementation is crucial. This paper explores why some land managers (focusing on farmers) might be ‘harder to reach’ in the context of ELM, who they might be, and how Defra can improve its forms of engagement to ensure that no-one is excluded from the co-design process. We identify ten different predispositions towards ELM that harder to reach farmers might have and make six recommendations that could help Defra improve ELM co-design and delivery: (1) make engagement worthwhile, (2) offer online engagement activities whilst improving connectivity, (3) reduce bureaucracy, (4) enhance trust through skilled intermediaries, (5) pay farmers promptly, and (6) ensure transitions to the new scheme are well-managed.",TRUE,FALSE,Agriculture Bill|Brexit|Co-design|Hard to reach|Inclusive policy development|Public goods,2020-06-19T19:41:50.666219,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-19T19:41:19.099509,FALSE,NA,no,,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/citation/,k2ahd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eeb274076ebd8002fcd932e/,5eeb274076ebd8002fcd932e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2ahd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k2ahd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k2ahd,NA

It is the transfinite generalization of information and representable by transfinite ordinals. The physical world being in the current of time shares the quality of “choice”. Thus quantum information can be seen as the universal substance of the world serving to describe uniformly future, past, and thus the present as the frontier of time. Future is represented as a coherent whole, present as a choice among infinitely many alternatives, and past as a well-ordering obtained as a result of a series of choices. The concept of quantum information describes the frontier of time, that “now”, which transforms future into past. Quantum information generalizes information from finite to infinite series or collections. The concept of quantum information allows of any physical entity to be interpreted as some nonzero quantity of quantum information. The fundament of quantum information is the concept of ‘quantum bit’, “qubit”. A qubit is a choice among an infinite set of alternatives. It generalizes the unit of classical information, a bit, which refer to a finite set of alternatives. The qubit is also isomorphic to a ball in Euclidean space, in which two points are chosen.",TRUE,FALSE,choice|free will|quantity of quantum information|quantum information|qubit|transfinite generalization of information,2020-06-21T03:30:40.778455,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-21T03:30:20.696047,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/citation/,k4vn9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eeb21fd145b1a0024532a47/,5eeb21fd145b1a0024532a47,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4vn9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k4vn9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k4vn9,NA
