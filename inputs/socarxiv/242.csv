Automated hash-matching and predictive machine learning tools – what we define here as algorithmic moderation systems – are increasingly being deployed to conduct content moderation at scale by major platforms for user-generated content such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. This article provides an accessible technical primer on how algorithmic moderation works; examines some of the existing automated tools used by major platforms to handle copyright infringement, terrorism and toxic speech; and identifies key political and ethical issues for these systems as the reliance on them grows. Recent events suggest that algorithmic moderation has become necessary to manage growing public expectations for increased platform responsibility, safety and security on the global stage; however, as we demonstrate, these systems remain opaque, unaccountable and poorly understood. Despite the potential promise of algorithms or ‘AI’, we show that even ‘well optimized’ moderation systems could exacerbate, rather than relieve, many existing problems with content policy as enacted by platforms for three main reasons: automated moderation threatens to (a) further increase opacity, making a famously non-transparent set of practices even more difficult to understand or audit, (b) further complicate outstand- ing issues of fairness and justice in large-scale sociotechnical systems and (c) re-obscure the fundamentally political nature of speech decisions being executed at scale.",TRUE,FALSE,|algorithms|artificial intelligence|copyright|Platform governance|toxic speech,2020-03-11T17:44:00.939101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-11T17:43:37.273900,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/citation/,fj6pg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gh9va/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/relationships/node/,gh9va,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e68c7e50cd06c008f00278b/,5e68c7e50cd06c008f00278b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj6pg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fj6pg/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951719897945,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fj6pg

The area that has most fascinated researchers – and most challenged policy-makers – is how to regulate peer-to-peer accommodation to avoid negative side effects, without restricting economic benefits (Dolnicar, 2019). Regulations are typically reported as individual case studies at one point in time (Hajibaba &amp; Dolnicar, 2017), yet they continuously evolve, sometimes radically, as in the case of Tasmania (Grimmer et al., 2019). 
This is the first longitudinal investigation of Airbnb regulations. It develops a typology of destinations based on their regulatory reaction to Airbnb, and identifies key regulatory aims, and specific measures for policy makers to achieve those aims. Our study focuses on popular tourist destinations affected by the normalisation of peer-to-peer accommodation: San Francisco, New York, Amsterdam, London, Berlin, Paris, Barcelona, Reykjavik, Vienna, Tokyo and Hobart. These destinations experienced reduced quality of life for residents (Sheppard &amp; Udell, 2016), reduced housing availability (Ferreri &amp; Sanyal, 2018) and affordability (Zale, 2018), a change in the character of neighbourhoods (Zale, 2018), additional competition for hospitality businesses (Davidson &amp; Infranca, 2018), and potential safety risks for guests (Guttentag, 2015). Residents, commercial accommodation providers and local governments reacted by lobbying against Airbnb. Anyone benefitting from Airbnb (hosts, entrepreneurs and councils earning revenue) supported Airbnb's global lobbying campaign. This tension led destinations to introduce formal regulations.
Based on academic publications, media reports and policy documents, we create a chronological summary of regulatory responses and identify generalisable patterns. Four types of responses emerge: regulation and taxation, introduction of a registration system, refinement and modification of regulations, and collaborative initiatives of governments and platform facilitators. We use these responses to track the evolution of Airbnb regulation.",TRUE,FALSE,longitudinal|peer-to-peer|policy|regulation|sharing economy|short-term letting,2020-03-12T16:27:02.047396,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-12T16:23:46.998153,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/citation/,t4nqs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6861840cd06c006c007b78/,5e6861840cd06c006c007b78,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4nqs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t4nqs/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2020.102983,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t4nqs

It is seen ubiquitously through times and spaces that a certain percentage of human population is always musically inclined irrespective of their profession. Music is also an integral part of many social activities humans observe like religious practices, marriages, deaths and what more. Due to the possible presence of Harappan population in Mesopotamia, it may be surmised that a number of Harappan musicians and some of their musical instruments could also have reached there. In this investigation, crucial help could also come from the fact that many a times, names of musical instruments travel with them.

On account of a very likely possibility of such an occurrence, a study of archaeological and Sumerian textual records in Mesopotamia was strongly suggestive of a significant presence of Harappan musicians and musical instruments in Mesopotamia. In fact, study of Sumerian text has shown that about 30 musical terminologies out of a total of nearly 60, in the categories such as names of instruments, singers, names of tunes/songs and even musical notations etc. in Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary are found to be both phonetically and semantically very similar to ancient Indian terms with some “Sumerianization”. The study also demonstrated certain patterns in the way words were sumerianized, suggesting the possibility of active human involvement in the process. The translators or interpreters of Meluhhan language are well known to be present in Mesopotamia through archaeological records. To verify the data, other words were studied based on the patterns obtained from musical terminologies from the areas that are related to Harappan presence in Mesopotamia; which yielded many more positive results. In fact, a total of 90 such words are found till now, which are reported here.

Furthermore, the study of iconography in Mesopotamian archaeological records has also shown very compelling parallels in musical traditions. Importantly, it predicted a possibility of a Harappan lyre, shaped realistically like a bull, that may have travelled from Indus to Mesopotamia and evolved there in local styles in the forms as found in the Royal Cemetery of Ur.",TRUE,FALSE,Harappa|Indus Valley Civilization|Mesopotamia|musical instruments|musicology,2020-03-11T17:42:07.769978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-11T17:41:38.390447,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d17|Arts and Humanities|South and Southeast Asian Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d44|Arts and Humanities|Music|Musicology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d46|Arts and Humanities|Music|Ethnomusicology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/citation/,kce5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e68351b0cd06c0072000861/,5e68351b0cd06c0072000861,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kce5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kce5x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kce5x

After the Supreme Court’s 2008 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, there was great hope that it could be brought to bear on climate change, the most pressing current environmental challenge of our time. Massachusetts was fêted as the most important environmental case ever decided, and upon it the EPA under President Obama built a sweeping program of greenhouse gas regulations, aimed first at emissions from road vehicles, and later at fossil fuel power plants. It was the most ambitious federal climate policy in American history. Now, twelve years after Massachusetts was decided, that program is in ruins, largely repealed or weakened by the climate-skeptic Trump administration. Massachusetts has not provided a foundation for durable climate policy. The roots of Clean Air Act climate policy’s failures lie not just in changes in political leadership, but with a majority on the Supreme Court increasingly skeptical of not just climate regulation specifically, but of the administrative state in general. This and other barriers will persist regardless of who is in the White House.

I use computational text analysis to detect the emphasis on inquiry-based learning in the websites of all charter schools operating in the 2015-16 school year. I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, valid, population-wide data, as well as by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing.

We present the first evidence that this association is causal. We employ a natural experiment that rests on a peculiar time-shifting feature of Ramadan that makes the length of fasting time vary from year-to-year and by latitude. We find that an hour increase in fasting during the median Ramadan day increases the vote shares of Islamist political parties by about 6.5 percentage-points in Turkey’s parliamentary elections between 1973 and 2018. This effect is weaker in provinces where the proportion of non-orthodox Muslims is higher, but stronger in provinces where the number of per capita mosques and of religious personnel is higher. Further analyses suggest that the main mechanism underlying our findings is an increased commitment to religion induced by costlier practice.

The cantata is composed to commemorate 30th anniversary of Long March. The journey of the Long March covered 11 provinces over 4,000 miles and crossed 24 rivers and 18 mountain ranges for over 370 days. The libretto is a set of narrative poetry by General Hua Xiao in Sept, 1964. ""Long March Cantata"" is conceptually composed based on ""Where to go and where to say, when you hear the melody, the audiences will realize that it’s Guizhou, Yunnan, North Shaanxi ... Wherever the music is performed, it should restore the imaging of local feeling"". This article mainly discusses its absorption of Chinese folk music based on Chinese pentatonic scales in music composition. Among them, movement one ""Farewell (Leave the Base Area)"" uses Jiangxi folk tunes, and the movement three ""The Zunyi Conference, the Brilliance"" use Guizhou tunes according to composers. For examples, in the movement four "" Raid of Four times Cross Red Water "", Yunnan tunes are used, and in the movement seven ""Arrive Wuqi Town"", the northern Shaanxi tunes are used. In movement eight “Cheers"" and movement nine ""Annunciation"", the tune of Changsha in Hunan and Northeast Jiangxi were selected to salute the southeast soldiers respectively. With the instrumental accompaniment of the full western orchestra, bel canto and national folk style signing (non-classical voicing) are well balanced. In order to match folk tune and regional congruency, Chinese traditional musical instruments, erhu (二胡), pipa (三弦), zhudi (bamboo flute, 笛子), suona (Chinese trumpet唢呐), kuaiban (bamboo castanets, 快板) as well as other Chinese percussion etc. were used with the western symphony orchestra according to historical context.",TRUE,FALSE,Chinese choral repertoire|folk song|Long March Cantata|melody|music conception,2020-03-10T21:23:41.690837,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-10T21:23:26.043538,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d44|Arts and Humanities|Music|Musicology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/citation/,cv86e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6ncax/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/relationships/node/,6ncax,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e669f690f987d03a4496326/,5e669f690f987d03a4496326,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cv86e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cv86e/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cv86e

Evidence from a factorial survey,"This paper investigates the impact of fathers’ flexible working hours on their willingness to contribute to domestic work. We first hypothesize that fathers will contribute more if they have the possibility to work flexible hours. Second, fathers are assumed to contribute less if their female partners have the possibility to work flexible hours. We test our hypotheses using data from a vignette study, where fathers evaluate hypothetical job offers to their non-employed partner with regard to the contribution to domestic work they are willing to offer if their partner accepts the job. We find that fathers’ flexible hours increase their willingness to contribute to childcare but not to household work, partially supporting hypothesis one. Regarding hypothesis two, we find no effects of the female partner’s flexible working hours on fathers’ contribution to childcare or household work. We conclude our paper with some policy implications.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-03-10T21:24:02.159487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-10T21:23:46.715034,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/citation/,euwf7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e669ce50f987d03b5494dfb/,5e669ce50f987d03b5494dfb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/euwf7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/euwf7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/euwf7

The former entered the labor market largely after the large rise in inequality that occurred around 1980 while the latter entered the labor market well before this inflection point. We show that the rank-rank slope rose from 0.24 to 0.36 and the IGE increased from 0.21 to 0.50. We find that both the increase in the returns to schooling and the gradient in the likelihood of marriage by parent income can explain some of the increase in persistence. We also find direct evidence of a decline in absolute intergenerational mobility using intergenerational data, consistent with the bounds-based approach of Chetty et al. (2017).
