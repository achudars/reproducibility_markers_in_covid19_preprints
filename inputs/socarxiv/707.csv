literature. Unfortunately, most of that attention has been devoted to the
problem of whether software is or should be patentable subject matter. With
roughly 40,000 software patents already issued, and the Federal Circuit
endorsing patentability without qualification, those questions are for the
history books. The more pressing questions now concern the scope to be
accorded software patents. In this paper, we examine the implications of
some traditional patent law doctrines for innovation in the software
industry. We argue that patent law needs some refinement if it is to
promote rather than impede the growth of this new market, which is
characterized by rapid sequential innovation, reuse and re-combination of
components, and strong network effects that privilege interoperable
components and products. In particular, we argue for two sorts of new rules
in software patent cases.

First, we advocate a limited right to reverse engineer patented computer
programs in order to gain access to and study those programs and to
duplicate their unprotected elements. Such a right is firmly established in
copyright law, and seems unexceptional as a policy matter even in patent
law. But because patent law contains no fair use or reverse engineering
exemption, patentees could use the grant of rights on a single component of
a complex program to prevent any ""making"" or ""using"" of the program as a
whole, including those temporary uses needed in reverse engineering. While
patent law does contain doctrines of ""experimental use"" and ""exhaustion,""
it is not at all clear that those doctrines will protect legitimate reverse
engineering efforts. We suggest that if these doctrines cannot be read
broadly enough to establish such a right, Congress should create a limited
right to reverse engineer software containing patented components for
research purposes.

Second, we argue that in light of the special nature of innovation within
the software industry, courts should apply the doctrine of equivalents
narrowly in infringement cases. The doctrine of equivalents allows a
finding of infringement even when the accused product does not literally
satisfy each element of the patent, if there is substantial equivalence as
to each element. The test of equivalence is the known interchangeability of
claimed and accused elements at the time of (alleged) infringement. A
number of factors unique to software and the software industry - a culture
of reuse and incremental improvement, a lack of reliance on systems of
formal documentation used in other technical fields, the short effective
life of software innovations, and the inherent plasticity of code -
severely complicate post hoc assessments of the ""known interchangeability""
of software elements. A standard for equivalence of code elements that
ignores these factors risks stifling legitimate, successful efforts to
design around existing software patents. To avoid this danger, courts
should construe software claims narrowly, and should refuse a finding of
equivalence if the accused element is ""interchangeable"" with prior art that
should have narrowed the original patent, or if the accused improvement is
too many generations removed from the original invention.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:05.835687,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T21:49:14.772000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/citation/,rmtx4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/msqey/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/relationships/node/,msqey,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc4dc6c613b01e9d931bb/,57bcc4dc6c613b01e9d931bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rmtx4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rmtx4

trial. These settlements involve agreements between the patentee and the
accused infringer, parties who are often competitors before the lawsuit.
Because these competitors may agree to stop competing, to regulate the
price each charges, and to exchange information about products and prices,
settlements of intellectual property disputes naturally raise antitrust
concerns. In this paper, we suggest a way to reconcile the interests of
intellectual property law and antitrust law in evaluating intellectual
property settlements. In Part I, we provide background on the issue. Part
II argues that in most cases courts can determine the legality of a
settlement agreement without inquiring into the merits of the intellectual
property dispute being settled, either because the settlement would be
legal even if the patent were invalid or not infringed, or because the
settlement would be illegal even if the patent were valid and infringed.
Only in a narrow class of cases will the merits of the intellectual
property dispute matter. In Part III, we argue that in that narrow middle
set of cases antitrust's rule of reason is unlikely to be helpful. Rather,
courts must inquire into the validity, enforceability, and infringement
issues in the underlying case, with particular sensitivity to both the type
of intellectual property right at issue and the industrial context of the
dispute. In Part IV, we apply our framework to a number of common
settlement terms, most notably the use of exclusion payments to settle
pharmaceutical patent disputes. We argue that exclusion payments that
exceed litigation costs should be deemed illegal per se. There is no
legitimate reason for such payments, and the most likely reason - to permit
the patentee to exclude competition that would likely have occurred absent
the payment - is anticompetitive. Further, legitimate patent disputes can
be settled in other ways than with an exclusion payment - for example, by
licensing the defendant or by agreeing to delay entry.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:32.741425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T21:45:35.249000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/citation/,dnv59,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cwxak/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/relationships/node/,cwxak,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc400b83f6901f8655eed/,57bcc400b83f6901f8655eed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dnv59/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dnv59

of patent prosecution, litigation, licensing and other uses of patents, he
demonstrates that strengthening the examination process is not cost

noncontroversial purposes like financing. Because of this, society would be
better off spending its resources in a more searching judicial inquiry into

environment, the real stakes lie in suing those who facilitate infringement
by others. There is of course a good reason copyright owners are filing
such suits. They see themselves as under threat from a flood of cheap, easy
copies and a dramatic increase in the number of people who can make those
copies. The high volume of illegal uses, and the low return to suing any
individual, make it more cost-effective to aim as far up the chain as
possible. From the perspective of the movie industry, it's easier and more
effective to shut down Napster than to sue the millions of people who
traded files illegally on Napster. So far, the courts have been willing to
go along, shutting down a number of innovative services in the digital
music realm.

In this article, we argue that unrestricted liability for anyone who is in
any way involved with copyright infringement is a bad idea. Indirect
liability is a continuum, in which acts most closely related to
infringement and with the fewest affirmative benefits are the easiest to
condemn. Going after makers of technology for the uses to which their
technologies may be put threatens to stifle innovation. The fundamental
difficulty is that while courts can make decisions about direct
infringement on a case-by-case basis, lawsuits based on indirect liability
necessarily sweep together both socially beneficial and socially harmful
uses of a program or service, either permitting both uses or condemning
both.

Optimal digital copyright policy would do two things: stop deterring
innovators, and permit cost-effective enforcement of copyright in the
digital environment. In this paper, we suggest at least two possible
alternatives that might provide ways out of the digital copyright morass.
Both alternatives stem from the basic economics of copyright enforcement.
It is not currently cost-effective for copyright owners to sue individual
infringers, because there are tens of millions of them, because lawsuits
are expensive, and because each infringer would be liable only for minimal
damages. They are happy to sue facilitators instead, because there are
fewer of them and both damages and the benefits of injunctive relief are
substantial. Copyright owners have no incentive to permit optimal
innovation by facilitators, because they do not benefit from that
innovation except indirectly. Individual infringers in turn have no
incentive to change their behavior or to subscribe to fee-based services,
because they suffer none of the costs of infringement.

One solution is to change the incentives of individuals. Because individual
users of peer-to-peer (p2p) networks know that it is extremely unlikely
they will be sued, economic theory suggests that the only way to
effectively deter infringement is to increase the effective sanction
substantially for those who are caught. Were the government to begin
criminally prosecuting selected users of peer-to-peer services - or were
the RIAA to sue end users in earnest - it could have a substantial
deterrent effect on many illegal users. Selective prosecution has other
advantages as well - the government could target the relatively few
keystone providers of illegal files on p2p sites, and those are precisely
the users who are least likely to be engaged in fair use. While particular
prosecutions won't stop illegal file trading altogether, copyright owners
have never been able to prevent all piracy. All they need to do is reduce
piracy enough that they can make a return on their investment.

Another solution is to change the incentives of copyright owners to sue
individual infringers by reducing the cost of such a suit. One such
approach would be a levy system. Levies on equipment or services have the
virtue of permitting automatic collection of royalties, reducing the
enforcement cost dramatically, but at the cost of taxing legal as well as
illegal uses. A levy solves the enforcement problem at the front end, but
it is similar in many ways to the current approach of suing facilitators.
The main difference is that under a levy system the copyright owner is
protected by a compulsory license rather than a property rule.

An alternative proposal to reduce the cost of enforcement is to create some
sort of quick, cheap arbitration system that enables copyright owners to
get some limited relief against abusers of p2p systems. The existing domain
name trademark arbitration system is a model in some respects - its speed
and low cost - but a cautionary tale in others - its lack of process
protections. Such a system would permit low-cost enforcement of copyright
infringement against direct infringers, reducing the need for content
owners to sue facilitators. Relative to levies, an arbitration system would
trade off some increase in cost for accuracy, targeting only those making
illegal uses rather than all users of computers or p2p networks. It would
be fairer than selective criminal prosecution, because the burden would
fall more evenly on each wrongdoer, rather than imposing stark punishment
on a few in order to serve society's interest in deterring the rest. The
system could also be designed to improve accuracy relative to the binary
choice the courts face in indirect infringement cases today. We could
design the system so that it is limited to clear cases. We could also build
in a defense for arguable fair uses, so that a user who could prove they
were space-shifting CDs they already own would have a defense.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:43.982441,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T18:40:41.074000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/citation/,n4863,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r3msp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/relationships/node/,r3msp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc98aa594d900201d0d9cf/,57bc98aa594d900201d0d9cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n4863/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n4863

variety of technologies. With only a few exceptions, the statute does not
distinguish between different technologies in setting and applying legal
standards. In theory, then, we have a uniform patent system that provides
technology-neutral protection to all kinds of innovation. Technology,
however, is anything but uniform, and displays highly diverse
characteristics across different sectors. A wealth of empirical evidence
demonstrates deep structural differences in how industries innovate.
Industries vary in the speed and cost of Research and Development (""R&D""),
in the ease with which inventions can be imitated by others, in the need
for cumulative or interoperative innovation rather than stand-alone
development, and in the extent to which patents cover entire products or
merely components of products. We show that there is no reason to assume
that a unitary patent system will optimally encourage innovation in the
wide range of diverse industries that it is expected to cover.

Despite the appearance of uniformity, however, patent law is actually as
varied as the industries it seeks to foster. Closer examination of patent
law demonstrates that it is unified only in concept. In practice the rules
actually applied to different industries have shown increasing divergence.
As a practical matter, it appears that although patent law is
technology-neutral in theory, it is technology-specific in application. The
differential application of patent standards to different industries
correlates with a larger theoretical confusion in patent law. While most
theorists agree on the general utilitarian framework of patent law - that
is, they agree on the goals the patent statute is intended to achieve -
they have offered radically different ideas regarding how patent law should
be interpreted to achieve those goals. We examine the various different
theoretical approaches to patent law. We suggest that none of these
theories is entirely correct. Neither are they entirely wrong. We show how
various different theories of patent law succeed in explaining the
application of patent law to particular industries, but fail when taken
outside the narrow context of those industries.

The fact that economic evidence, patent doctrine, and legal theory all vary
by industry leads us to question whether patent law should explicitly
attempt to tailor protection to the needs of specific industries. We point
out a number of risks inherent in such a technology-specific approach,
particularly one administered by Congress. In particular, concerns about
rent seeking and the inability of industry-specific statutes to respond to
changing circumstances lead us to conclude that we should not jettison our
nominally uniform patent system in favor of specific statutes that protect
particular industries. Nonetheless, there are other ways the law can take
account of the needs of different industries. We argue that it makes sense
to take economic policy and industry-specific variation explicitly into
account in applying general patent rules to specific cases. Patent law
gives the courts substantial freedom to do this by means of flexible legal
standards we call ""policy levers."" We identify ten sets of policy levers
that already exist in patent law, and the ways in which they implicitly or
explicitly permit the courts to take account of different types of
innovation in different industries. We also identify a variety of other
places where the statute grants the courts substantial discretion, and
suggest ways that those discretionary standards could serve as policy
levers. Finally, having identified certain policy levers and the method of
their employment, we consider the economic characteristics of innovation in
five different industries that appear to be likely candidates for
industry-specific rules: chemistry, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology,

(IP) and antitrust law. I describe the ways in which these two important
areas of government regulation are and are not in tension, and discuss the
history of the relationship between these laws. I argue that IP and
antitrust have cycled between over- and under-protection, and that we are
currently (and mistakenly) conditioned to think of private property and
private ordering as efficient in and of themselves, rather than as
efficient only in the context of robust market competition. Further, I
argue that antitrust can serve the goals of innovation and dynamic
efficiency directly in circumstances in which competition, not monopoly,
serves as a spur to innovation. The goal of the IP and antitrust laws
should be to seek a robust balance between competition and monopoly in the
service of dynamic efficiency. When IP laws are strong, antitrust laws
should also be strong, and vice versa.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:48.854438,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T18:34:12.999000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/citation/,pw7m8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s563w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/relationships/node/,s563w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc9726b83f6901f2655df7/,57bc9726b83f6901f2655df7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pw7m8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pw7m8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pw7m8

circumstance of unified infringement by a single actor. But modern commerce
is not limited by national boundaries or by corporate forms. Patents
written to cover modern technologies, particularly network computing
technologies, are attempting to bring the distributed acts of different
users around the globe into the ambit of a territorial legal system that
looks for a single infringer. Not surprisingly, the effort to do so has
created significant problems for patent cases.

Two of those problems are the subject of our article. They involve what we
call divided or distributed patent claims - claims that are infringed only
by aggregating the conduct of more than one actor, or aggregating conduct
that occurs in more than one country. Patent law doesn't deal well with
either class of divided patent claim. Prosecutors and litigators need to be
aware of these problems in order to most effectively represent their
clients.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:32.221954,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T18:31:25.511000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/citation/,7pfsx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/atd5w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/relationships/node/,atd5w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc967f6c613b01ecd931c5/,57bc967f6c613b01ecd931c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pfsx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7pfsx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7pfsx
