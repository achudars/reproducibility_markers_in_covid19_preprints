Openaire) and it is trying to implement it in the Horizon 2020 program, 
the gap between the tools and the human beings – researchers, citizen 
scientists, students, ordinary people – is still wide. The necessity to 
dictate open access publishing as a mandate for the EU funded research – 
ten years after the BOAI - is an obvious symptom of it: there is a chasm 
between the net and the public use of reason. To escalate the 
advancement and the reuse of research, we should federate the multitude 
of already existing open access journals in federal open overlay 
journals that receive their contents from the member journals and boost 
it with their aggregation power and their semantic web tools. The 
article contains both the theoretical basis and the guidelines for a 
project whose goals are: 1. making open access journals visible, highly 
cited and powerful, by federating them into wide disciplinary overlay 
journals; 2. avoiding the traps of the “authors pay” open access 
business model, by exploiting one of the virtue of federalism: the 
federate journals can remain little and affordable, if they gain 
visibility from the power of the federal overlay journal aggregating 
them; 3. enriching the overlay journals both through semantic annotation 
tools and by means of open platforms dedicated to host ex post peer 
review and experts comments; 4. making the selection and evaluation 
processes and their resulting data as much as possible public and open, 
to avoid the pitfalls (e. g, the serials price crisis) experienced by 
the closed access publishing model. It is about time to free academic 
publishing from its expensive walled gardens and to put to test the 
tools that can help us to transform it in one open forest, with one 
hundred flowers – and one hundred trailblazers.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:01.726317,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T20:45:54.140000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/citation/,xtycn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yt97j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/relationships/node/,yt97j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578bee8e594d9001f4859f40/,578bee8e594d9001f4859f40,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtycn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xtycn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xtycn,NA

One prominent recent study, Newman, Johnston, and Lown (2015), argues that, consistent with the conflict theory, exposure to higher levels of local income inequality lead lower-income people to become more likely to reject—and higher-income people to become more likely to accept—the dominant U.S. ideology of meritocracy.  Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study's own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis.  We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion.  Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.

The answer of Kant is contained in the fifth preliminary article of the Perpetual Peace and it leans towards non-interventionism: a bad constitution can never justify a war, because it may be the root only of a scandalum acceptum. To understand the meaning of scandalum acceptum we have to become aware that it is a term originating from moral theology, which we should translate into the language of international law. Most of Kant's contemporaries still understood the scandal as the sin of advertising a sinful behavior. A scandalum is only acceptum, however, if the act that inspired others to sin has been done without the intention to give them a bad example. A flawed constitution can only be the occasion of a scandalum acceptum because its legal power does not spread its influence beyond the border of its state. If a nation chooses to imitate the allegedly wrong constitution of another state, its choice only depends on its sovereignty, because it is a matter of internal constitutional law.

alluvial plains of rivers leading to positive landforms that may change
hydrogeomorphology dynamics or to be exposed to the floods. The other side,
their location in hilly or mountainous regions increase vulnerability to
other geomorphological process (gully erosion, landslide). Also, the
extension of human settlements and land use is influenced by the presence
of such a site either it is closed. The implications of these landforms are
varied and must be
linked to geographical realities from around. Thus, the mapping of these
anthropogenic landforms contribute to a better understanding of the

in waste management schemes from rural areas. Lack of sanitation services
or rudimentary waste management systems favored this practice. This paper
proposes a method to estimate the amounts of household waste uncontrolled
disposed at local administrative unit level (commune) for 2003 and 2010.
Based
on estimating the amounts of waste generated and uncollected are introduced
new indicators in the quantitative analysis taking into account the
household waste composition, individual composting of biodegradable waste
or recyclable waste from households for a more proper assessment of waste
disposed. Usually household waste is disposed in various sites according to
local geographical context such as open dumps on local roadsides, forest
areas or on riverbanks. The indicators were calculated for each commune
from the county that did not have access to sanitation services. Processed
data were mapped, thematic maps outlining regional disparities existing
between communes from county. Comparative analysis of the years 2003
(pre-accession period) and 2010 (post-accession) highlights the changes and
difficulties to provide waste management facilities in rural territory.",TRUE,FALSE,environment|environmental policy|pollution|Preprint|public utilities|rural development|rural geography|rural studies|socarxiv|spatial analysis,2018-07-02T10:52:04.319572,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T17:51:02.720000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/citation/,r5th8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b2xff/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/relationships/node/,b2xff,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578bc5886c613b01f5347d47/,578bc5886c613b01f5347d47,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5th8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r5th8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r5th8,NA
