To achieve this end, an in-depth analysis of phrases and sentences will be carried out to see whetherArberry has succeeded in rendering all kinds of emotive meanings expressed in the Al-Muallaqat.   Samples subjected to the analysis will be taken from the Odes of five bards, namely: Imru' al-Qais, Tarafa, Zuhair, Antara, and Labid.  The reason behind focusing on these odes is that they have cultural overtones that are difficult to capture in translation.  These sentences and phrases will be discussed and analyzed in details, and their emotive meanings at all levels will be compared to those in the ST.  After the analysis is conducted, conclusions will be drawn as to why Arberry has not accounted for the loss of emotive meaning that has led to the distortion of the source text (ST).

Variation in the representation or display of language, however, remains a relatively understudied phenomenon. With this in mind, we present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the variation observed in the Linguistic Landscape (LL) of Pilsen, Chicago. A community undergoing perceived processes of gentrification, Pilsen is an active site of economic, sociocultural change as well as newly intensified language contact. To investigate Pilsen’s displayed language variation, we implement a series of logistic regression models that analyze the distribution of both language and contextual framing observed on signs in four key areas in Pilsen. In doing so, we present an informed means with which to understand the sociolinguistic context of Pilsen as a community undergoing change and provide a replicable framework for future study of LLs that experience similar dynamics.

We engage the theoretical concept of cultural chronotopes (Agha, 2007a) to demonstrate how spatially and temporally entwined experiences of nostalgia and modernity are produced in South Delhi’s commercial LL, and show how such positioning serves to compress or flatten such experiences for ready consumption (Kockelman, 2006). Focusing on particularized chronotopes tied to a privileged and elite experience, imagination and aspiration, we highlight how discourses of the ‘ideal’ are reproduced and positioned as visceral through specific references or semiotic arrangements. In so doing, we discuss the quantification of experience executed by these signs in commodifying the visceral, and the problematic way these instances propagate an idealized, sanitized and simplified understanding of Indian rural communities, Indian history and Indian traditional practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Chronotopes|Commodification|Hindi|India|Linguistic Landscapes|Nostalgia|Sociolinguistics,2018-07-02T10:47:36.443598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-16T18:55:16.446000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d17|Arts and Humanities|South and Southeast Asian Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d27|Arts and Humanities|Modern Languages|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/citation/,ajmg6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ssv5r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/relationships/node/,ssv5r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cade9e594d9001fa8ab9bf/,58cade9e594d9001fa8ab9bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ajmg6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ajmg6

This expansion in scope has, for the most part, moved away from quantitative methods in favor of more in-depth ethnographic approaches, situating the optimal analysis of the LL within careful consideration of the context(s) in which a sign may occur and/or bring about as well as the fluidity of interpretation researchers must allow in their assessments of signs’ significance (Banda and Jimaima 2015; Jaworski and Thurlow 2010; Malinowski 2010; Kallen 2010). In the face of such shifts towards contextualization over context or process over product, quantitative-based approaches which tend to rely on the establishment of discrete categories may be seen as problematic (Gorter and Cenoz 2015; Gorter 2006).

We draw on an earlier affordability exercise to evaluate how Americans might view these elements of health care reform.
Methods: Immediately prior to passage of the ACA, we conducted a telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. households. Respondents were presented vignettes representing different insurance plans, each held by people with differing life characteristics. Respondents were then asked to assess the affordability of the presented plans given the characteristics of the policyholders. 
Results: Respondents felt that households should be expected to pay about 5% of income for health insurance coverage, irrespective of their income. They also tended to view older households as less able to afford coverage than younger households, and households with sicker occupants as less able to afford healthcare than households with healthy occupants.

Conclusions: Most Americans, including those who reside in red states, believe that subsidies for health insurance premiums should be based on a fixed percentage of household income, not a fixed dollar amount.

More specifically, we focus on living labs (LL) and vacancy in general, as well as on their potential role in fostering creative economy-fuelled gentrification. LL utilise Lo-Fi technologies to foster local digital innovation and support community-focused civic hacking, running various kinds of workshops and engaging with local citizens to co-create digital interventions and apps aimed at ‘solving’ local issues. Five approaches to LL are outlined and discussed in relation to vacancy and gentrification: pop-up initiatives, university-led activities, community organised venues/activities, citizen sensing and crowdsourcing, and tech-led regeneration initiatives. Notwithstanding the potential for generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring and fostering digital competences and increasing citizens’ participation in the SC, we argue that LL largely foster a form of participation framed within a model of civic stewardship for ‘smart citizens’. While presented as horizontal, open, and participative, LL and civic hacking are often rooted in pragmatic and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of a creative economy and a specific version of SC. As such, by encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space, LL potentially contributes to gentrification pressures within locales by attracting the creative classes and new investment. We discuss these approaches and issues generally and with respect to examples in Dublin, Ireland.",TRUE,FALSE,civic hacking|creative class|gentrification|living labs|property|regeneration|vacancy,2018-07-02T10:53:47.168053,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-16T10:17:03.665000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/citation/,waq2e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/37rg2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/relationships/node/,37rg2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58ca65556c613b01feed7f3b/,58ca65556c613b01feed7f3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/waq2e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/waq2e/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/waq2e

This exploratory mixed-methods study examines how people discuss and disclose the use of two different drugs—marijuana and heroin—in the popular online forum Reddit. In this study hermeneutic content analysis is employed in order to describe the type of comments people make in forums dedicated to discussions about illicit drugs. With inductive analysis, seven categories of comments were identified: disclosure, instruction and advice, culture, community norms, moralizing, legality, and banter. Our subsequent quantitative analysis indicates that although the amounts of disclosure are similar in each subreddit, there are more instances of instruction and advice in discussions about opiates, and more examples of banter in comments about marijuana use. In fact, both subreddits have high rates of banter. We argue that banter fosters disclosure in both subreddits, and that banter and disclosure are linked with information seeking behaviors in online forums. This work has implications for future explorations of disclosure online and for public health interventions aimed at disseminating credible information about drug use to at-risk individuals.",TRUE,FALSE,Disclosure|Drug use|Information Behavior|Information grounds|Information seeking|Online forums|Reddit|Risk|Social informatic,2018-07-02T10:48:25.149601,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-15T22:38:24.451000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/citation/,bk2ck,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kakvf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/relationships/node/,kakvf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/590e07de9ad5a1025b66bb85/,590e07de9ad5a1025b66bb85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk2ck/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bk2ck/,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23880,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bk2ck

One factor inhibiting data sharing is a concern about human participant protections and privacy. Protecting the confidentiality and safety of research participants is a concern for both quantitative and qualitative researchers, but it raises specific concerns within the epistemic context of qualitative research. Thus, the applicability of emerging protection models from the quantitative realm must be carefully evaluated for application to the qualitative realm. At the same time, qualitative scholars already employ a variety of strategies for human-participant protection implicitly or informally during the research process.

In this practice paper, we assess available strategies for protecting human participants and how they can be deployed. We describe a spectrum of possible data management options, such as anonymization and applying access controls, including some already employed by the Qualitative Data Repository (QDR) in tandem with its pilot depositors. Throughout the discussion, we consider the tension between modifying data or restricting access to them, and retaining their analytic value. We argue that developing explicit guidelines for sharing qualitative data generated through interaction with humans will allow scholars to address privacy concerns and increase the secondary use of their data.",TRUE,FALSE,data sharing|human participants|privacy|QDR Working Paper|qualitative data,2018-07-02T10:47:33.703037,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-15T20:31:03.826000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Archival Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/citation/,9n7w8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2sxtz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/relationships/node/,2sxtz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58c9a36a9ad5a1020202512e/,58c9a36a9ad5a1020202512e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n7w8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9n7w8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9n7w8
