This paper approaches this scandal from a viewpoint of how the indicators of the quality of the survey were falsified and misreported. Based on published information regarding sample size and sampling errors, the author outlines three problems. (1) Since at least the 1990s, the survey’s sample size has been reported as larger than it actually was. (2) Since 2002, a significant portion of the sample has been secretly discarded. (3) Since 2004, the sampling error has been underreported by ignoring errors occurring in the strata of large establishments. These problems have escaped public attention as the government and academics are not critical of the falsification of basic information that determines the quality of the survey.",TRUE,FALSE,economic indicator|falsification|Japan|labor statistics|misconduct|sample size|sampling error|wage survey,2019-03-05T12:23:08.652227,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-05T12:22:49.205904,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/citation/,2bf3z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9kp8c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/relationships/node/,9kp8c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7e3185ff4a89001927377e/,5c7e3185ff4a89001927377e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bf3z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2bf3z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2bf3z,NA

Research documents the struggles of individuals trying to find their way back into society. Less attention has been given to the organizational aspects of reentry. This is unfortunate given the rapid growth of nonprofit reentry organizations in the U.S., which introduces a new set of questions about the context and challenges to prisoner reentry. Drawing on an ethnography of Safe, a nonprofit reentry organization in the Northeast, I describe the organization's pivotal role in institutionalizing the pathway to prisoner reentry: a road to reentry, which takes former prisoners through a process that reconfigures their morality, identity, and social relationships. The road to reentry concept helps bring together scholars of the welfare state and criminology by highlighting how the challenges of prisoner reentry rely on how this process is organized. The way in which prison reentry is organized, in turn, affects former prisoners' agency and shapes the relationship between these men and women and their respective families and communities.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|criminology|ethnography|organizations|prisoner re-entry|structure|welfare state,2019-03-05T12:22:47.650582,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-05T12:22:07.830178,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/citation/,5kr3x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xcsqa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/relationships/node/,xcsqa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7d0d2cff4a89001925e248/,5c7d0d2cff4a89001925e248,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kr3x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kr3x,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12254

Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1823), generally considered the beginning of SF as a genre (Freedman, 2000), tells the tale of a scientist who harnesses technology and electricity to reanimate an entity stitched together from the remains of the recent dead. However, it is telling that Victor Frankenstein is now generally considered a metaphor for the arrogance of scientists who fail to consider the harmful potential of their work. While rarely as dramatic as stories of resurrection, Tony Walter (Walter, 2015) has convincingly argued that for thousands of years every communication technology, from etching in stone and cave paintings onward, has been used to communicate with the dead in some fashion. It comes as no surprise, then, that technology start-ups and entrepreneurs are attempting to harness digital technologies, social media, and networked communication not just to speak to the dead but also to use their digital residues to seemingly offer both resurrection and immortality.
This chapter examines the promotional discourse deployed by three of these futuristic start-up companies – LivesOn (LivesOn, 2013), Eterni.me (“Eterni.me - Virtual Immortality,” 2016) and Humai (Humai, 2016) – and compares these with several notable SF texts which explore the underlying presumptions and broader cultural and social ramifications of these companies succeeding in achieving digital resurrection. The episode ‘Be Right Back’ of the dystopian television series Black Mirror (Harris, 2013) imagines a world where someone could be reconstituted from the detailed record of their lives left behind across various social media accounts, but with clear echoes of Frankenstein. The series returns to these themes in a more endearing fashion in the upbeat ‘San Junipero’ (Harris, 2016) which features a digital afterlife fashioned after the nineteen eighties.  Australian hard SF author and computer scientist Greg Egan also explores this terrain in great detail; his short story ‘Learning to be Me’ (Egan, 1995) and novel Permutation City (Egan, 1994) reveal many of the philosophical presumptions and potential outcomes of a digitised afterlife (Leaver, 2004). In comparing these technology companies and SF texts, this chapter operates on two levels: the first, being to ask what presumptions are being made about contemporary personhood, culture and death; and secondly, mapping what future issues might the success of these start-ups actually provoke.",TRUE,FALSE,data|digital death|frankenstein|greg egan|science fiction|startups,2019-03-05T12:22:01.530445,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-05T12:21:31.189808,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/citation/,2gkw9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/atczd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/relationships/node/,atczd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7cd402773b2d001706244e/,5c7cd402773b2d001706244e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2gkw9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2gkw9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2gkw9,NA

The Gahagan bifaces (n = 102) were scanned, then analysed using a novel landmarking protocol and the tools of geometric morphometrics. Results provide a preview of the significant differences in Gahagan biface morphology expressed between the southern Caddo area and central Texas regions. The size discrepancy represents an inversion of current theoretical constructs that posit a decrease in tool size thought to articulate with an increase in distance from the raw material source. It is posited that the contrasting morphologies represent two discrete communities of practise; one (emergent Caddo horticulturalists) where Gahagan bifaces were enlisted primarily for burial and ritualistic activities, and the other  (central Texas hunter-gatherers) where Gahagan bifaces were utilised over a longer time span in more practical and utilitarian contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,3D geometric morphometrics|archaeological science|computational archaeology|digital humanities|museum studies|NAGPRA|repository studies|STEM|virtual archaeology,2019-03-03T15:14:24.507578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-03T15:14:07.291988,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/citation/,fyw2d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2g95w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/relationships/node/,2g95w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7b9d58773b2d001803326d/,5c7b9d58773b2d001803326d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyw2d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fyw2d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fyw2d,https://doi.org/10.1080/0734578X.2020.1744416

An Alternative Theory of Racial Cognition,"Directing attention to racial ignorance as a core dimension of racialized social systems, this article advances a process-focused Theory of Racial Ignorance (TRI), grounded in Critical Race Theory and the philosophical construct white ignorance. TRI embodies five tenets—epistemology of ignorance, ignorance as ends-based technology, corporate white agency, centrality of praxis, and interest convergence. TRI’s tenets explain how racial ignorance reinforces white domination, attending to mechanisms of white knowledge evasion and resistance that facilitate racial reproduction—in everyday life, through institutions, and across societies more broadly. I illustrate TRI’s assets by comparison to an extant theory of racial cognition—color-blind theory (CBT).

We argue that the enactment of dialogue on digital platforms requires certain combinations of media affordances, and that affordance theory provides a more systematic, holistic, and theoretical framework to investigate digital public relations practice. Additionally, we question the relevance of the fifth dialogic principle --- ``ease of interface'' --- in the Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 era, and propose ``favorable affordances'' as a conceptual update to re-imagine dialogic principles on social media, answering the call of Sommerfeldt &amp; Yang (2018). We recommend using affordance theory to rephrase heated discussions on the tension between digital media and dialogic communication, to improve the relevance of dialogic theory for the digital age, and to re-examine relevant concepts in digital public relations.",TRUE,FALSE,Affordance|Dialogic Communication|Dialogic Principles|Dialogue|Digital Media,2019-03-03T05:18:42.202948,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-03T05:18:22.739044,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e10|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Public Relations and Advertising|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/citation/,uzhk9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7a6e36ff4a89001b22d74b/,5c7a6e36ff4a89001b22d74b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uzhk9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uzhk9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uzhk9,NA

This effect, as we predict, does not occur for praying regularly which is a more costly and harder to observe practice. We argue that veiling is higher in AKP provinces not only because of a generic aim to conform to the stricter mores fostered by the victorious party. We find that those who veil, particularly those in AKP provinces who are not pious, are more politically active than those who do not veil. This may be an indication that veiling could partly be a strategic response to policies, which favour those who are or appear pious. Our study suggests that observable religious practices may have their independent dynamics driven by the pursuit of instrumental goals. Our results also suggest that parties with a religious ideology have an advantage over their secular counterparts in solving the clientelistic information problem, for they can rely on religious symbols for screening and signalling.",TRUE,FALSE,clientelism|Islamic veiling|natural experiment|reputation|signal,2019-03-03T04:50:42.433754,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-03T04:50:26.980410,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/citation/,ezpaq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7a5b6358e63b0017d42ab6/,5c7a5b6358e63b0017d42ab6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezpaq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ezpaq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ezpaq,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaa035

This paper reports results from a research project that collected raw street network data from OpenStreetMap using the Python-based OSMnx software for every U.S. city and town, county, urbanized area, census tract, and Zillow-defined neighborhood. It constructed nonplanar directed multigraphs for each and analyzed their structural and morphological characteristics. The resulting data repository contains over 110,000 processed, cleaned street network graphs (which in turn comprise over 55 million nodes and over 137 million edges) at various scales—comprehensively covering the entire U.S.—archived as reusable open-source GraphML files, node/edge lists, and GIS shapefiles that can be immediately loaded and analyzed in standard tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS, NetworkX, graph-tool, igraph, or Gephi. The repository also contains measures of each network’s metric and topological characteristics common in urban design, transportation planning, civil engineering, and network science.
