One ideal that unites us is that we typically perceive of ourselves as contributing to the public good by helping to understand and preserve the past (Chippindale 1994). We act as stewards for archaeological sites and artefacts, and we work to correct misinformed views of the past that might have sinister motives. However, many of the current norms of archaeological practice are at odds with these ideals of archaeology. We share relatively little of our research with each other or the public. Typically we produce a journal article or monograph as a final product, but we rarely share the data files or computational methods that generated those final products, nor do we share our written work in ways that are readily accessible to the public. This suggests a gap between current practice and ideals. It also limits the reproducibility of our research, and the efficiency with which new methods can spread through the discipline. We show that an exploration of this mismatch between ideals and practice can reveal untapped potential for digital tools in archaeology to improve its sustainability as a research domain, and indicate new ways to engage with the public. We describe emerging norms in archaeology, and some new digital tools that archaeologists are using, that are helping to close the gap between ideals and current practices.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|ethics|openscience|stewardship,2019-08-22T15:33:01.636655,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22T15:32:34.120925,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RHVN5,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/citation/,s8z6u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sbmt2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/relationships/node/,sbmt2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5d9a27bc2a23001986d662/,5d5d9a27bc2a23001986d662,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s8z6u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s8z6u,NA

Relatively little is known about how demand-side market actors use online information and the implications for social stratification and mobility. This study provides an in-depth exploration of the online recruitment strategies pursued by human resource (HR) professionals. Qualitative interviews with 61 HR recruiters in two southern US metro areas reveal two distinct patterns in how they use Internet resources to fill jobs. For low and general skill work, they post advertisements to online job boards (e.g., Monster, CareerBuilder) with massive audiences of job seekers. By contrast, for high-skill or supervisory positions, they use LinkedIn to target passive candidates – employed individuals who are not looking for work but might be willing to change jobs. Although there are some intermediate practices, the overall picture is one of an increasingly bifurcated “winner-take-all” labor market in which recruiters focus their efforts on poaching specialized superstar talent (“purple squirrels”) from the ranks of the currently employed, while active job seekers are relegated to the hyper-competitive and impersonal “black hole” of the online job boards.",TRUE,FALSE,hiring|inequality|internet|job search|labor markets|recruitment|stratification,2019-08-22T15:38:23.100514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22T15:37:53.295355,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Emerald,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/citation/,36p2x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nmbze/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/relationships/node/,nmbze,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5c86189aa3820019fb46af/,5d5c86189aa3820019fb46af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/36p2x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/36p2x,https://doi.org/10.1108/S0277-283320190000033006

It articulates the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) of a given curriculum, together with the developmental trajectory that learning these KSAs is intended to follow. Mastery Rubrics have focused on graduate and post-graduate curricula, and utilize the European Guild Structure for staging growth and development of KSAs. Bloom’s taxonomy is also essential for describing the performance, and performance levels, in each stage. A defining characteristic of the Mastery Rubric is the Master level: the Master is qualified, with evidence, to take a learner from novice through to Master. However, the transition from competent independent performer of a set of KSAs to Master is not addressed in any of the Mastery Rubrics to date. This article describes three levels through which any instructor can progress in order to generate evidence they are qualified at the Master level for any Mastery Rubric, even those that have already been published to include a (single) Master level. These three levels describe the evidence that can be observed to represent early, middle, and late Master capabilities in terms of teaching, and assessing learning, in students and trainees. Two new Mastery Rubrics (MRs) have recently been completed, and neither has a Master level: one for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi) and one for the Nurse Practitioner (NR-NP). Although this new Mastery Rubric for the Master Level (MR-ML) can be used with all of the existing Mastery Rubrics to characterize the development of the Master’s engagement with theories and practicalities of learning, we use the MR-Bi and MR-NP to illustrate how the MR-ML can work with these two new MRs, and how individuals in any field can compile their evidence of the specific abilities to diagnose problems exhibited by those at earlier stages, devise remediating activities for those problems, and assess the result.",TRUE,FALSE,adult learning|cognitive psychology|faculty development|Mastery Rubric|preparing future faculty|teaching and learning,2019-08-23T13:35:45.133713,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-23T13:35:23.991580,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5e|Education|Higher Education|Scholarship of Teaching and Learning|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7c|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Adult and Continuing Education and Teaching|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7f|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Higher Education and Teaching,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/citation/,md65v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/relationships/node/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5c440d9aa3820018fa94d9/,5d5c440d9aa3820018fa94d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/md65v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/md65v,NA

While OLS estimates show that BMI is significantly associated with worse mental health in both young adulthood and old age, they are likely to be confounded by (i) unobserved factors that affect both BMI and mental health and (ii) reverse causality. To tackle confounding, we take two complementary approaches. First, we use a polygenic score for BMI as an IV and adjust for polygenic scores for other factors that may invalidate this IV. The IV estimates indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between BMI and mental health for young adults, whereas there is a positive and statistically significant relationship for the elderly. Moreover, we show that IV estimates likely have to be interpreted as identifying a weighted average of effects of BMI on mental health mostly for individuals on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. Given potential remaining concerns about the validity of the IV, our second approach is to consider it an “imperfect” IV and estimate an upper bound on the average treatment effect for the corresponding population following Nevo &amp; Rosen (2012). The estimated upper bounds reinforce the conclusions from the IV estimates: they show little evidence of a detrimental effect of BMI on mental health for young adults while being consistent with an economically meaningful effect for elderly individuals.

In our analysis, we make use of random variation in the field period of the European Social Survey (ESS) to fashion a natural experimental design. The survey’s field period took place in Germany from August 23, 2016, to March 26, 2017. Hence, the Christmas market attack took place approximately halfway through the ESS’s field phase, thus making it possible to study the causal effect on changing attitudes toward minorities before and after the attack. We argue that the terrorist attack creates a spillover effect and negatively shapes public opinion of uninvolved ethnic minorities. Our data analysis suggests that immediately after the event, only people with a right-wing political attitude appear to be affected by the proposed spillover effect. However, we find that the worsening of attitudes toward refugees can also be observed in the general population as time progresses.

The city became a focal point of intensive intellectual debate whose participants regarded Kyiv not only as a place of a recent battleground but also as a sacral place and a highly symbolic image. Within the methodological framework of ethnic symbolism, this study attempts to explain how this physical/symbolic dichotomy was used to reinforce continuing claims for historical origin and cultural heritage, thus serving the contemporary purpose of national identity and political legitimacy. It also deploys the concept of displacement as a complex process of negotiation between homeland and hostland within an émigré community — whose sense of loss and identity crisis creates additional impetus, though in different forms, for exploiting historical narratives.

memories played in forming his poetic imagination. Displaced by World War II, the poet displays a unique capacity to transcend his traumatic experiences by engaging in creative writing. Eyewitnessing war atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis does not destroy his belief in the healing power of poetry; on the contrary, it makes him appreciate poetry as the only existentially worthy enterprise. Invoking Gaston Bachelard’s classic work The Poetics of Reveries: Childhood, Language, and the Cosmos, I argue that Boichuk’s vivid childhood memories, however painful they might be, helped him poetically recreate and reimagine fateful moments of his migrant life.

The book proves to be an important source of information, previously unknown to scholars, which describes the dramatic and controversial process of constructing Ukrainian identity in the aftermath of World War II. The authors of the study consider the historical and cultural context of the Ukrainian emigration in the second half of the 20th century, its connection with Francoist ideology, and its integral role in the Spanish-Ukrainian cultural dialogue.

Academy at the beginning of the 20th century by reconstructing the spiritual biographies of two theological academy professors: Archimandrite (later, Archbishop
of Berlin and Germany) Tykhon (Tymofii Liashchenko) and Petro Kudriavtsev. The article demonstrates how different cultural traditions intersected and combined in
the spiritual experience of these figures. The author of the article argues that, as a result of revolutionary events in 1917–1919, both Kyiv Theological Academy professors experienced transformations in personal cultural identity, and their spiritual biographies reveal a transition from Russian to Western European and a combination of both (Tykhon (Liashchenko) identities), and from Russian to Ukrainian ideological cultural orientation (Petro Kudriavtsev).
