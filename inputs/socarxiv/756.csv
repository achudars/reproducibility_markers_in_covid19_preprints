Academics, we contend, are experiencing a parallel pressure to engage in self-promotional practices, particularly as universities become progressively more market-driven. Academia.edu, a paper- sharing social network that has been informally dubbed “Facebook for academics,” has grown rapidly by adopting many of the conventions of popular social media sites. This article argues that the astonishing uptake of Academia.edu both reflects and amplifies the self-branding imperatives that many academics experience. Drawing on Academia.edu’s corporate history, design decisions, and marketing communications, we analyze two overlapping facets of Academia.edu: (1) the site’s business model and (2) its social affordances. We contend that the company, like mainstream social networks, harnesses the content and immaterial labor of users under the guise of “sharing.” In addition, the site’s fixation on analytics reinforces a culture of incessant self-monitoring—one already encouraged by university policies to measure quantifiable impact. We conclude by identifying the stakes for academic life, when entrepreneurial and self-promotional demands brush up against the university’s knowledge-making ideals.",TRUE,FALSE,academia.edu|academic life|self-branding|social media,2018-07-02T10:48:26.336732,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-09T21:46:18.070000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/citation/,brxpq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xdc5k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/relationships/node/,xdc5k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5823992cb83f6900457b9b66/,5823992cb83f6900457b9b66,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brxpq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/brxpq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/brxpq,https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305117696523

inauthentically. One explanation is that inauthenticity leads to lower
perceptions of product quality. This stems from the audience's doubt of an
inauthentic actor's capability and commitment to produce high quality
goods. Another explanation is that audiences discount the symbolic value --
or what the good represents -- of goods from inauthentic actors. I
empirically test each of these mechanisms in the craft beer industry.
First, I exploit exogenous variation in consumers' knowledge of craft
brewers' inauthentic identity (whether they are owned by a corporate
brewer) to empirically demonstrate an inauthenticity discount. Next, I
decompose audience evaluations to show that knowledge of a producer's
inauthenticity does not have a statistically significant impact on
evaluators' sensory experience of the product, but that it does affect
audience evaluations of the product's symbolic value.",TRUE,FALSE,authenticity|beer|M&A|preprint|ratings|reviews|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:11.496612,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-08T12:31:38.710000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/citation/,gkyjx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/69vfq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/relationships/node/,69vfq,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5821c5ac9ad5a10049cc701c/,5821c5ac9ad5a10049cc701c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkyjx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gkyjx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gkyjx,NA

It is crucial to understand how this accumulated capital is socialized and passed down the generations through a labour that I argue is gendered in nature, heavily reliant on women, and currently under-researched. In this paper I address this gap ethnographically, focusing on the gendered labour that women perform to sustain and reproduce the dynastic projects of elite families. I compare and contrast the symbolically distant categories of mothers/wives (Ostrander 1984) and ""girls"" - young women who socialize on the VIP scene, as defined by Mears (2015). Both groups involve biologically female bodies deeply involved in the reproduction of elites but the categories they inhabit, the selves that are both ascribed to them and which they choose to present could not be any more different. In light of this data, elite London emerges as a social space structured around strong hierarchies not just of class but also gender. I therefore argue that it is essential to understand more about the interplay of these two structuring principles within elite spaces, focusing on the 'invisible' labour performed by elite women.",TRUE,FALSE,Gender|III|IIIWP|Inequalities|Inequality|Institute|International|LSE|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:05.204703,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-07T15:47:11.210000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/citation/,ewbmx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/44uhq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/relationships/node/,44uhq,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5820a2016c613b01f697e095/,5820a2016c613b01f697e095,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewbmx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewbmx,NA

There are many transformations available, and popular is ‘dummy coding’ in which the estimates represent deviations from a prese- lected ‘reference category’. A way to avoid choosing a reference category is effect coding, where the resulting estimates are deviations from a grand (unweighted) mean. An alternative for effect coding was given by Sweeney and Ulveling in 1972, which provides estimates representing deviations from the sample mean and is especially useful when the data are unbalanced (i.e., categories holding different numbers of observation). Despite its elegancy, this weighted effect coding has been cited only 35 times in the past 40 years, according to Google Scholar citations (more recent references include Hirschberg and Lye 2001 and Gober and Freeman 2005). Furthermore, it did not become a standard option in statistical packages such as SPSS and R. The aim of this paper is to revive weighted effect coding illustrated by recent research on the body mass index (BMI) and to provide easy-to-use syntax for SPSS, R, and Stata on http://www.ru.nl/sociology/mt/wec/ downloads.

This somewhat neglected parameterization is preferred over the well-known effect coding (ANOVA) if the data are unbalanced (i.e., when categories hold different numbers of observations) and was recently revived in this journal (te Grotenhuis et al. 2016). In this paper, we show that weighted effect coding can also be applied to regression models with interaction effects. The weighted effect coded interactions represent the additional effects over and above the main effects obtained from the model without these interactions. This is a useful alternative to effect coding when the data are unbalanced as in most observational data. In this contribution, we describe this novel parameterization and provide syntax, data, and examples in SPSS, R, and Stata on http://www.ru. nl/sociology/mt/wec/downloads.

Most recent empirical analyses of this phenomenon have focused on changes in risk attitudes, and in risk and return expectations but, so far, inconclusive evidence has been provided that changes in those psychological variables play a causal role in the actual decision making at work. Furthermore, the duration of the phenomenon, which is very short, is often not considered and it is thus unclear why the situation recovers so quickly after crises. Relying on experimental data and on a simple agent-based model, we propose an alternative explanation of this phenomenon based on the interaction of the two most important phases that individuals undertake in decision making, namely (1) searching information about possible options and (2) selecting the preferred one. Our main result is that the observed reallocation of portfolios in times of crisis is not the result of a portfolio reassessment driven by the crisis but it is instead explained by changes in search behavior for information on specific market conditions.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-Based Model|Behavioral Finance|Economic Experiment|Financial Crisis|Investment Decision|Non-compensatory Heuristic|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:06.920563,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-01T20:18:58.028000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/citation/,zt3wf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vbcjf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/relationships/node/,vbcjf,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5818f8b39ad5a1004e469397/,5818f8b39ad5a1004e469397,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt3wf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zt3wf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zt3wf,NA

Critical heterosexuality studies demonstrates the role of the traditional, white wedding in the reproduction of heteronormativity and gender and contribute to a social order that privileges white, middle-class, heterosexual married couples over other relationships. On the other hand, social science research points to the ways that same-sex weddings offer a site of resistance to heteronormativity and traditional gender roles. We analyze in-depth interviews with women in straight and same-sex marriages. We find that women in straight marriages are more likely to embrace the traditional, white wedding than those in same-sex marriages. Women planning same-sex weddings think deeply about their wedding ceremonies as they relate to heteronormativity. Some participants reject traditional weddings as excessively costly and wasteful. We argue that, while weddings are often sites for the celebration of consumerism, traditional gender and heterosexuality, they can also be sites of resistance that challenge these same social norms.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:34.570632,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-01T18:39:05.395000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/citation/,e4yst,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/my59r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/relationships/node/,my59r,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5818e14bb83f690044ebeb0f/,5818e14bb83f690044ebeb0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4yst/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4yst/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4yst,NA
