To help resolve this puzzle, we analyze a sample of college entrants in Germany with a discrete choice design that allows for social learning from the experiences of others. We make at least two contributions to the state of research. First, we test whether essentialist gender stereotypes affect major selection mostly through internalization or rather as external constraints that high school graduates adapt their behavior to. Empirically, we find that internalized vocational interests better explain gendered major choices than conformance with friends’ and parents’ expectations does. Second, we scrutinize whether segregation results from women’s anticipation of gendered family roles or from their anticipation of sex-based discrimination, but we find no evidence for either of these hypotheses. As in most previous studies, differences in mathematics achievement fail to explain gendered patterns of selection into college majors.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:47:31.686833,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-01T09:28:46.884000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/citation/,93eyz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ra36n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/relationships/node/,ra36n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5891a9c1594d9001faed1e84/,5891a9c1594d9001faed1e84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93eyz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93eyz/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.12.008,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93eyz

A Test of Devaluation, Human Capital, and Gender Role Theory","As men are overrepresented in lucrative fields and women disproportionately graduate from disciplines that yield low wages in the labor market, horizontal sex segregation in higher education contributes significantly to economic gender inequality. But what underlies the association between sex composition and wages in fields of study? We draw on data from the German HIS Graduate Panel Study 1997 (N=4092) and use hierarchical linear models to adjudicate between devaluation theory and explanations based on differential sorting processes: human capital and gender role theory. The resulting evidence for both human capital and devaluation theory is scant. Consistent with gender role theory, differences in the attractiveness of fields to students with a careerist approach to higher education and the labor market in turn explain most of the association between field of studies’ sex composition and wage levels. We therefore conclude that gendered patterns of self-selection which derive from men’s socialization into the breadwinner role rather than valuative discrimination or rational anticipation of career interruptions underlie the association between fields’ sex composition and wage levels.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:46:25.852067,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-01T09:05:31.457000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/citation/,5u2nn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t4kc5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/relationships/node/,t4kc5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5891a3236c613b01fbcadee6/,5891a3236c613b01fbcadee6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u2nn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5u2nn/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcu060,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5u2nn

Background: Modern couples confront tensions between ideals of mutual interests and values of economic autonomy, a departure from fitting themselves into culturally expected family arrangements of the past. This study teases apart the conditions under which people might prioritize one cultural value over another.

Method: The author conducted a nationally representative survey experiment (N = 3,986 individuals). The respondents selected an income allocation arrangement for a fictional couple with varied relationships investments (i.e., marriage, parenthood, length of relationship) and earning disparities.

Results: Although stronger relationship investments were associated with greater support for sharing all income, the most commonly selected income allocation arrangement was a hybrid arrangement of sharing some income and keeping the rest separate. When respondents preferred some amount of financial autonomy, the primary earner was expected to maintain ownership of a greater amount of the total household income. The preferred level of withholding income was slightly larger in magnitude when women were shown as the primary earner when compared with men shown as the primary earner.

Conclusion: The pursuit of economic autonomy, in combination with beliefs about gender, are important dimensions of gender inequality located within families.",TRUE,FALSE,cohabitation|family|gender inequality|intrahousehold finances|marriage|PAA2017,2018-07-02T10:46:27.780578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-31T20:42:39.531000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/citation/,6aqse,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xtz69/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/relationships/node/,xtz69,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5890f6269ad5a102167a1377/,5890f6269ad5a102167a1377,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6aqse/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6aqse/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12554,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6aqse

Research on community structure in social networks usually focuses on the networks’ statistical properties. There is a need for qualitative studies bridging the gap between network topologies and their sociological implications. To this direction, visual representations of personal networks in social media could be a valuable source of empirical data for qualitative interpretation.

This article reports on a case study that involves the use of many research instruments including questionnaires, classroom observation, and assessment of assignments and exam sheets. This paper tends to suggest a cultural teaching based on standards for intercultural learning elicited from related literature in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) setting, addressed to English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Master students approaching the end of their course of study and getting ready to enter the world of job-market. It proposes ways of instilling multicultural awareness into these language learners through the implementation of intercultural activities, helping them better understanding diversity and developing positive attitudes in the workplace. The research goals comprise increasing students’ intercultural global awareness, promoting their tolerance, and helping them remedy negative attitudes towards the target culture and other alien cultures.

Variations in power exercised by state institutions at the local and national level have implications for the tactics that movements adopt. We examine the Right to Food Campaign in India, an informal network of organizations and individuals across local and national levels, which targets the state for entitlement to 
food. Using the interim orders of the Supreme Court in 2001, the campaign converted welfare initiatives for children into legal entitlements for access to nutritious food by holding state officials accountable at the local level; it also worked towards the enactment of the National Food Security Act of 2013. The campaign impacts local, national and global institutions, such as the WTO which expressed its disagreement with welfare provisions in the NFSA. 

Our analysis has three main implications. First, we note that the state is not a monolithic whole but comprises institutions at national and subnational levels (country, state, county or district, and village), all of which may not always work towards the same goal. Second, we argue that the state’s implementation of neoliberal policies that deny subsistence rights of the poor results in localized resistances that are linked to national and global protests. Third, a temporal lens on local and national politics is important to understanding the dynamics between local struggles and state institutions.

Although we agree that family processes are important, we think that these explanations downplay the structure of families (nuclear, extended) and thereby the ways in which gender relations are organized. In this paper, domestic violence is explored as an intra-family dynamic that extends beyond the intimate partner relationship and which seeps into court rulings of cases of such violence. 


Methodology/approach: Using archival data from 164 Supreme Court case decisions on domestic violence in India for the period 1995–2011, we examine both the patterns of conviction and the complexities of gender relations within the family by systematically coding the Court’s rulings. 

Findings :Analysis of court rulings show that mothers-in-law were convicted in 14% cases and the husband was convicted in 41% cases. We call attention to the collective nature of the domestic violence crime in India where mothers-in-law were seldom convicted alone (3% of cases) but were more likely to be convicted along with other members of the family. Two dominant themes we discuss are the gendered nature of familial relations beyond the intimate partner relationship and the pervasiveness of such gendered relationships from the natal home to the marital family making victims of domestic violence isolated and “homeless.” 

Research limitations/implication:Future research may benefit from using data in addition to the judgments to consider caste and class differences in the rulings. An intersectionality perspective may add to the understanding of the interpretation of the laws by the courts. 

Social implications: Insights from this paper have important policy implications. As discussed in the paper, the unintended support for violence from the natal family is an indication of their powerlessness and therefore further victimization through the law will not help. It is critical that natal families re-frame their powerlessness which is often derived from their status as families with daughters. Considering that most women in India turn to their natal families first for support when they face violence in their marriages, policy must enable such families to act and utilize the law. 

Originality/value : By examining court rulings on cases of domestic violence in India we focus on the power exerted by some women particularly within extended families which is central to understanding gender relations within institutions. These relations are legitimized by the courts in the ways they interpret the law and rule on cases.",TRUE,FALSE,Domestic Violence|Gender|India|Law|Violence,2018-07-02T10:47:33.760423,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-28T22:13:18.026000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/citation/,9qwfg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tbrby/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/relationships/node/,tbrby,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588b667b6c613b01f86adb79/,588b667b6c613b01f86adb79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9qwfg/,https://doi.org/10.1108/S1530-353520150000009003,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9qwfg

to Japan’s relationship vis à vis China, he was positing the idea that Japan should
hedge. Samuels identified a need for Japan to grow stronger whilst avoiding growing
sufficiently powerful as to pose a threat to China, while simultaneously positioning
itself not too close and not too far from the United States, its security guarantor. In
short, Japan should aim to get the relationship ‘just right’, hence the faerie—tale
analogy. Moving further south within Asia, an examination of the evolving
relationship between Vietnam and China shows this is precisely the strategy Vietnam
is adopting vis à vis China, albeit within an entirely different security dynamic. In
essence, Vietnam's hedging strategy, comprising what Goh has defined as a form of
“triangular politics” between Vietnam, China and the United States, is a strategy
predicated on working for the best whilst preparing for the worst. It is a strategy
that seeks to combine a mixture of balancing, containment, engagement and
enmeshment as a form of insurance against an uncertain strategic future.

This paper will argue that, due to Thayer’s “tyranny of geography’ – where
Vietnam's shared northern continental border and their long snaking eastern littoral
coastline bordering the South China Sea have inevitably thrown Vietnam's and
China's interests together – Vietnam is more threatened by China's rise than any
other regional state. As Goh states, “the tyranny of geography renders the two
countries strategic rivals.” Consequently, as China continues to rise, this paper
argues that Vietnam will increasingly seek to hedge with the United States,
increasing military and security ties with the western hegemon as part of a nuanced
strategy, which also includes engagement with China (particularly through growing
trade and economic ties); which seeks to enmesh China in multilateral institutions
within the regional security architecture; and which seeks to strengthen its own
security position through a program of military modernisation and selective military
expansion. This nuanced strategy we shall call hedging.",TRUE,FALSE,Asymmetric power relations|Bilateral relations|China|Hedging strategy|International Relations|Strategic studies|Vietnam,2018-07-02T10:53:46.883777,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-27T00:45:22.481000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/citation/,w8q7b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rdqg2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/relationships/node/,rdqg2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588a9627b83f6901eea69631/,588a9627b83f6901eea69631,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8q7b/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8q7b

This body of work shows that wives are more likely than husbands to offer support to a depressed spouse. Moreover, when wives are depressed, they are more likely than husbands to try and shield their spouse from the stress of their own depression. Yet, previous research has not examined depression and relationship dynamics in gay and lesbian couples. We analyze in-depth interviews with 26 gay and lesbian couples (N = 52 individuals) in which one or both partners reported depression. We find evidence that dominant gender scripts are both upheld and challenged within gay and lesbian couples, providing important insight into how gender operates in relation to depression within same-sex contexts. Our results indicate that most gay and lesbian partners offer support to a depressed partner, yet lesbian couples tend to follow a unique pattern in that they provide support both as the non-depressed and depressed partner. Support around depression is sometimes viewed as improving the relationship, but if the support is intensive or rejected, it is often viewed as contributing to relationship strain. Support is also sometimes withdrawn by the non-depressed partner because of caregiver exhaustion or the perception that the support is unhelpful. This study points to the importance of considering depression within gay and lesbian relational contexts, revealing new ways support sustains and strains intimate partnerships. We emphasize the usefulness of deploying couple-level approaches to better understand depression in sexual minority populations.",TRUE,FALSE,depression|intimate relationships|LGBT|qualitative methods|romantic relationships|social support,2018-07-02T10:48:28.144527,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-26T16:55:09.580000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/citation/,cf8c2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bpmw3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/relationships/node/,bpmw3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588a28ce594d9001f79fb3a2/,588a28ce594d9001f79fb3a2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cf8c2/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.048,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cf8c2
