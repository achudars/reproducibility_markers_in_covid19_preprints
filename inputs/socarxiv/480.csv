However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to investigate the role of subtitling and dubbing in vocabulary acquisition has been carried out in the Arab world. The aim of the present study is to measure the effect of Audiovisual Translation modalities, mainly subtitling and dubbing, in the acquisition of Arabic vocabulary in an Arabic as a foreign language class (AFL) carried out at Sultan Qaboos College for Teaching Arabic For Non-Native Speakers. In order to do this a couple of questions needed answers 1) Which modality (subtitling and/or dubbing) is more conducive to vocabulary acquisition in the Arabic language? And 2) Which modality is more efficient in the long-term memory retention of Arabic vocabulary? Thirty upper intermediate students participated in this case study, which involved them watching a four-minute clip of the American TV series Designated Survivor in three versions: (a) subtitled into Arabic, (b) dubbed into Arabic, and (c) dubbed and subtitled in Arabic. The results showed that all groups were able to acquire and retain second language (L2) vocabulary; however, the dubbing group achieved higher results in both the immediate post-test and the delayed post-test.",TRUE,FALSE,dubbing|education|language learning|subtitling|vocabulary acquisition,2019-07-25T19:12:22.393528,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:12:05.819099,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/citation/,5bya4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f44c362c82a0018d80950/,5c6f44c362c82a0018d80950,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bya4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5bya4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5bya4

This paper carefully examines the most widely-read translations of particle هل as held up through the Quran. It is a critique of the translation of the Quran. Contrary to the long-standing concept which perceives هل as solely an interrogative particle, this paper crosses t’s and dots i’s in relation to focusing translators’ attention on other almost-overlooked linguistic functions carried by هل, i.e. corroborative, negative and imperative. It is found that particle هل in all contexts is dealt with from the same perspective in the translations. This entails the translators’ failure to understand the inconsistent linguistic behaviors of هل. This paper has put efforts to plumb the depths of identifying the different functions expressed by هل, which have long stood in the face of translators, a knotty problem that has long escaped the notice of translators, and thus yielded inaccurate renditions of the هل.

As an unmarried female sovereign and being cognizant of her vulnerability, she employed a discourse of contradiction, an instrumental political asset to challenge Renaissance gender expectations. The discrepancy in Elizabeth’s rhetoric is evident in her speeches, prayers, and poetry. This research suggests that the process of self- representation was carefully and skillfully attained through the projection of conflicting depictions. It explores three erratic depictions: masculine and feminine, virgin and mother, and divine and human. This project provides evidence that in her struggle with her gender and with the Renaissance culture, Elizabeth's rhetorical strategy was the creation of paradoxical images, arguing that this clever tactic allowed her to circumvent the issue of gender, legitimize her rule, and craft a unique regal identity.

Research in translating social media posts has recently received a greater attention among translation studies specialists. This paper looks firstly at Twitter as a growing social media networking and its language and, secondly, shedding some light on translation strategies used in translating English tweets into Arabic. Posts on Twitter, ‘tweets,’ by well-known figures are followed, translated, and reposted in other languages every day. Strategies used by Arab translators vary depending on the importance of the tweet as well as the ideology of the translator and the institutions they work for. This paper, therefore, investigates the translation strategies adopted by the Arab online news agencies, mentioned later, on their web pages in translating some tweets posted by the American President, Donald Trump in his first month of presidency.

Poetical Translation of Poetry (English-Arabic),"The translation of poetry has been and will continue to be an issue of great concern to translators, men of letters and readers. Poetry has been approached differently by translators. They are divided into two major parties: tone insists on translating poetry into poetry with respect to all prosodic features; another suggests translating sense with no concern in prosody, especially rhyme, rhm, meter and foot, especially when the translator is for some good reason, unable to translate a poem into a poen in the target language(TL). Each party has their own justifications for their claim. This Paper attempts to demonstrate the merits and demerits  of both approaches at translating one and the same poem in terms of poetic translation for the former, and poetical translation for the latter. The aim behind that is two fold: first to satisfy all types of readers; second, to provide concrete evidence for the argument put forward throughout the whole Paper, which is poetic translation is superceding poetical translation in Arabic for Arab readers who still highly appreciate the aestheticity and poeticity of poetry. At the end of the day, it is left to readers to decide which version to prefer. At times, more than one poetic version of translation are suggested for the same poem by different translators. Still on one or two occasions, a middle way version combining some features of each of poetical and poetic translations, is proposed. It is termed as a ‘semi-poetic’ translation, with the ultimate objective of drawing a comparison between the different versions of translation of the same poem to give readers the opportunity to judge for themselves which translation they go for and why. Convincing readers is a daunting ask, but rewarding at the end.

Where intersections would typically be open to two-way traffic, in hundreds in cases in St. Louis they have been closed using concrete barriers or cul-de-sacs. These street closures are the outgrowth of a 1970s-era “defensible space” strategy to address rising crime rates. Oscar Newman, who is most closely associated with this paradigm, developed it while a faculty member in St. Louis. The city therefore is not only the birthplace but also one of the most significant test cases for its implementation. In this paper, we provide the most comprehensive data set of closures available, evaluate their location in the city, and assess their association with contemporary violent crime patterns. We find that barriers are located in neighborhoods that lost significant population between 1970 and 2016, particularly in North City and the northernmost reaches of South City. Critically, though the barriers are imagined as crime reduction tools and justified as such in City legislation, we find that they are associated with elevated violent crime rates at the neighborhood-level.

Scholars agree that the news media are key to movement organizations’ influence, helping them alter public discourse and effect political change, but often find that protest is covered non-substantively. Employing insights from literatures on historical institutionalism, the social organization of the news, and the consequences of movements, we elaborate an “institutional mediation” model that identifies the interactive effects on coverage of news institutions’ operating procedures, movement organizations’ characteristics and action, and political contexts.  Although movement actors suffer compound legitimacy deficits with journalists, the institutional mediation model identifies the openings news institutions provide, the movement organizational characteristics and collective action likely to induce substantive news treatment, and the political contexts that will amplify or dampen these effects. We derive four interactive hypotheses from this model addressing organizational identities, collective action, and political contexts on news outcomes.  We appraise the hypotheses with comparative and qualitative comparative analyses of more than 1000 individually coded articles discussing the five most-covered organizations of the 1960s U.S. civil rights movement across four national newspapers.

While systems of informal control are by their very nature more decentralized and unorganized, can systems of informal social control come to resemble centralized systems of formal control? This article offers a highly detailed empirical analysis of a particular form of informal social control in a highly observable setting over time: fist-fighting in the National Hockey League. Fighting is commonly understood to be both an instrument of retaliatory “self-help” exercised by all players, but also the semi-exclusive domain of “enforcers” or “goons” who are employed by teams to physically retaliate on behalf of their opponents and deter violent play in others. A 52-year record of nearly 30,000 fist fights between players is analyzed alongside other player statistics. An analysis of the player distribution, network structure, and in-game contexts of these fights demonstrates a gradual shift from a system of self-help to a system of specialized enforcement. This shift is connected to larger changes in the size of the league and the talent pool, processes of specialization at the level of the team, and the emergence of an unofficial “enforcer” role that motivates participation in fights for certain players.",TRUE,FALSE,hockey|sanctioning|social control|social networks,2019-02-22T04:23:28.401736,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-22T04:23:00.690492,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/citation/,j9qpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6eb3ca82a395001ac91d7f/,5c6eb3ca82a395001ac91d7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9qpd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9qpd

Assuming a temporally unidirectional environment, our theory describes an intelligent agent as one who aims to perform intelligent acts. The intelligent act is an ongoing attempt made by an agent to predict the future of the self as well as the future of the part or whole of the entire environment. However, the outcome is always uncertain. Our theory categorizes human behavior into intelligent and non-intelligent actions. 
Applying this categorization on literary texts enables us to continuously portray characters as intelligent or non-intelligent entities based on their actions. This approach helps redefine the way we perceive agency in characters’ progression. By investigating depictions of uncertainties in characters, we consider characters as entities who are able to rupture conventions governing the need for character coherence and narrative closure in literary texts. Therefore, we hope that readers will be able to accept stories that are not only at odds with the characters themselves but also with the readers.",TRUE,FALSE,characterization|intelligence|intelligent act|prediction|uncertainty,2019-02-21T00:05:08.155872,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-21T00:04:29.141222,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/citation/,g78mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6ddcd262c82a0018d71f6c/,5c6ddcd262c82a0018d71f6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g78mf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g78mf

We take up the three empirical dimensions of self-determination that Ryan and Deci have distinguished in their motivational theory of psychological self-determination and transpose them to the collective level. On the dimension of autonomy, collective self-determination refers to the institutions and rules of a democratic communication order; on the competence dimension, it refers to citizens’ political efficacy beliefs; and on the dimension of social connectedness, collective self-determination denotes the existence of shared communicative spaces even across deep divides. This conception of self-determination allows us, on the one hand, to identify causal influences between the individual and collective levels and, on the other hand, helps bring into focus the problems of realizing self-determination in societal communication as well as potentials for their solution. In conclusion, we show how the contributions to this special issue relate to the three empirical dimensions and two levels of self-determination and highlight their respective normative relevance.",TRUE,FALSE,autonomy|competence|digital communication|empirical research|normative theory|self-determination|social connectedness,2019-02-20T15:36:48.624628,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20T15:23:01.306316,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/citation/,s28yb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d6f6282a395001ac84e0c/,5c6d6f6282a395001ac84e0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s28yb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s28yb/,https://doi.org/10.5771/1615-634X-2018-4-395,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s28yb
