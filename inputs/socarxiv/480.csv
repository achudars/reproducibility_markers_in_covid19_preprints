Yet critical debate related to the use of ‘everyday’ stop and search powers by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has, despite the hyper-accountable policing system of Northern Ireland, been marked by its absence. This paper presents the first ever analysis of PSNI’s use of PACE-type powers - currently used at a higher rate and with poorer outcomes compared to the rest of the U.K. While it can only be considered as an elusive power, about which detailed research evidence is markedly lacking, stop and search in Northern Ireland seems to serve as a classificatory tool for PSNI to control mainly young, socio-economically marginal male populations. The paper provides new theoretical insight into stop and search as a simultaneous overt and covert practice, and speaks to wider issues of mundane police power – and practice – within highly contested and politically fractured contexts.

The Virú state developed around 200 BC and is the earliest known state on the north coast of Peru. The settlement patterns and settlement hierarchies of the Virú Period (ca. 200 BC – 600 AD) are compared with those of the earlier Puerto Morin Period (ca. 400 – 200 BC) to investigate processes of territorial expansion. Two independent polities and several outlying communities occupied the valley during the Puerto Morin Period whereas settlement during the Virú Period was extensive, populations surged, and large swaths of the valley were settled for the first time. Evidence is presented to show that the Virú state incorporated the earlier Puerto Morin polities and that a three-tiered settlement hierarchy existed at this time. Drawing from cross-cultural evidence and recent studies on Virú expansionary dynamics, I propose a hypothesis that the Virú state expanded rapidly throughout the valley early in its developmental history and pursued a policy of territorial consolidation later in its history.

Research in communicative approach to language has shown that competence in oral and written language grows as the learners actively use the language in and out of the classroom. The aim of this paper is to engage learners in activities that demand their autonomous participation and develop linguistic competence and learner autonomy. The vital question every teacher has to ponder upon is “Can we expect what was taught in the previous class is retained in the next class?” The present study focuses on how films can aid in enhancing ELT in the GFP in Oman. The research data collected will be empirical and qualitative in nature. GFP students will be the main subjects of this research. The research will be carried out on different levels and groups in the GFP. The activities based on films expose the learners to authentic language input, help them learn how language operates and challenge them to use the language independently. The rich visual imagery, the action and motions of the films deliver the learners with multi-sensory involvement (Arcario, 1993). Infusing technology into Education serves a variety of purposes in language teaching. The observation of cultural aspects such as traditions helps to understand the function of the language. By this pragmatic approach an innovative teacher can aid students’ critical thinking skills as well as their linguistic competence.

Hence, the paper aims to demonstrate how literary texts can be employed in the English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom to facilitate reading, language acquisition, and related critical skills, particularly at the pre-intermediate stage and above. Text selections from popular novels were analysed using Johns and Davies’ (1983) Text as Vehicle of Information (TAVI), and Text as Linguistic Object (TALO), as well as Clandfield’s (2005) Text as Springboard for Production (TASP) as a framework to design language learning/use activities. Source texts were selected from Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day, Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, and Martel’s Life of Pi in view of these novels’ current salience in the literary world to address key research questions: 1) What reading skills and sub-skills can the literary texts help develop among ESL/EFL students? 2) What aspects of grammar and vocabulary can be exploited in the texts? 3) How can the texts be used as reflections of social reality to generate discussion of critical issues among students? The fact that these novels have been produced as films, which the learners could also watch in whole or part, is expected to stimulate further critical appreciation. The paper concludes that the value of such informed use of any literary text is that it exploits the literature-language nexus to provide the synergy needed for student learning in the ESL/EFL classroom and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-21T13:24:21.271772,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:24:03.845011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/citation/,hq528,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j8ynd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/relationships/node/,j8ynd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b602bd4676c0017abcfff/,5b7b602bd4676c0017abcfff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hq528/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hq528/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hq528,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.9

Results of the current study refer to the extent to which EFL teachers consider TSD topics, purposes, and considerations to be proper or improper. Moreover, the study finds out concurrence and indifference between male and female teachers' conceptions in topics of TSD, the purposes TSD achieves in classroom settings, and considerations the teachers consider when practicing TSD.

Benchmarks are necessary for improving the quality of instruction. Considering the importance of benchmarking and taking it as a point of reference, a small study was undertaken at the Centre for Preparatory Studies to develop benchmarks for each course offered in the General Foundation Program. One of the aims of developing benchmarks was to make it clear to students what is expected of them at the end of each course. The study draws on some examples of benchmarking models to draft benchmarks for the purpose of study. The exploratory method was followed for gaining insights to write benchmarks. Literature review showed that course objectives are used synonymously with benchmarks. The outcomes of the research project played a significant role in designing curricula for the GFP courses though it was quite a challenging task. It is important to draft concise and clear benchmarks, which are accessible and comprehensible for students and teachers. So, using the level-specific proficiency descriptors, can-do statements for each skill bench markers were written to make it comprehensible for students to know what is expected of them by the end of each course.

One such tool is the use of an electronic portfolio, also known as a digital portfolio or an ePortfolio. This paper demonstrates how ePortfolios support formative assessment in a language classroom. An electronic portfolio could serve as a pedagogical tool to prevent plagiarism, as it is one of the authentic ways to assess the students’ performance during the course. Introducing ePortfolios at tertiary level can bring about the much-needed change in teaching, learning and assessment methods contributing to students’ academic success. The aim of the study was to enhance student learning by introducing ePortfolios to English for Special Purposes (ESP) learners at undergraduate level. The study explores the piloting of ePortfolio in ESP module for undergraduate students at a private college in Oman as part of the formative assessment in an attempt to prevent plagiarism and also to motivate the learners to showcase their coursework in a digital format. A qualitative and quantitative survey was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the practice and the results of the study indicate that the learners seem to have recognized the learning potential of ePortfolios, as their response to the above mentioned assessment method was quite positive. The findings of this study serve as a determining factor in deciding whether ePortfolios could effectively be used as a formative assessment tool for academic courses in the specific learning environment.",TRUE,FALSE,academic ePortfolios|english for special purposes|ePortfolios|formative assessment|higher education|plagiarism,2018-08-21T13:26:20.929750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:26:05.629944,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/citation/,45hqr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/du2gy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/relationships/node/,du2gy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b5dfad4676c0019abc416/,5b7b5dfad4676c0019abc416,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45hqr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/45hqr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/45hqr,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.6

Academic, Social and Emotional elevation through Peer Tutoring","Peer tutoring or peer assisted learning is an effective instructional strategy that involves active and interactive participative learning process resulting in a deeper understanding of concepts for both ‘Tutors’ and ‘Tutees’.  The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of peer tutoring on Academic achievements of the students in the General Foundation and Undergraduate Programmes at a private college in Oman. It will further explore other advantages, especially social and emotional benefits, the tutors and tutees may gain by taking part in peer tutoring programme held at Middle East College, Oman. The study was conducted through an online survey, personal interviews and judging the in-class performances of these students. The results revealed some interesting benefits for both the ‘Tutors’ and the ‘Tutees’. For the ‘Tutors’ it was a bolstering experience as it led to increased knowledge and skills; self-confidence; and a sense of responsibility. The ‘Tutees’ on the other hand developed – (i) a better liking for the subject concerned; (ii) better cooperation skills among their peers; (iii) increased motivation to study a particular subject; (iv) better communication Skills; (v) better stress management; and (vi) confidence. Peer tutoring is seen as a great advantage to gain learner autonomy to reap the full benefits of academic life by nurturing innate talent and abilities. The shift from teacher-led to student-centered classes has been hailed as a milestone in order to foster learner autonomy and productive learning.",TRUE,FALSE,|academic support|at-risk|feedback|flexible environment|learner autonomy|peer assisted learning,2018-08-21T13:26:41.576063,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:26:25.262897,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/citation/,jph6t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yq9x8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/relationships/node/,yq9x8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b5bba2da7bb001a708f01/,5b7b5bba2da7bb001a708f01,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jph6t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jph6t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jph6t,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.5
