loglinear models of tables of spouse pairs properly capture evidence of the  preferences behind assortative mating. Can we tell what sort of mechanisms bring about the patterns we see? Is there a female hypergamy preference and do loglinear models capture it? Four different ideal-typical simulations of spouse choice processes are presented: homophily, competition, social segregation, time segregation. All produce ""realistic"" patterns of educational assortative mating.  Imposing a simulated female hypergamy preference yields more asymmetric outcomes, directly detected in loglinear models. But the relationship between the size of the hypergamy estimate and the strength of the hypergamy differs according to the pairing mechanism. Notably, for homophily the estimate is lower, and for time-segregation higher. Indeed, for zero simulated hypergamy, the homophily simulation shows negative, and the time-segregation simulation positive, hypergamy. This is shown to be due to the dynamic nature of the simulations: as individuals pair off the distribution of single individuals changes. For homophily perfectly symmetric choices at each iteration sum into a table of spouse pairs in which loglinear models detect hypogamy.  Conclusions: these biases are small, and depend on very large simulation populations. They are less likely to be detectable in typical survey data. However, we demonstrate a clear mechanism by which loglinear models of tables of spouse pairs can be biased. This suggests that if longitudinal data is available, a time dimension should be included in the loglinear models. Otherwise, this is another argument for preferring tables of recent marriages.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based simulation|assortative mating|female hypergamy|loglinear models,2019-07-10T20:05:49.808942,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10T20:05:23.588578,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/citation/,km4hn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d248c68114a420019021401/,5d248c68114a420019021401,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km4hn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/km4hn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/km4hn,NA

We layer these images with a published, geo-referenced collection of Land Survey Maps of China (1903–1948), which includes the earliest large-scale maps of major cities and regions in China that are produced with modern cartographic techniques. By bringing together historical illustrations depicting spatial configurations of localities and the earliest modern cartographic maps, researchers of Chinese history can study the different spatial epistemologies represented in both collections. We report our workflow for creating this web GIS platform, starting from identifying and extracting visual materials from local gazetteers, tagging them with keywords and categories to facilitate content search, to georeferencing them based on their source locations. We also experimented with neural networks to train a tagger with positive results. Finally, we display them in the web GIS platform with two modes, Images in Map (IIM) and Maps in Map (MIM), and with content- and location-based filtering.

However, the use of these umbrella-concepts in educational contexts has caused issues when used in conjunction with concepts such as affordances and integration. In this paper, eight Chinese preservice early childhood teachers’ perceptions of ICT and its affordances are explored through online interviews. The participants conceptualised ‘ICT’ as screen-based technologies such as interactive whiteboards and computers. These technologies were perceived to afford efficiency and assistance, particularly for teacher-centred practice, but to constrain children’s tactile and direct hands-on experience. The results highlight the importance of sociocultural contexts (e.g. practicum places and educational traditions) in shaping preservice teachers’ perceptions of technology and technology use.

Why are these aspects meaningful for young children? The findings suggest that children are not mere passive consumers of digital games but are agentic meaning-makers who are capable of critically evaluating digital games when a safe, and supportive space and the appropriate medium are provided. The children refined, modified, and personalized existing influential games by replacing the leading male character with a female one or by having a player operate as the antagonist instead of the hero.

Subsequently, I examined my limited files and found evidence that we: 1) included hundreds of duplicates, 2) underreported the number of counties, and 3) somehow added another 316 respondents right before publication (and over a year after the survey was conducted) without changing nearly any of the reported statistics (means, standard deviations, regression coefficients). The survey company confirmed that it sent us only 500 respondents, not the 1,184 reported in the article. I obtained and reanalyzed those data. This report presents the findings from my reanalysis, which suggest that the sample was not just duplicated. The data were also altered—intentionally or unintentionally—in other ways, and those alterations produced the article’s main findings. Additionally, we misreported data characteristics as well as aspects of our analysis and findings, and we failed to report the use of imputation for missing data. The following eight findings emerged from my reanalysis:

1)	The article reports 1,184 respondents, but actually there are 500. 
2)	The article reports 91 counties, but actually there are 326.
3)	The article describes respondents that differ substantially from those in the data.
4)	The article reports two significant interaction effects, but actually there are none.  
5)	The article reports the effect of Hispanic growth is significant and positive, but actually it is non-significant and negative.  
6)	The article reports many other findings that do not exist in the data.
7)	The standard errors are stable in our published article, but not in the actual data or in articles published by other authors using similar modeling techniques with large samples.
8)	Although never mentioned in the article, 208 of the 500 respondents in the data (or 42%) have imputed values.",TRUE,FALSE,Professional standards|Public opinion|Racial threat|Replication|Research ethics,2019-07-06T22:22:01.874245,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-06T22:21:48.682445,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Justin Pickett,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/citation/,9b2k3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rewv7/,rewv7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d20f47cce16db001a5aa464/,5d20f47cce16db001a5aa464,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b2k3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9b2k3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9b2k3,NA

Thankfully, new computational tools have enabled the testing and visualization of complex ideas in an easily packageable format. In this article we illustrate not only how agent-based modeling provides a platform for communicating complex ideas, but also how these game-like computer models can be explored and manipulated by members of the public therefore increasing their engagement in archaeological explanations. We suggest that these new digital tools serve as an excellent aid for education on the importance of archaeological sites and artifacts. To illustrate the above we walk the reader through a step-by-step pipeline of how to run an ABM model as an experiment and how to export it into a form ready to be sent to SHPO and THPO offices in tandem with reports. Ultimately, we hope that this work will help demystify the computational archaeology process and lead to more fluency in using agent-based modeling in research and outreach.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|computers|CRM|models|outreach|policy|SHPO|THPO,2019-07-06T02:26:41.473979,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-06T02:26:25.818345,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/citation/,9uw6j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/459mr/,459mr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d1f5263ce16db001c59e562/,5d1f5263ce16db001c59e562,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uw6j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9uw6j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9uw6j,https://doi.org/10.1017/aap.2019.4
