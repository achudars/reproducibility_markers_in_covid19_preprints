Exchanges, control &amp; capital markets in authoritarian capitalism","A growing body of research has analyzed the variegation of financialization processes and the role of states as important actors therein.  Contributing to this literature, this paper argues that more than important actors facilitating financialization, states can also (partially) exert control over, actively manage and shape financialization. In the context of China’s variegated financialization process, this paper analyzes the crucial role of securities exchanges in the development of China’s capital markets since the global financial crisis 2007–09. These state-owned exchanges act as intermediaries between the Chinese state, society and finance by shaping the infrastructural arrangements of capital markets. Thereby, they facilitate the authorities’ ability to control markets and direct their outcomes towards state policies. Financialization is thereby decoupled from a neoliberal policy paradigm, and rather than a break with China’s authoritarian capitalism, exchanges facilitate state control within and through financialization.",TRUE,FALSE,authoritarian capitalism|capital markets|China|financialization|market infrastructures|securities exchanges,2019-12-18T14:06:44.244065,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-18T14:06:29.394234,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/citation/,kcp3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df92f0d1abedf000aa84031/,5df92f0d1abedf000aa84031,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kcp3g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kcp3g,NA

Methods: I use data from the 1989-2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) linked to the National Death Index (NDI) through 2002. Analyses assess how match score and match class vary by ethnicity, nativity, and age and whether mortality hazard ratios are sensitive to shifts in match criteria. Results: Linkage quality is lower for Hispanic and foreign-born adults than for non-Hispanic white and U.S.-born adults. Modification of the linkage criteria determine whether or not the Hispanic mortality advantage is observed among middle-aged adults.

This includes the different forms of abuse and intimidation that the Act seeks to address. As part of its functions as the Approved Agency, Netsafe has conducted the first in a series of Annual Population Surveys (APS). The objective of the APS is to gauge attitudes and behaviours and to start monitoring national trends regarding potentially harmful digital communications in Aotearoa-New Zealand. This report presents the main findings of the 2017 APS. The APS is the first nationally representative study that looks at adult New Zealanders and digital communications in the context of the Act. Key aspects of the Act - such as the communication principles - and key internet safety concepts have informed the development of the research instrument and the analysis of its findings.

The study was planned and administered by Netsafe between February and September 2017. An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,018 adult New Zealanders (aged 18 ) between 30 May and 30 June 2017. Data collection was conducted by Colmar Brunton. The maximum margin of error for the whole population is ±3.1% at the 95% confidence level.

The study provides insights regarding New Zealanders’ access to and use of digital technologies. It also explores people’s level of awareness of the Act. A key focus of the study is to measure participants’ experiences of digital communications, including perceptions and experiences of harm and distress in the last 12 months. Finally, the study presents relevant insights regarding New Zealanders’ personal responses, and access to services and resources to deal with unwanted digital communications as well as potential harm and distress.

As research on adult New Zealanders and their experiences with digital communications is limited, the APS provides first-hand research evidence on this subject to government agencies, online content and service providers, law enforcement, the research community, and the general public. However, considering the evolving nature of new technologies and how people engage with digital tools, new online challenges and risks are likely to emerge. Thus, the study of the nature and impact of digital communications, including potential harm and distress, will remain a relevant but challenging area of research, analysis, and policy intervention.",TRUE,FALSE,cyber abuse|cyberbullying|digital communication internet|digital communications|online harm|online harrassment|quantitative research|social media|survey|technology,2019-12-18T21:41:02.019224,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-18T21:40:37.046510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/citation/,g6ctw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df80cc09a7ce3000a62820b/,5df80cc09a7ce3000a62820b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ctw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ctw,NA

Race is assumed to be self-evident, and merit is no exception. Merit’s reality is not questioned as it is something that is obvious and identifiable within an academic evaluative culture. While scholars note that the definitions of merit reflect the societal elite's cultural norms and definitions of merit transformed to justify racial hierarchies in the U.S., scholars have seldom questioned the racial assumptions upon which these merit transformations take place. Specifically, what have the transformations in merit within the U.S. academy had to presume about race, its role in the social world, and how it operates within the U.S. academy? Conducting a knowledge culture analysis of merit within the academy from 1890 until present, the study argues the contemporary academic evaluative culture has inherited a presumption of the twentieth-century academic evaluative cultures: adjudications of merit are premised upon the colonized proving their assimilability. The colonized have served as fundamental backdrop for how to judge merit because merit in academia’s social world emerged as a language and technology to manage the inclusion of racial difference; or simply, merit as race talk. This myopia makes it so academic evaluative cultures do not question whether the study of merit is the same as the colonial study of intelligence. Given this myopia, academia could begin to explore alternative bases of merit knowledge that are not dependent on adjudicating colonized communities' worth.",TRUE,FALSE,colonialism|culture|higher education|knowledge|racial theory|white supremacy,2019-12-16T03:49:20.941048,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-16T03:49:04.467644,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/citation/,9bwu5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df6a433835f3f000db402be/,5df6a433835f3f000db402be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9bwu5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9bwu5,NA

We develop a relational understanding of how social relations, culture, and conflict are interwoven. Using this framework, we examine how combatants' associations with cultural elements affect the interpersonal relationships underlying conflict dynamics, as well as how these relationships engender associations to cultural elements. To do so, we first introduce a novel analytical approach that synthesizes computational textual analysis and stochastic actor-oriented models of longitudinal networks. We then use our approach to analyze a two-level socio-semantic graph representing both the cultural domain and social relationships of prominent militants operating in one Afghan province, Balkh, between 1979 and 2001. Our results indicate that militants' interpersonal comradeships rely, in part, on their connections to cultural elements and relative power. Comradeship, in turn, fosters militants' connections to cultural elements. We conclude by discussing how conflict studies can continue to build on insights from cultural sociology, as well as how cultural sociology and socio-semantic network research can benefit from further engaging conflict studies and developing our analytical approach. We also highlight provisional insights into endogenous mechanisms of conflict resolution and cultural change.",TRUE,FALSE,Conflict|Culture|Socio-semantic networks|Stochastic actor-oriented models|Topic Models,2019-12-16T03:48:20.961142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-16T03:48:07.635607,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/citation/,xbjm2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df682785eb0bc000c76457a/,5df682785eb0bc000c76457a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbjm2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbjm2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.101403

Despite this, no research had been conducted on the prevalence of the sharing of nudes among young New Zealanders. This study addresses this and raises important questions for all those with a role in supporting young people’s healthy development. We believe this report makes an important contribution to the overall understanding of young people’s experience of these behaviours. However, it only provides a snapshot, and more work is required to understand how best to support young people as they navigate the challenges and potential risks. This report is being released as part of a larger project exploring young people’s experiences of digital risk and harm, carried out by a partnership between Netsafe and the Ministry for Women.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescents|internet|mobile devices|New Zealand|nude sharing|quantitative|sexting|sexually explicit content|social media|survey|teens,2019-12-16T15:13:44.777971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-16T15:13:23.875488,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/citation/,2r4mj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df475d6f7ca8e000c9ac5c9/,5df475d6f7ca8e000c9ac5c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2r4mj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2r4mj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2r4mj,NA
