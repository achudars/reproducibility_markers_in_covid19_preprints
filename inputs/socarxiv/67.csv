It builds on the concept of trichotomy – division of students based on creamy-level, middle-level and weaker-level students -- proposed by the present authors. A sequenced series of formative assessments can map student progress and achievement, particularly in the case of weaker students. The idea behind the development of this model is to study if weak students perform better on critical-thinking tests in a collaborative learning setting rather than when they study individually. We propose a mathematical model to measure group activity/achievement, which is a complex function of several parameters. We collect data on different parameters for validation of the model in the near future.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-11T11:01:05.103564,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T11:00:48.626468,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/citation/,e2n5y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6049922d474b1e0021ca7e79/,6049922d474b1e0021ca7e79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2n5y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2n5y/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.184,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2n5y

The order of discovery of these ideas of the ultimate constituents of matter was necessary, in that they could not have been discovered in any other order. This was because nature has a particular structure and we have a particular place in nature. The traditional view of the elements could be obtained by naked eye observation, and the view of nature as being made up of the chemical elements in the periodic table was next discovered, as it involved the decomposition of traditional elements, such as air and water. This led to the idea there was a separate atom for each element which explained the differences between the elements. The sub atomic particles were discovered in a necessary order with the outer particles like the electron being discovered earlier, and inner particles such as quarks being discovered later. The order of discovery of particles was also affected by the properties of the particles. The charges of particles, their mass and ability to survive outside the particles they make up, and other properties will make a particle harder or easier to discover. The order of discovery is inevitable and set by the structure of the universe.

These new forms of teaching do not replace the teacher but adapt his role from omniscient to mentor and role model for students. With the use of technological means and the teacher's contribution to the teaching of the courses, the results in learning - let alone in the understanding of specialty courses- can be even more remarkable and bring about changes and perspectives for new approaches in the field of education. The aim of this survey was to investigate the use of new technologies by teachers today in the teaching of specialty courses and to what extent this implementation can improve the learning process. The results of the research show that our sample not only has a positive attitude towards the use of new forms of technology in the teaching of specialty courses but also seems to understand the benefits that arise from their use for the teachers themselves, for students, and the whole educational process.",TRUE,FALSE,Educational Technology|Learning|New Technologies|Specialty Courses|Teaching,2021-03-11T08:07:43.557101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T08:07:11.547316,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/citation/,p4dgh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60498fccb57c9c00238099e4/,60498fccb57c9c00238099e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4dgh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p4dgh/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.183,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p4dgh

Data were collected from 22 parents during focus group interviews (n=6) combined with activity-oriented questions. Based on data, four perpetrator and two victim-specific risk profiles were created. When parents find similarities between their children and perceived victims or perpetrators, it triggers the defensive othering effect, which acts as a subconscious protection mechanism, yet often creates inaccurate risk assessment and false confidence. The findings also tender that most parents do not teach their children the necessary skills related to CSA since they determine the risk to be low. This study adds to our understanding of CSA-related risk perception and prevention approaches, offering a conceptual addition to the defensive attribution theory. Further investigation is needed on the impacts of the cognitive processes and psychological protection mechanisms in relation to CSA risk assessment. The data from this study will be useful in developing CSA prevention programs and materials.",TRUE,FALSE,child sexual abuse|defensive othering|focus groups|othering|parenting|parent-led CSA education|qualitative methods|rape myths|risk perception|sex offender profiles|stereotypes|victimization,2021-03-11T13:18:22.158250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T13:17:56.115862,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/citation/,np28g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6049658cb57c9c000c807725/,6049658cb57c9c000c807725,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/np28g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/np28g/,https://doi.org/10.32603/2412-8562-2021-7-2-56-80,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/np28g

While numerous studies cast doubt on the theory of ecological modernization, existing analyses do not fully address the theory’s core hypothesis on the relationship between technological innovation and environmental impacts. I resolve this problem by using newly available global patent data on environmental technologies across 35 countries from 1982-2016. Results demonstrate that as a nation’s technology sector increases its development of environmental technologies, its per capita ecological footprint declines.

It does so by scraping the websites of 6.090 journals from 17 publishers, thereby structuring publicly available information (names, affiliations, editorial roles etc.) about 478.563 researchers. The project will iterate this webscraping procedure annually to enable insights into the changes of editorial boards over time.

A comparative study of citizen attitudes in nine young and consolidated democracies,"Technocratic cabinets and expert, non-political ministers appointed in otherwise partisan cabinets have become a common reality in recent decades in young and older democracies, but we know little about how citizens see this change and what values, perceptions and experiences drive their attitudes towards technocratic government. The article explores the latter topic by drawing on recent comparative survey data from 9 countries, both young and consolidated democracies from Europe and Latin America. Two individual-level characteristics trigger particularly strong support for the replacement of politicians with experts: low political efficacy and authoritarian values. They are complemented by a third, somewhat weaker factor: corruption perception. At macro level, technocracy appeals to citizens of countries where the quality of democracy is deficient and where technocratic cabinets are part of historical legacy.

Using data obtained through freedom of information requests to police forces and aggregated police records, this paper presents police force-level and nationwide patterns in recorded crimes, police arrests and crime outcomes for this new crime and shows that, nationally, the number of recorded crimes and arrests rose steadily, but there was significant variation in these patterns between police forces. Analysing police outcomes, we demonstrate that coercive control crimes face greater evidential challenges and are far less likely to result in prosecution than domestic abuse crimes in general. We discuss their implications of these trends and findings for the policing and criminalisation of coercive control.",TRUE,FALSE,coercive control|domestic abuse|policing,2021-03-11T13:18:42.103381,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T13:18:14.801881,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/vx789/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/citation/,jaxde,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60490782704f57008a977db7/,60490782704f57008a977db7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jaxde/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jaxde/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jaxde

My main point is that habit (or habitus) can be a central, not just supplemental or auxiliary concept in action theory and the explanation of action. To show this, I systematically analyze the way habits can be used as a resource to explain action while comparing the way habits explain action with the standard way we explain action as being caused by the interplay of beliefs, desires, and intentions. I point to the specific “historical” way that habits can be seen as causes of action and show that the conceptual commitments of habit‐based explanations are both more substantial and more robust than intention‐based explanations. Once formed, habits act as inclinations and dispositions, being reliably triggered in the requisite context by the appropriate circumstances. Finally, I analyze the core concept of automaticity as applied to habit. I argue that since automaticity is not a unitary concept, different features of automaticity are more central to habit than others, allowing us to differentiate the most representative members of the habit category from more peripheral members.",TRUE,FALSE,action|automaticity|explanation|habit|social theory,2021-03-10T17:09:23.048114,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-10T17:08:56.845809,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/citation/,7fdz8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pvujf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/relationships/node/,pvujf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6048f878642d15008dd94fb7/,6048f878642d15008dd94fb7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7fdz8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7fdz8/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jtsb.12273,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7fdz8

We consider how far recent research can provide empirical grounding for this argument. We find that there is a growing body of evidence that populist support is associated with low social status – is an expression of status rather than of class politics. The evidence that status discontents arise from the discordance between meritocratic discourse and the failure to realise a meritocracy is less  strong but, such as it is, appears consistent with the claims that the authors in question make.   We suggest that further research in this latter regard would be of more than academic importance, given the policy and political implications that would follow if a meritocracy-populism connection were to be more decisively confirmed.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-13T04:00:03.604197,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-10T16:31:02.126527,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/citation/,qgrkf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6048ecde704f57007c976f07/,6048ecde704f57007c976f07,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrkf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgrkf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgrkf
