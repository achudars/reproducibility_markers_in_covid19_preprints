One of the largest areas within society influenced by the progress of technology are the fields of finances, economy, and investment, coupled with the aspect of social influence. With this shift in society parallel to the advancement of contemporary technologies, thus becoming increasingly reliant on the tools made available, the complex yet traditional world of finance has pivoted, becoming contingent upon the use of cutting-edge technologies. This critical shift has introduced the world of Fintech, providing many innovative fiscal opportunities. The coined term, Fintech, is a general term referring to products as services for fiscal activities developed by entities unrelated to banks, insurance firms, nor online companies, providing alternatives to the traditional options available to the general public. (Gulamhuseinwala, Bull and Lewis, 2015). Resultantly of this Fintech trend, one of the largest and most promising fields of contemporary investment is recognized as that of Cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most recognized and heavily traded currencies.
 Many positive traits can be used to define the novelty of this new economy, with one of the main aspects being its peer to peer (P2P) nature of its trading process. However, beyond the tremendous advancements visible within the process of Cryptocurrency production and trade, one of the most important aspects is the influencers upon the valuation of the different currencies. Similarly to the progression of the economy which has transported the financial world to a digital economy, so has the social world, advancing discourse regarding many topics to the online environment. Thus, it is critical to analyze and assess the nature of online discourse regarding Cryptocurrencies. Explicitly, the chatter preceding to sharp rises and falls with Bitcoin and Ethereum, the most recognizable coins. Additionally, it is imperative to appraise the trends in the behavior and quantity of online discourse prior to a significant drop in Ethereum &amp; Bitcoin.
Within the online arena, there are countless different outlets and platforms for people to express themselves in general, or more importantly in this instance regarding the topic of Cryptocurrencies. By using platforms that are designated for discussion regarding financial topics or general social media platforms, the public is provided a critical platform utilized by countless individuals, many of whom are increasingly involved with the aforementioned topics. These platforms stipulate a stage for these individuals, who have become critical by voicing their opinions, thoughts, and experiences. Many of these influencers are sought after for their knowledge, specifically influencing the behavior of others. However, it is critical to evaluate the importance of additional aspects beyond the superficial such as who are the influencers, rather elements such as the content or nature of what is being discussed.

Bradbury. The article aims to determine the means of the verbal representation of “man-machinery” and build frame models of its components in Bradbury’s science fiction writings. The study contributes to the stylistic and linguo-poetic analysis of binary oppositions in fiction texts, idiostylistics and genre theory. The study relies upon linguistic, stylistic, and discursive analyses as well as cognitive linguistic analysis to ensure the reliability and validity of the obtained results. Furthermore, four-stage algorithm methodology used in this research allowed the author to define a general literary context of the analyzed works, select the research material, analyze the identified means of binary opposition “man-machinery,” and model frames of its components. The obtained results reveal that the linguistic embodiment of the components of the binary opposition “man-machinery” is based on the use of the lexical – direct and figurative, stylistic, and discursive means of nomination. The study reconstructs the concepts – the constituents of the megaconcepts man and machinery and on the basis of anthropocentric perception compares their conceptual domains, namely as physical, psychological, mental, and social phenomena. The research reveals conceptual binary opposition man-machinery as a tool for constructing a science fiction model of the world in Bradbury’s texts within three parameters: space-time coordinates, cause and effect relationships, and valorative indicators.

The successful development of a person ready for “survival” is a process of entering into a foreign culture. The most objective solving of the problem of students’ acquaintance with a foreign culture, as the authors believe, is modeling real intercultural intercourse situations: that is, intentional confrontation of situations of native and foreign cultures. The creation of the model of foreign culture is one of the basic requirements of foreign language teaching as a means of “survival.” It requires working out new components of teaching-methodical complexes, both in content and form. Students’ preparation for acquisition of foreign culture is one of the unique objectives of contemporary higher education. Motivation is one of the main factors on which students' proficiency depends. Students’ interest in learning foreign languages can be arisen by some new methods of teaching. Humor application during English classes at universities is essential because studying peculiarities of English and American humor the learners of foreign languages are ready to enter the system of international and world cultures and behave naturally either in British or American societies. English humor is an integral part of British and American society, so its knowledge is necessary for learners of English as a second language. Humor usually requires a specific style and is based on surprise. It means that something relevant to the audience is present and goes something different from what the audience expected. Our pedagogical experiment with the application of humorous texts during English classes resulted in increasing students’ motivation, broadening their mental outlook, and knowledge of a foreign culture.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-26T01:27:20.849682,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-26T01:27:06.150511,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/citation/,4y5ud,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdd6fdab65180111b0e67f/,5fbdd6fdab65180111b0e67f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y5ud/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4y5ud/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4y5ud,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.25

Particular attention is paid to the definitions of borrowing as a lexicological phenomenon offered on account of various scholars and based on several lexicographic resources. The article also focuses on numerous French borrowings in contemporary English, their grammatical and structural nature. The suggested classification of the distinguished linguistic units is given after a Spanish linguist Capuz. The article includes the general outline on the subject of borrowings, various aspects of loan classifications. The core part of the research was the typology of linguistic borrowings, like formal, morphological, semantic, lexical, syntactic, phraseological, and pragmatic borrowings. The authors analyzed the most important periods in history, like Old English, Middle English, and Modern English. All periods can be characterized through means of typical for them words. In the course of analysis, the following types of French borrowings have been established: formal, morphological, semantic, lexical, syntactic, and phraseological. The English vocabulary stock was compiled from different semantic fields and historical periods, starting from the Old up to Present Day English.",TRUE,FALSE,borrowing|classification|French|historical periods|the English language,2020-11-30T05:33:40.990090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:33:27.874478,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/citation/,mnw35,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdd5a9ab6518011fb10d85/,5fbdd5a9ab6518011fb10d85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mnw35/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mnw35/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mnw35,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.24

The law lies in the fact that the methods used in teaching foreign languages should be considered from their most significant effect to achieve educational goals. The research work aims at analyzing the technological support of the process of teaching foreign languages for specific purposes. We consider this support as an essential component of professional training. While working on the paper, we used the following methods of pedagogical research: theoretical analysis and generalization of literature on the research problem; theoretical forecasting methods; a sociological survey (questionnaire, interviews) of students and teachers; testing; mathematical processing of the results of questionnaires and interviews. We developed and used several cases for students of different specialties in our teaching practice. Our development of cases and our teaching experience in the research field proved the effect of the use of the case-study method and its main advantages. We highlight the main question for further developments in the research field as the problems for developing and solving for the effective implementation of this method in teaching practices.",TRUE,FALSE,case-study method|communicative competence|languages for specific purposes|Ukrainian students,2020-11-30T05:34:00.799312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:33:43.114230,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/citation/,ntfym,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbdd4e7ab6518011fb10b1e/,5fbdd4e7ab6518011fb10b1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntfym/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ntfym/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ntfym,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt3.23
