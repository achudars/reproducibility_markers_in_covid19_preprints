Less attention has been paid to what people actually consider “diverse”. Social psychologists have studied how evaluations of racial and ethnic diversity vary systematically across individuals of different racial identities, but they have not theorized the role of socially shared reference points in shaping these judgments, or how evaluations may vary across other salient dimensions, such as political party affiliation. Using a survey experiment (N= 2009), I examine how ratings of diversity for white-majority neighborhoods and white-minority neighborhoods vary by respondents’ political party affiliations and how the presence of commonly shared demographic reference points shapes these judgments. When evaluating white-majority populations, Democrats, Independents, and Republicans draw different qualitative interpretations from the same quantitative data, but this evaluative disagreement is ameliorated when people are anchored with shared reference points. This research contributes to our understandings of how people interpret and evaluate racial diversity, and to how people make meaning from numbers in the absence of strongly institutionalized commensuration.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|diversity|evaluation,2020-12-18T21:29:23.352683,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-18T21:28:37.122440,FALSE,NA,no,Available upon request,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/citation/,b235s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdc35a2f0df54052b2f3d7b/,5fdc35a2f0df54052b2f3d7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b235s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b235s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b235s,NA

We study how a core strategy of international civil society groups - informing and publicizing human rights abuses - impacts those tied to abuse. Our study focuses on a major trend at the center of on-going international media campaigns: the assassination of civil society activists involved in mining activity. Collecting and coding 20 years of data on assassination events, we use Event Study Methodology to study how publicity of these events impact the asset prices of firms associated with abuse. We show that publicizing abuses has a significant impact on multinationals. Firms associated with an assassination have large, negative abnormal returns following the event. We calculate a median loss in market capitalisation of over 100 million USD, ten days following violence. We highlight the role of media publicity in our results. We show negative returns from assassinations are stronger during periods of low media pressure, versus when they coincide with competing newsworthy events. As well, we argue our results are driven by events where companies are explicitly named in media publicity, using a set of placebo events where no firms were identified by news coverage. Furthermore, we reject that our results are driven by other forms of unrest and conflict.

However, we know little about how rankings direct media attention, as well as how media in turn shape and help sustain careers of specific rankings in the public over longer periods of time. To advance our understanding of the discursive dynamics at the intersection of rankings and the press, this study examines the media career of the Global Slavery Index (GSI) by analyzing 361 newspaper and magazine articles, published between the release of index’s inaugural edition in 2013 and until the end of 2019. To interpret the media coverage, the study draws attention to GSI’s universality, highly rationalized character, and a pledge to spotlight violation of the global moral order. The examination of the media coverage points to the following properties of the index as having shaped and helped sustain its career in the public: (1) repeated publication; (2) broad definition of modern slavery; and (3) the construction thereof as a measurable global burden. The study finds that, throughout the period, the media were remarkably consistent in amplifying the most dramatic elements of the index. Over time, however, the index was increasingly more invoked for other purposes, usually either to lend credibility to a story or as a way of embedding local and situational concerns into global narratives.",TRUE,FALSE,Global Slavery Index|Media|Rankings|Transnational Governance|Virtue,2020-12-18T21:28:02.216187,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-18T21:27:33.968902,FALSE,NA,no,"320 out of 361 media articles analyzed were retrieved through: https://www.english-corpora.org/now/ (search ""Global Slavery Index""; endpoint: end of 2019).

While one of the more ‘privileged’ workers who did not lose her job during the crisis, Prachi had to suddenly and swiftly adapt to the practice of ‘work-from-home’. As a neophyte service worker with very limited infrastructure for working at home, Prachi experienced deterioration in her physical and mental health. While working long hours to keep her family afloat during this difficult time, she also had to negotiate the compulsion to participate in housework. Her employers’ distrust and increased surveillance has left her feeling vulnerable, particularly as a woman whose work is not given due recognition in the organisation.

Metascientific activists have advocated policies that incentivize replications and make them more diagnostically potent. We argue that current debates, as well as research in the science and technology studies, have paid little heed to a key dimension of replication practice. Although it sometimes serves a diagnostic function, replication is commonly motivated by a practical desire to extend research interests. The resulting replication, which we label ‘integrative’, is characterized by a pragmatic flexibility toward protocols. The goal is to appropriate what is useful, not test for truth. Within many experimental cultures, however, integrative replications can produce replications of ambiguous diagnostic power. Based on interviews with 60 members of the Board of Reviewing Editors for the journal Science, we show how the interplay between the diagnostic and integrative motives for replication differs between fields and produces different cultures of replication.

A long-term historical view (Barcelona area, 16th-19th centuries)","Parental influence over children’s status attainment has historically been argued to be key. However, the cross-sibling influence has been scarcely studied for historical periods and for steam family societies, being the most long-lasting relationship across individuals’ lives once childhood was surpassed. We investigate how intra-generational family relationships determine the social destiny of siblings taking a long-term perspective (16th and the 19th centuries) for Barcelona and its hinterland, using the unique data compiled in the Barcelona Historical Marriage Database. This region was one of the most dynamic economic area in Southern Europe. We found the emergence of the figure of first-married siblings as determinants in the status attainment of other brothers and sisters and a decline in parental influence from the 18th century onwards for all social groups, denying a sibling competing model. This influence worked differently over time depending on sex. First-born sisters with exogamous marriages had a higher influence than first-married brothers on the social mobility of the rest of siblings along the 16th and 17th century. Conversely, from the 18th century onwards, first-married brothers had a higher ascendancy than first-married sisters. Sibship size and the siblings’ marriage order did not contribute to explain these effects. These results can be interpreted in light of an increase in life expectancy of adult population and a change in the occupational structure due to an early industrialization and in affectivity in the18th century.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperative breeding|cross-sibling influence|family relationships|intra-generational|sibling competition|social mobility|status attainment,2020-12-16T18:53:21.104525,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-16T16:53:29.082426,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,"""Five Centuries of Marriages”  (FP7-ERC-2010-AdG-269796).",2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/citation/,sf6vj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fda064af0df54041c2f0bf1/,5fda064af0df54041c2f0bf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sf6vj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sf6vj,NA
