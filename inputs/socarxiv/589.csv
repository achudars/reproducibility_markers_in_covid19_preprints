Para isto, será estudado de que modo os deslocamentos populacionais inter-regionais e intra-metropolitanos, em direção àquela cidade, estão afetando a configuração sócio-espacial da região metropolitana. Nesse sentido, avaliando as razões da mobilidade espacial, estar-se-á analisando a influência do espaço urbano e de fatores econômicos e políticos sobre o fluxo populacional, além de compreender de que forma esse fluxo está afetando o espaço metropolitano. Salienta-se ainda a importância de se realizar um estudo que possa ao menos levantar algumas contribuições para a elaboração de uma proposta de reordenação do espaço urbano, no sentido de democratizar seu uso. Esse estudo de planejamento urbano e regional poderia ser uma maneira de reforçar a discussão sobre o assunto, suscitando novos e mais amplos trabalhos sobre essa região metropolitana.

Drawing on pioneering theories of political violence, social psychological research on intergroup attitudes and behavior, and prospect theory, we examine individual-level mechanisms relating inequality to political violence. Our theoretical analysis generates two propositions that diverge from extant civil conflict research. Despite being the key explanatory mechanism, perceived lower economic status vis-à-vis other individuals (relative deprivation) is unlikely to motivate people to participate in political violence. By contrast, although virtually unexplored, a projected decrease in one’s own economic status (prospective decremental deprivation) is likely to motivate participation in political violence. Multilevel analyses of nationally representative samples from a large number of countries provide strong evidence to support these claims. Based on this, we posit that focusing on economic changes, rather than the economic status quo, is key to understanding political violence. We conclude by discussing how focusing on temporal changes, as contrasted to static characteristics, can advance the study of civil conflict writ large.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil conflict|Civil war|Decremental deprivation|Inequality|Political violence|Relative deprivation,2018-07-02T13:33:11.489520,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-25T10:51:50.664092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/citation/,mcjyp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qh4k5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/relationships/node/,qh4k5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b06e4a1c704aa0012d19622/,5b06e4a1c704aa0012d19622,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mcjyp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mcjyp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mcjyp

Evaluating Student Outcomes of a Fall-Semester Transition Program at a Public Flagship University,"Does the structure of the first-year college experience affect students’ graduation outcomes? I investigate this question by evaluating UC Berkeley’s Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), a fall-semester program for undergraduates admitted for the following spring semester. During the fall semester, FPF participants take introductory courses and receive advising at a separate campus blocks away from UC Berkeley, while living and socializing with regular UC Berkeley students; in the spring semester, FPF participants then matriculate to the main campus. I analyze UC Berkeley admissions and registrar data and show that FPF participants are similar to fall-semester matriculants in their admission characteristics and predicted graduation rates. However, across a variety of treatment effect models, I estimate that FPF participants have a 3–4 percentage-point increase in their four- and six-year graduation rates compared to fall-semester matriculants. FPF participants with below-median high school GPAs and SAT scores have larger increases in their likelihood to graduate. Estimates adjusted for unobservable selection bias (Oster, 2017) are similar in magnitude and direction to my main estimates.",TRUE,FALSE,college completion|college transition|graduation|spring admission,2018-07-02T13:33:10.011029,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-24T15:10:52.365410,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/citation/,8vwhd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vsgnz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/relationships/node/,vsgnz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b063f9dadd54d00124e1e0a/,5b063f9dadd54d00124e1e0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vwhd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8vwhd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8vwhd

But, few empirical studies have looked closely at how institutions become relatively distinct cultural and structural domains. This paper examines how institutional entrepreneurs—in this case, Major League Baseball (MLB) sportswriters—build and sustain institutional boundaries by considering how they create a distinct cultural discourse that infuses baseball places, times, and events with culturally distinct meanings. Drawing from sportswriters’ columns, documentaries, and monographs written on baseball, we show that MLB entrepreneurs have developed and disseminated a discourse oriented around the generalized medium of sport exchange, interaction, and communication: competitiveness. Using these data, the paper below examines how this medium becomes quantified and embodied in tangible and intangible forms. Additionally, the paper draws on sports columns that illustrate how MLB entrepreneurs protect the autonomy of a sacred core (the Hall of Fame) from internal threats (gambling and performance-enhancement drugs) and external corruption (the influence of money). The paper ends with a discussion of implications for the applicability of the findings to other sports and institutional domains.",TRUE,FALSE,baseball|cultural sociology|institutions|moral entrepreneurship|sport,2018-07-02T11:53:27.942402,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T20:33:36.727917,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/citation/,peqjk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eqr5k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/relationships/node/,eqr5k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0474cfc4deab001193d379/,5b0474cfc4deab001193d379,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/peqjk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/peqjk

Conventional measures of segregation have been criticised for ignoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of everyday life, which are theorized to influence the ease of interaction between people. In this paper we explore a Social Interaction Potential based measure of racial segregation (SIP-Seg). SIP-Seg attempts to quantify the time-geographic constraints on between-group and within-group interaction opportunities based on the spatial distributions of residences, workplaces, and the daily commute. We compute SIP-Seg for all Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States, and regress them against conventional measures of segregation as well as a host of factors capturing the spatial structure of regions. Our results indicate that the relationship between zonal segregation and SIP-Seg is strong, but the strongest explanatory factors are race-disaggregated commuting distances, which explain far more of the variance than non-racial spatial structure factors.

After 1500, with the descending of the European traders on its shores, the cotton textile industry boomed. It accounted for nearly two-fifths of all textile exports to Europe from Asia. I attempt, in this essay, to understand the ‘Global Divergence’ debate in South Asia with a focus on Bengal and its trade and production in cotton textiles. I situate Bengal as a central region of cotton production and trade in the early modern global economy with regards to not only Europe but also to other parts of Asia and within the sub-continent itself. I reiterate Prasannan Parthasarathi’s contribution to the ‘Great Divergence’ debate to argue that Bengal hosted a thriving cotton textile industry deep into the late eighteenth century. I echo that the destruction of the textile industry occurred in the high days of colonialism in the latter half of the nineteenth century. I attempt to substantiate this by trying to understand Om Prakash’s analysis of the methods of procurement of production before and after the ascendency of the Europeans as political administratorsin Bengal; when production by weavers was market driven and when it was driven by coercion and impunity, respectively.  I finally conclude by commenting on the limitation of this analysis and the further research scope it holds.",TRUE,FALSE,Bengal|Britain|Cotton|Dutch East India Company|Early Modern|English East India Company|Europe|Global Economy|Great Divergence|India|Indian Ocean|South Asia|Weavers,2018-07-02T11:53:27.406684,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T18:34:30.695802,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce5|Arts and Humanities|History|Other History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/citation/,axvh3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/umvzy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/relationships/node/,umvzy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b043a2aa556d0001208bf90/,5b043a2aa556d0001208bf90,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axvh3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/axvh3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/axvh3

In its post-War setting, it aimed to promote the new Man by crossing the anxious binaries of Cold War politics. In reality, however, it fed on these very anxieties with the USA and USSR using art, technology, architectural designs to further the propaganda of their respective competing antagonistic political worldview. But, some small countries like the Soviet satellite states of Czechoslovakia and Hungary made a significant impact through their pavilions on the millions of visitors. The death of Stalin in 1953 followed by the comparatively liberal policies of Khrushchev and the consequent political disturbances in Hungary and, political reforms in Czechoslovakia determined the content and styling of the pavilions at the Expo. Both the countries marked a shift from socialist realism and posited themselves through art, architecture or technological displays which were more abstract, innovative, individualistic, existential, humanistic and even avant-garde. Moreover, the local, regional, ethnic and even the national were strongly emphasized in the pavilions, some of which at times were bereft of the traditional symbolism of a socialist state. The emphasis on the national illustrated the contradictions in the ideology and action of politics in these east and central European countries in the light of the post-Stalinist era. These contradictions, not only helped to realign the dominance of socialism internally, but had global implications and intentions in the cultural Cold War, which were played out through the content and styling of the pavilions at the expo in Brussels.",TRUE,FALSE,Cold War|Communism|Cultural Politics|EXPO|Modernity|National|Nationalism|Socialism|USA|USSR,2018-07-02T11:53:27.365964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T18:33:56.022601,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cda|Arts and Humanities|History|Public History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce3|Arts and Humanities|History|European History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/citation/,mgvx6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b59qg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/relationships/node/,b59qg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0438fee9cb340012b39a81/,5b0438fee9cb340012b39a81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mgvx6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mgvx6
