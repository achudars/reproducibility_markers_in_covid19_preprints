Data were collected using questionnaires which were distributed to 200 students at Yarmouk University. The questionnaire consists of two parts: the first part contains demographic information about the participants and the second part includes two sections: the students’ preferences and the students’ reading difficulties. The findings reveal that the respondents are motivated to learn as they are in dire need for acquiring English. However, they face several problems in the reading process, such as ambiguous words, unfamiliar vocabulary, and limited available time to cognitively process the text. The findings of this study may be useful to policy makers in Jordan to improve the leaners’ reading experience.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL reading|higher education institution|Jordanian students|reading comprehension|reading difficulties,2018-07-02T11:15:54.510634,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T02:33:37.986746,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/citation/,rfp4s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yphc8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/relationships/node/,yphc8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e419e26c613b02c3cf43bb/,59e419e26c613b02c3cf43bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfp4s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rfp4s/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.27,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rfp4s

Whilst ideologically young Malaysians can pick and choose where they want to learn, these schools are clustered around ethnicity, language and even religion. Only the majority national schools (or sekolah kebangsaan) reflect the diversity of the ideological Malaysian ‘race’ (or bangsa Malaysia). For national type schools (or sekolah jenis kebangsaan), these are almost exclusively subscribed by Tamil speaking students who are mostly Indians or by Mandarin speaking students who are mostly Chinese. The focus of this empirical paper is on a final school type, national religious schools (or sekolah kebangsaan agama), that represents the religious ideology of the Malaysian majority race, the Malay-Muslims. These are primary and secondary ‘Islamic schools’ that place heavy emphasis on Islamic education often through the medium of Arabic, for the Malay-Muslim majority in Malaysia. This paper focuses on the lived experiences of 30 first year university undergraduates who completed five to six years of secondary education in national religious schools. Data were collected from periodic focus group discussions and also written narrative ‘reflections’ of their Islamic school days with three cohorts of selected undergraduates from March 2016 to May 2017 at two university campuses in northern Malaysia.

For this purpose, over than 300 of English words borrowed by MSA are analyzed. At the syllabic and prosodic level, mechanisms like cluster simplification, syllabic consonant conversion, gemination, etc. are found at work and by far systematic in MSA borrowings.

Thus, the main research question focuses on the perceived English language needs of the learners at Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB), and the study involves an investigation into the mismatch between the Cutting Edge course book and the needs of PSAB students. A total of 70 students from different technical sections at Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB), Saudi Arabia participated in the study. Two types of data collection methods were used in this study: quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (interviews). The results obtained reveal that the current course book being used at PSAB does not meet their needs because the activities provided are not relevant to the specific context of their field, which is mainly military and aviation. Finding and adapting a textbook that is clearly linked to these students’ needs and to the course objectives is suggested as one possible solution. In the context of PSAB, data from the interviews and surveys shows the need to assess the content of the course book in relation to the needs of the learners. It also indicates the strong demand of the students for supplementary materials that provide linguistic input to match their needs.

This quasi-experimental study was conducted in Unaizah Community College, Saudi Arabia. Both the experimental group and the control group were tested on 2000-word vocabulary test. A vocabulary test was prepared and administered by the researchers at the beginning of the experiment as a pre-test. The experimental group was taught with Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD) strategy whereas the control group was taught with traditional whole-class instruction method. The treatment was carried out for two weeks. At the end of the experiment, the same vocabulary test was re-administered as a post-test.

The present paper addresses a major feature of gender depiction in the Moroccan English as a Foreign Language (EFL) textbooks officially approved by the Ministry of Education and compulsory for high school students. Adopting a feminist theoretical approach, the study has quantitatively and qualitatively processed the gendered dialogues along with the related illustrations embedded in four EFL Moroccan textbooks, in addition to the gender roles assumed throughout different contexts (occupational/family roles, interests, activities). The textbooks were selected on the basis of their common themes and the different publication dates, starting from 1990 to 2005. The main aim is to see whether the English textbook designers adopt a gender-based approach as a preliminary initiative for pedagogical innovation, or they implicitly and explicitly use them to disseminate discriminatory discourses. The study reveals that women’s positive representation is persistently deteriorated in the Moroccan EFL textbooks. This stands against all steps towards pedagogical innovation and reinforces the traditional gender ideology. It suggests the urgent need for more pedagogical improvement at the level of gender representation in the Moroccan EFL textbooks. More importantly, is the need for all teacher training centres to prepare new teacher generations ready to use sexist texts constructively. The results’ implication is instrumental to the learning materials’ revision. It is also useful for all English language practitioners, textbook designers, and pedagogical experts addressing the challenge of adopting a gender-based approach as a way to open all avenues for pedagogical innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,curriculum|deterioration|gender discriminatory discourses|Moroccan EFL textbooks|pedagogical innovation,2018-07-02T11:15:54.281532,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T02:05:21.918969,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/citation/,9n74b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mkrgv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/relationships/node/,mkrgv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e41351594d9002b1c6b705/,59e41351594d9002b1c6b705,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9n74b/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9n74b

Today, films are no longer thought of as simple entertainment media but rather educational tools as well. Globalization has contributed greatly to the availability of English-language films and that enriches the source of English learning material dramatically. This research paper explores the effect of using English films in English as foreign language (EFL) classroom. It reveals the effect on developing students’ motivation, comprehension as well as communication skills. The study was carried out on a sample of two groups: an experimental group using films alongside their course book and a control group taught in a conventional way. The participants were classified as pre-intermediate level. The findings of this study have shown that those in the experimental group significantly outperformed their control group counterpart in terms of motivation and language production. Also, this study offers pedagogical implications for EFL teachers to use films in their classrooms to enhance students’ listening and speaking skills which as a result improved students’ learning.",TRUE,FALSE,communication skills|EFL learners|films|motivation,2018-07-02T11:15:54.130976,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T01:55:33.059363,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/citation/,h34ax,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hd6cm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/relationships/node/,hd6cm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e4110b9ad5a102b489d793/,59e4110b9ad5a102b489d793,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h34ax/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h34ax/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h34ax

This is a survey for non-native English speaking teachers (NNESTs) of Indonesian Senior High Schools ( or in Indonesian terms ‘SMA’) from different L2 environments, namely: 1) urban-region exposure environment schools (n=40), and 2) rural-region exposure environment schools (n=40). There were two instruments used in the present study, i.e. 1) observation scaling checklist, and 2) questionnaire. The observation scaling checklist was used for assessing the respondents’ performance when they were teaching in class. Meanwhile, the questionnaire using a four-point Likert scale was used to elicit data. The researchers used a series of independent t-test to analyze the data. The result reveals that: 1) there is a significant difference between teaching skills of NNESTs from the urban region schools and those of NNESTs from rural region schools, t (78)= 19.499, p=0.000; and 2) there is a significant difference between beliefs about English as a foreign language (EFL learning beyond  the classroom of the NNESTs from urban region schools and those of NNESTs from rural region schools, t (78)= - 4.925, p=0.000",TRUE,FALSE,and teaching skills|Beliefs about EFL learning beyond the classroom|L2 exposure environment|NNEST,2018-07-02T11:15:54.084650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T01:52:09.254535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/citation/,wj4kg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s6m7t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/relationships/node/,s6m7t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e40f9c594d9002b1c6b567/,59e40f9c594d9002b1c6b567,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wj4kg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wj4kg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.18,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wj4kg
