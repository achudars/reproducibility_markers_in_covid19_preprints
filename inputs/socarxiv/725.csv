Bestriţa and up

conductivity, pH, total acidity, nitrates, chlorine. The values obtained
were cartographically represented to highlight differences between the
sector that cross of the rural area and the sector located in the urban
area. Water Management System Neamţ realizes assessments of the ecological

water quality in relation to general indicators. Thus, data obtained over a
