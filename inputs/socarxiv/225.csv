While social scientists know a fair amount about the extent to which people complied with these recommendations, far less is known about why some people may have been more likely to do so. Building on insights from Human Values Theory, we argue that people who are more self-transcendent (i.e., more likely to put others’ needs before their own) should be more likely to engage in a variety of prosocial health behaviors (PSHB); including social distancing. In a nationally representative survey (N = 1,015) conducted at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, we find that people who are highly self-transcendent were significantly more likely to engage in PSHB. Recognizing the limitations of self-reported data, we validate these findings by merging both international and inter-state phone-tracking data into state and country opinion surveys. We find that, on average, people in both countries and states that place a higher emphasis on self-transcendence values were more likely to engage in social distancing at the start of the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID19|Health Behavior|Mask Wearing|Political Psychology|Political Science|Public Opinion|Social Distancing|Values,2020-07-17T14:12:27.528531,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-17T14:12:13.212556,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/j3rud/,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,Matt Motta &amp; Paul Goren,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/citation/,hxjk5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j3rud/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/relationships/node/,j3rud,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f108b54a5e5ea009843a925/,5f108b54a5e5ea009843a925,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjk5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hxjk5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hxjk5

In austere times, resources are scarce and welfare recalibration involves multidimensional trade-offs. Existing research primarily studied preferences towards individual policies or trade-offs in specific policy fields, failing to capture citizens’ overall social policy priorities. Using two novel survey experiments in three European countries, we show that citizens have clear priorities: pensions and education enjoy a high, family policies a medium, and labor market policies a low priority. However, policy constituencies have different relative priorities.

Evidence from Survey Experiments on Budgetary Priorities,"Ever since the Great Recession, the issue of public debt has become more salient and politicized. Existing research claims that citizens are fiscally conservative and oppose debt. However, we do not know whether and how much citizens care about government debt, given that reducing it, often under the guise of austerity, involves substantial spending and tax trade-offs. We account for these budgetary trade-offs by using a split-sample and conjoint survey experiment in four European countries. The results show that fiscal consolidation is not a priority for citizens. When forced to choose, support for lower debt at the cost of lower spending or higher taxes is smaller than in an unconstrained setting. Revenue-based consolidations are especially unpopular, but expenditure-based consolidations are also contested. Moreover, the public has clear fiscal policy priorities: People do not favor lower debt and taxes, but they support more progressive taxes to pay for higher government spending.",TRUE,FALSE,austerity|conjoint surveys|fiscal policy|government debt|public opinion|survey experiments,2020-07-16T15:12:42.043095,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-16T15:09:29.045864,FALSE,NA,no,The data will be made available after the review process.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/citation/,gw5ea,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f10675b12c7af0086c0575f/,5f10675b12c7af0086c0575f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gw5ea/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gw5ea/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gw5ea

Results show that most ethnic minority groups are more likely to have university aspirations than ethnic majority youth. The most consistent minority advantage is found in England and Sweden, consistent with the interpretation that the ample scope for choice in progression through these school systems allows high ambitions of minorities to play out well. However, minority advantage of some groups is also present in the Netherlands and Germany, where transitions are more heavily conditional on previous performance.

The base postulate of quantum mechanics formulated by Niels Bohr that it studies the system of an investigated microscopic quantum entity and the macroscopic apparatus described by the smooth equations of classical mechanics by the readings of the latter implies as a necessary condition of quantum mechanics the absence of hidden variables, and thus, quantum indeterminism. Consequently, the objectivity of quantum mechanics and even its possibility and ability to study its objects as they are by themselves imply quantum indeterminism. The so-called free-will theorems in quantum mechanics elucidate that the “valuable commodity” of free will is not a privilege of the experimenters and human beings, but it is shared by anything in the physical universe once the experimenter is granted to possess free will. The analogical idea, that e.g. an electron might possess free will to “decide” what to do, scandalized Einstein forced him to exclaim (in a letter to Max Born in 2016) that he would be а shoemaker or croupier rather than a physicist if this was true. Anyway, many experiments confirmed the absence of hidden variables and thus quantum indeterminism in virtue of the objectivity and completeness of quantum mechanics. Once quantum mechanics is complete and thus an objective science, one can ask what this would mean in relation to classical physics and its objectivity. In fact, it divides disjunctively what possesses free will from what does not. Properly, all physical objects belong to the latter area according to it, and their “behavior” is necessary and deterministic. All possible decisions, on the contrary, are concentrated in the experimenters (or human beings at all), i.e. in the former domain not intersecting the latter. One may say that the cost of the determinism and unambiguous laws of classical physics, is the indeterminism and free will of the experimenters and researchers (human beings) therefore necessarily being out of the scope and objectivity of classical physics. This is meant as the “deterministic subjectivity of classical physics” opposed to the “indeterminist objectivity of quantum mechanics”.",TRUE,FALSE,|choice|determinism and indeterminism|free will|free will theorems|Kochen-Specker theorem,2020-07-16T08:42:20.757156,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-16T08:42:01.377590,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/citation/,97kta,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f10113112c7af0070c054b0/,5f10113112c7af0070c054b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97kta/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/97kta/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/97kta

Testing the Privacy Calculus in a Preregistered One-Week Field Experiment,"According to privacy calculus, both privacy concerns and expected gratifications explain self-disclosure online. So far, most findings were based on self-reports or short-term experiments, and it is still largely unknown how popularity cues such as like and dislike buttons affect privacy calculus. To answer these questions we ran a preregistered one-week field experiment. Participants were randomly distributed to three different websites, on which they discussed a current political topic. The websites featured either (a) like buttons, (b) like and dislike buttons, or (c) no like or dislike buttons, and were otherwise identical. The final sample consisted of 590 participants. Although the originally preregistered model was rejected, the results showed that a considerable share of actual self-disclosure could be explained by privacy concerns, gratifications, privacy deliberation, trust, and self-efficacy. The impact of the popularity cues on self-disclosure and privacy calculus was negligible.",TRUE,FALSE,field experiment|popularity cues|preregistration|privacy calculus|self-disclosure|structural equation modeling,2020-07-15T19:16:31.089197,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-15T19:16:13.546461,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/tdienlin/privacy_calc_exp/blob/master/data/data.csv,available,NA,https://osf.io/a6tzc,prereg_designs,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/citation/,7kjf2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f78nv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/relationships/node/,f78nv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0f2e76a5e5ea000c43aefa/,5f0f2e76a5e5ea000c43aefa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kjf2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7kjf2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7kjf2

The fundamental and definitive property of the totality suggests for “the totality to be all”, thus, its externality (unlike any other entity) is contained within it. This generates a fundamental (or philosophical) “doubling” of anything being referred to the totality, i.e. considered philosophically. Thus, that doubling as well as transcendentalism underlying it can be interpreted formally as an elementary choice such as a bit of information and a quantity corresponding to the number of elementary choices to be defined. This is the quantity of information defined both transcendentally and formally and thus, philosophically and mathematically. If one defines information specifically, as an elementary choice between finiteness (or mathematically, as any natural number of Peano arithmetic) and infinity (i.e. an actually infinite set in the meaning of set theory), the quantity of quantum information is defined. One can demonstrate that the so-defined quantum information and quantum information standardly defined by quantum mechanics are equivalent to each other. The equivalence of the axiom of choice and the well-ordering “theorem” is involved. It can be justified transcendentally as well, in virtue of transcendental equivalence implied by the totality. Thus, all can be considered as temporal as far anything possesses such a temporal counterpart necessarily. Formally defined, the frontier of time is the current choice now, a bit of information, furthermore interpretable as a qubit of quantum information.",TRUE,FALSE,|axiom of choice|formal transcendentalism|information|quantum information|the totality|time,2020-07-15T19:17:06.554164,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-15T19:16:34.927377,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfa|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Logic and Foundations of Mathematics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cff|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Continental Philosophy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/citation/,m8s9h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0eb47be85f460095917d2e/,5f0eb47be85f460095917d2e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m8s9h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m8s9h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m8s9h
