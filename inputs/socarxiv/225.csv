It has a long history and rich and colorful folk-custom characteristics, such as the family reunion, eating dumplings, setting off firecrackers, pasting the spring couplets, etc. Those characteristics are the reflections of traditional Chinese thinking ways and the thoughts of Confucianism. For Passover, it is like the twin-brother of the Spring Festival. During Passover, the Jewish people gather and commemorate the grace of God and the hardship of the ancestors. Passover opens a door for the further study on the thoughts and culture of the ancient Israelites, and their view on God. Their folk customs including family reunion, brushing the lamb blood on the door frame, eating  unleavened bread and bitter herbs, and some other folk events that are similar to those of the Spring Festival. From the paper, we can get a hypothesis that the beast Xi(夕) is Set with Chinese characteristic. By the way, from the paper, we can get a hypothesis that God in Judaism and Shangdi(上帝) and Tian(天) are nearly the same. Besides, we can also get a hypothesis that the Christian notion of a divine right of kings resembles the Mandate of Heaven(天命). By the way, from the paper, we can get a conclusion that Qi(弃) is actually Hemaka. Besides, from the paper, we can say that the origin of the doctrine of the mean may be the scales of justice emblem of the tribe of Dan. Furthermore, most of Q-M242 people in East Asia belong to subclade Q-M120, which distributes most intensively across northern China. The average frequency of Q-M242 in northern China is around 4.5%. However, it decreases to about 2% in southern China. According to the dynastic race theory, the Haplogroup of the elite of the ancient Egypt(especially pharaohs) may be Q. By the way, the highest frequency of Q1b1 in Europe is found among Ashkenazi Jews (5%) and Sephardic Jews (2%), suggesting that Q1b was present in the Levant before the Jewish disapora 2,000 years ago. In fact, Jewish Q1b all belong to the Y2200 subclade, which was formed some 2,600 years ago.

In doing do, they demystify norms and rules about education and attempt to position their loved ones on a path of upward mobility.

Isolation and contact tracing to identify all infected people are key public health interventions necessary to control infectious disease outbreaks. However, these activities are dependent upon the surveillance platform to identify infections quickly. A robust surveillance platform can also reinforce community adherence to behavioral interventions such as social distancing. In situations where contact tracing is feasible, all suspected cases and contacts of confirmed cases must be tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectively isolated. At the community level wastewater surveillance can identify areas where transmission is or is not occurring, and genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can help to elucidate the intensity of transmission independent of the number of known cases and hospitalizations.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, the tool most commonly used to convey statistical information about the spread of the virus has been time-series graphs about the cumulative number of cases. When drawing such graphs, analysts have to make design decisions which can have dramatic effects on citizens’ interpretations. Plotting the COVID-19 progression on a linear scale highlights an exponential “explosion” in the number of cases, whereas plotting the number of cases on a logarithmic scale produces a line with a modest-looking slope. Even if the two graphs display the exact same information, differences in visual design may lead people to different substantive conclusions. In this study, we measure the causal effect of different visualization design choices on Canadians’ views about the crisis. We report results from a survey experiment conducted in April 2020 with a sample of 2500 respondents.

By deliberately attempting to build readiness, there is potential to improve how programs implementation innovations. This article presents the results of a research synthesis that reviewed 1) how readiness has been addressed in the literature (e.g., are multiple subcomponents addressed in the same study?), 2) 
how changeable the different components (motivation, innovation-specific capacities, and general capacities) and sub-components of readiness are when deliberately targeted by supportive interventions (tools, training, technical assistance (TA), quality assurance and quality improvement (QA/QI)), and 3) the quality with which support strategies to address readiness are reported. Articles included in the synthesis generally reported targeting some, but not all, of the readiness subcomponents during implementation. Nearly all subcomponents can be increased, although there is variation in the quality of evidence supporting how changeable they are. However, there is little reported data about how well support strategies are implemented, which can inhibit the replication of specific techniques. These results can encourage support system providers who work with community-based organizations to think about how they can address and prioritize subcomponents of organizational readiness when adopting, implementing, and sustaining innovations.",TRUE,FALSE,capacity|implementation quality|implementation science|motivation|readiness,2020-04-12T03:34:47.895141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:34:31.479210,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/citation/,84cjq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e907dbfd6973502a8bdbc6c/,5e907dbfd6973502a8bdbc6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84cjq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/84cjq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/84cjq,NA

In this paper we present an initial release of a large hand-coded dataset of more than 4,500 separate policy announcements from governments around the world. This data is being made publicly available, in combination with other data that we have collected (including COVID-19 tests, cases, and deaths) as well as a number of country-level covariates. Due to the speed of the COVID-19 outbreak, we will be releasing this data on a daily basis with a 5-day lag for record validity checking. In a truly global effort, our team is comprised of more than 190 research assistants across 18 time zones and makes use of cloud-based managerial and data collection technology in addition to machine learning coding of news sources. We analyze the dataset with a Bayesian time-varying ideal point model showing the quick acceleration of more harsh policies across countries beginning in mid-March and continuing to the present. While some relatively low-cost policies like task forces and health monitoring began early, countries generally adopted more harsh measures within a narrow time window, suggesting strong policy diffusion effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian|coronavirus|COVID19|item response theory|policy response,2020-04-12T03:31:20.661116,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:30:56.355464,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/citation/,dkvxy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6j7sm/,6j7sm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e904f91d697350283bdc5c1/,5e904f91d697350283bdc5c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkvxy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dkvxy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dkvxy,NA
