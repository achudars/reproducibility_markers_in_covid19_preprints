The connectionist theory of cognition suggests that individuals have mental models composed of associations between concepts. Moreover, structuralist perspectives consider beliefs form an interrelated system. Therefore, the estimation of causal effects of beliefs is undermined by these interdependent relationships of beliefs. This article introduces factorial surveys (FS) as a useful method to solve these potential problems. To demonstrate the appropriateness of this method, this study presents a design and application of FS to a representative sample of Chileans and their beliefs about what determines happiness. The findings provide a folk theory (or a lay theory) of happiness determinants, where health is the most important determinant of happiness, followed by income and lifestyles. In addition, the reliability and cognitive bias of FSs are addressed, finding support for their applicability in developing countries. A potential reduction of social desirability bias in FSs is discussed in the conclusions.",TRUE,FALSE,endogeneity|Factorial survey|folk theory|happiness beliefs,2019-04-11T17:08:10.966077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T17:07:10.829164,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/citation/,sn8q9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7dnbe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/relationships/node/,7dnbe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caed9e7353c58001997a90c/,5caed9e7353c58001997a90c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sn8q9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sn8q9,NA

This chapter focuses on the fact- finding aspect. In this sense, science can be viewed as a process of signal detection for facts. We wish to discover true associations between variables. However, our methods for measurement are imprecise. We sometimes mistake noise for signal, and vice versa. How we conceptualize the scientific enterprise shapes how we go about the business of conducting research as well as how we strive to improve scientific practices. In this chapter, I’ll present several models of science. I’ll begin by showing ways in which the classic “hypothesis testing” model of science is misleading, and leads to flawed inferences. As a remedy, I’ll discuss models that treat science as a population process, with important dynamics at the group level that trickle down to the individual practitioners.

Since 2016 the oil and gas market has gone through a period of rebalancing, resulting in modest recovery in prices. Oil price recovery reached a peak of $85/bbl in October 2018. Gas prices have also achieved similar modest price recovery. The industry has now entered an expansion phase: the five largest international oil companies exceeded expectations for 2018. The outlook for gas is encouraging. It is projected that gas will supply the largest share of energy demand growth, supplying over 40% of additional demand by 2035. Also, the United Nations 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change has led to a re-emphasis on gas as a ‘transition’ ‘cleaner’ fuel.

Using data from 30 European countries, I explore this issue through examining three questions: 1) is class identity associated with highbrow consumption; 2) does this association vary across countries; and 3) is the relationship between class identity and highbrow consumption altered when the majority of people in a given society identify as either ‘working-class’ or ‘middle-class’? After accounting for other socio-demographic controls, people who identify as middle-class are more active highbrow consumers than those who identify as working class. Yet, the distinctiveness of middle-class consumption of highbrow culture varies across countries and is negatively correlated with how many people identify as working-class in a society. As more people identify as working-class (rejecting middle-class identities) highbrow culture less clearly distinguishes middle-class and working-class identifiers. In the absence of any class-structured divisions in highbrow culture, whether and how cultural practices function as a form of cultural capital is likely quite different, reinforcing the claim that the centrality of highbrow culture to cultural capital varies geographically.",TRUE,FALSE,class identity|cultural consumption|highbrow,2019-04-11T16:51:03.770436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T16:50:43.839895,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/citation/,u9dmy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xyqpa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/relationships/node/,xyqpa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cae441939926900170bf6cd/,5cae441939926900170bf6cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9dmy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9dmy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.04.002

Our Bayesian inference study is based on an extensive set of TAP lexical data from the online LexiRumah database (Kaiping &amp; Klamer, 2019). Systematically testing different approaches to cognate coding, loan exclusion, and explicit modelling choices, we arrive at a subgrouping structure of the TAP family that is based on features of the phylogenies shared across the different analyses.

However, the validity of the instrument has been barely assessed. The current study addressed the concurrent and content validity of four popular MAS items (justifiability of homosexuality, suicide, prostitution, and euthanasia). A sample of 493 Russians completed both MAS and the four validated multi-item scales. Results demonstrated that, except for the homosexuality item, the MAS items had low concurrent validity, explaining less than 50% of the variance of the corresponding multi-item scales. The MAS items underestimated the justifiability of homosexuality, prostitution, and suicide, and overestimated the justifiability of euthanasia. The MAS homosexuality item appeared to be a precise measure of attitude towards male (but not female) homosexuality, responses to the prostitution and suicide items overlooked the positive arguments, and the euthanasia item tapped more into attitudes towards euthanasia of a dying person. The four items showed strong dependence on the overall justifiability.

""Kr'stjani"" (mystics) vs ""Bogomili"" (dualists)","This paper in a simple and transparent way critically examines the rejected belief in science that Bosnian Church and its followers doctrinally and organisationally belonged to the dualist sect of Bogomilism. The research was carried out by a comparative analysis of the basic dualistic postulates of Gnosticism, Manichaeism and Bogomilism on the one hand and the available domestic sources of the Bosnian Church on the other. The importance of the work is reflected in the concise and detailed scientific argumentation that undermines ""Bogomil Bosnian Church"" myth, while offering a new scientific thesis on the religious and doctrinological affiliation of the ""Bosnian faith"" and the Bosnian ""krs'tjani"". In the first part, the paper deals with the problem of extreme and moderate dualism, with a special emphasis on the Neognostic, Neomanichaean and Bogomil communities in medieval Balkans. In the second part, the basic premises of Christian mysticism are given, including the possibility of its philosophical and theological compatibility with the teachings of the Bosnian Church, where for the first time the phenomenon of the name ""kr'stjani"" is explained in relation to the mystical union (""unio mystica"").",TRUE,FALSE,apocalypse|bogomilism|Bosnian Church|christian mysticism|dualism|extreme dualism|gnosticism|krstjani|manichaeism|moderate dualism|new testament|ordo de Bulgaria|ordo de Drugonthia|ordo de Sclavonia,2019-04-10T12:05:41.967473,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-10T12:05:21.338300,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|Arts and Humanities|Religion|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d21|Arts and Humanities|Medieval Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/citation/,3v26f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cadb76ae3915600175eb0db/,5cadb76ae3915600175eb0db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3v26f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3v26f,NA

Informed by this framework, we estimate the direct effects of class destination and class origin, the effect of own intergenerational class mobility as well as the effects of others’ class position and mobility (so-called reference effects). To do so, we utilize European Social Survey (ESS) waves 1 to 5 (2002-2010). We obtain information on life satisfaction as well as destination and origin class for about 100,000 respondents in 32 European countries. Our mobility analyses are performed with diagonal reference models, which allow for the consistent estimation of mobility effects. We find: (1) Class destination consistently and strongly structures life satisfaction across Europe. (2) Own class mobility positively impacts life satisfaction, particularly in Eastern Europe. (3) Other’s class mobility has a strong negative effect on life satisfaction. Especially the latter finding points to the hitherto neglected importance of reference effects when considering the impact of social class on
