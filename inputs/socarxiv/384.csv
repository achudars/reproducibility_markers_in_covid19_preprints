They also avoid out-party news sources. We link these developments and argue that, absent direct experience, partisans assess out-party media based off negative and inaccurate stereotypes. This means cross-cutting exposure that challenges these misperceptions can improve assessments of out-party media. To support this argument, we use survey-linked web browsing data to show the public has hostile views of out-party news sources they rarely encounter. We conduct three survey experiments that demonstrate cross-cutting exposure to non-political or neutral political coverage – forms of news widely available from partisan sources online – reduces oppositional media hostility. These findings explain how perceptions of rampant bias from out-party media coexist with modest differences in the online content major partisan news outlets provide. More broadly, we illustrate how negative misperceptions can sustain animus towards an out-group when individuals avoid direct encounters with them.",TRUE,FALSE,Media Reputation|Oppositional Media Hostility|Partisan Selective Exposure|Political Misperceptions,2019-09-27T17:20:23.878717,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27T17:20:14.293171,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CCV1NN,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/citation/,2a7q9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8ce486c8a75d001761ebf2/,5d8ce486c8a75d001761ebf2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a7q9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2a7q9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2a7q9,NA

Over-research refers to a situation where the host community are not benefiting from research activity conducted by outsiders.  Ethics dumping refers to doing research deemed unethical in a researcher’s home country in a foreign setting with laxer ethical rules. We briefly review the origins of these terms and explore their relevance for archaeology, with special consideration of Southeast Asia.

The results indicate that, although lying and violent acts augur negative consequences for those who commit them, their associations with core religious values diverge in the final outcome for the folktale characters. Lying that serves a religious mission of either Confucianism or Taoism (but not Buddhism) brings a positive outcome to a character (βT_and_Lie_O= 2.23; βC_and_Lie_O= 1.47; βT_and_Lie_O= 2.23). A violent act committed to serving Buddhist missions results in a happy ending for the committer (βB_and_Viol_O= 2.55). What is highlighted here is a glaring double standard in the interpretation and practice of the three teachings: the very virtuous outcomes being preached, whether that be compassion and meditation in Buddhism, societal order in Confucianism, or natural harmony in Taoism, appear to accommodate two universal vices—violence in Buddhism and lying in the latter two.

Zur Kartierung eines vernachlässigten Gebiets der Wissenschaftssoziologie,"This contribution reconstructs the discursive construction of the humanistic notion of ""Bildung"" and the transformation of the field of the German humanities since the beginning of the 19th century. On the basis of academic self-reflections within the humanities, the analysis investigates how the discursive construction of ""Bildung"" is responsive to changes in the broader social field in which the discourse is embedded. At the same time, this discourse shows a remarkable persistence against social change. The historically stable topoi of a decidedly ""free"" and ""scientific"" ""Bildung"" are elements of a strategy of academic positioning that facilitates distinction in favor of the humanities.

Drawing on data for 13,807 polling stations published by the Egyptian Electoral Authority, it uses the Election Forensics Toolkit to estimate a series of digit and distribution tests. The results point to statistical anomalies in voter turnout for polling stations located in Egypt’s major population centers. The findings align with journalistic accounts of very low turnout in those areas and demonstrate how tools from electoral forensics can be applied to the study of elections in the Middle East and North Africa.",TRUE,FALSE,Authoritarianism|Egypt|Election forensics|Electoral fraud|El-Sisi|Repression,2019-09-27T00:19:23.859356,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-26T15:13:40.354387,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/citation/,4wf9s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8c6355c43280001bc30ff5/,5d8c6355c43280001bc30ff5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wf9s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4wf9s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4wf9s,NA

The article illustrates this with a case study of UK history departments and their assessment by the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and the Research Excellence Framework (REF), drawing on data from the three most recent assessments (RAE 2001, 2008, REF 2014). Symptoms of stratification are documented by the distribution of memberships in assessment panels, of research active staff, and of external research grants. Symptoms of a standardization are documented by the publications submitted to the assessments. The main finding is that the RAEs/REF and the selective allocation of funds they inform consecrate and reproduce a disciplinary center that, in contrast to the periphery, is well-endowed with grants and research staff, decides in panels over the quality standards of the field, and publishes a high number of articles in high-impact journals. This selectivity is oriented toward previous distributions of resources and a standardized notion of “excellence” rather than research performance.",TRUE,FALSE,Bourdieu|higher education|History|performance assessment|Research Assessment Exercise|Research Excellence Framework|Standardization|Stratification,2019-09-26T15:13:24.772828,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-26T15:12:54.652663,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/citation/,v5wrs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8c609e4ab86b0018f0ee9e/,5d8c609e4ab86b0018f0ee9e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5wrs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v5wrs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v5wrs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-015-9974-7
