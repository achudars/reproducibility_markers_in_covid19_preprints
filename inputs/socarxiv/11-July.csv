While some qualitative and quantitative work has addressed the question, the relationship between social policies influence and fathering remains largely unquantified. This study addresses this gap in the literature by linking micro-level data from more than 5,000 fathers in five countries to quantified levels of gender inequality, political empowerment, and economic empowerment from the United Nations and World Economic Forum. Using mixed regression models, I show that gender inequality acts as a barrier to men’s involvement in instrumental and expressive parenting. In contrast, female economic empowerment is associated with increased paternal engagement, while political empowerment is associated with instrumental, but not expressive, fathering. These results suggest that social policies play an important role in shaping paternal roles, responsibilities, and behaviours.

Smallpox has so far largely escaped this revived scholarly scrutiny, despite its century-long status as one of the deadliest and widespread of all infectious diseases. Literature has demonstrated that important differences between rural and urban communities, and between cities, but has so far failed to address disparities within cities due to varying living conditions and disease environments. This article examines the last nationwide upsurge of smallpox in the Netherlands through the lens of Amsterdam’s 50 neighbourhoods in the period 1870-1872. We use a mixed methods approach combining qualitative spatial analysis and OLS regression to investigate which part of the population was affected most by this epidemic in terms of age and sex, geographic distribution across the city, and underlying socio-demographic neighbourhood characteristics such as relative wealth, house density, crude death rate, and birth rate. Our analyses reveal a significant spatial patterning of smallpox mortality that can largely be explained by existing socio-demographic neighbourhood characteristics.

Indicators based a fixed ``old’’ age threshold have been widely used for assessing socioeconomic disparities in mortality at older ages. Interpretation of long-term trends and determinants of these indicators is challenging because mortality above a fixed age that in the past would have reflected old age deaths is today mixing premature and old-age mortality. We propose the modal (i.e. most frequent) age at death, $M$, an indicator increasingly recognized in aging research, but which has been infrequently used for monitoring mortality disparities at older ages. 

Methods
We use mortality and population exposure data by occupational class over the 1971-2017 period from Finnish register data. The modal age and life expectancy indicators are estimated from mortality rates smoothed with penalized B-splines.

Results
Over the 1971-2017 period, occupational class disparities in life expectancy at 65 and 75 widened while disparities in $M$ remained relatively stable. The proportion of the group surviving to the modal age was constant across time and occupational class. In contrast, the proportion surviving to age 65 and 75 has roughly doubled since 1971 and showed strong occupational class differences. 

Conclusions
Increasing socioeconomic disparities in mortality based on fixed old age thresholds may be a feature of changing selection dynamics in a context of overall declining mortality. Unlike life expectancy at a selected fixed old age, $M$ compares individuals with similar survival chances over time and across occupational classes. This property makes trends and differentials in $M$ easier to interpret in countries where old-age survival has improved significantly.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-26T20:19:33.484374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-26T20:18:57.218722,FALSE,NA,no,Researchers should contact Statistics Finland for accesss to the data.,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/citation/,e7c4d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d5a07ce779a500e8a0b589/,60d5a07ce779a500e8a0b589,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7c4d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e7c4d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e7c4d,NA

While the consequences of MI are often easily detected, the specific pathways through which MI affects decision-making are context-dependent and under-investigated. We employed an information-theoretic model selection approach to characterize relationships between multiple indicators of MI and three outcomes commonly associated with MI, waist circumference (n = 431), systolic blood pressure (n = 472), and age at first reproduction (n = 974), among adult matrilineal Mosuo participants from 505 households in six villages in southwest China. Different MI indicators, distributed across individual, household, and community levels of social organization, predicted these three outcomes, demonstrating that individuals’ personal circumstances, household structure, and community affect how they experience and respond to MI. We emphasize the importance of identifying and measuring multiple context-appropriate indicators of MI across levels of social organization.

Over the centuries, this phenomenon has attracted the attention of scholars and visitors alike — perhaps more so than the 17 contrade, the city’s territorial communities that participate in the event. Our aim is twofold. First, we provide a primer on the contemporary contrada system. Second, we describe systematically the relationships between contrada pairs, which can be classified into one of three types: alliance, neutral relationship, and rivalry. To this end, we draw on published materials and on recent field-based research, including a cross-contrada survey of over 500 contrada members, a psychological item measuring the attitude of members towards the contrade, and the analysis of GPS data from an annual ritual. We find that membership size varies from a few hundred to several thousand individuals, a majority of whom are members from birth with familial and social ties within the contrada. We also find patterned variation with respect to relationship type in the attitude of contrada members, as well as in ritualized behaviour. We highlight the importance of the contrada phenomenon and the impact of group relationship on perceptions and behaviour.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|community membership|contrada|inter-group relations|Italy|palio|ritual|Siena,2021-06-25T17:14:07.349147,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-25T17:13:49.896837,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,Adam R Kenny|Laura Fortunato,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/citation/,hxyvc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d4b6b2e779a500a2a0f09e/,60d4b6b2e779a500a2a0f09e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxyvc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hxyvc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hxyvc,NA

Using Orbis data on over 28,000 US financial firms, and sociodemographic data on 806 founders and managers in key firms, we show that neo-patrimonial elements, such as hybrid legal forms and trust relationships, are spreading within finance. Our findings show that hedge and private equity funds rely heavily on secretive hybrid forms in which “elite white men” benefit from baked in advantages. Financialization is not a modernization process but a recombination of bureaucracy and neo-patrimonial logics.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic sociology|Neo-patrimonialism|Sociology of elites|Sociology of finance,2021-06-25T16:54:01.264544,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-25T16:53:45.148762,FALSE,NA,no,"Data part of the SNSF project ""The rise of the financial elite"" : https://www.unil.ch/obelis/fr/home/menuinst/projects/current-projects/the-rise-of-the-financial-elite.html",,no,"Plan of the SNSF project ""The rise of the financial elite"" : https://www.unil.ch/obelis/fr/home/menuinst/projects/current-projects/the-rise-of-the-financial-elite.html",,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Fabien Foureault|Lena Ajdacic|Felix Bühlmann,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/citation/,8c6yz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d4a6b1e779a5009aa0c97e/,60d4a6b1e779a5009aa0c97e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c6yz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8c6yz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8c6yz,NA
