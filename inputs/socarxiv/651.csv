Critical theorists like Adorno call it free time and warn of capitalism’s propensity to subvert it. Whereas boredom has traditionally been a boon for humanity in its propensity to force contemplation that leads to creativity, in modernity it has been succumbed to en masse and therefore no longer plays its role of detecting the human threshold preceding anger. Critical analyses have prompted many to search for a particular style of boredom, a pursuit of its quiddity in order to crack its style, which in a milieu where method and style is everything equates to numerous staid attempts. While genre identifying stylistic markers perhaps do exist in the generic sense that the plays and novels included in this proposed corpus are typically about white, privileged, and post-lapsarian moderns dealing with vertiginous existential issues, positing an exact style remains intractable. This paper, while not an exhaustive examination of the texts, posits=nevertheless that purported stylistic markers are not consistent or discernable. What is more plausible, rather, is that dispossession affects productions and critical readings. Humans all seek meaning and as it was traditionally signified in cosmologies that no longer provide import in the cultural zeitgeist of western productions about the mundane, the loss of immanence has desultorily impacted artistic expression and the ethos of the poet.",TRUE,FALSE,Adorno|boredom as genre|critical theory|free time|literature|meaning|shamelessness|style of boredom,2018-07-02T11:22:43.079331,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:38:34.635093,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/citation/,58e26,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7v4tu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/relationships/node/,7v4tu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07cfc06c613b0263acf6bf/,5a07cfc06c613b0263acf6bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58e26/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58e26/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58e26

The study illuminates certain features of Africana Womanism reflected in Nervous Conditions to explore the deep meaning of the African woman experience. Though it is created by an African American intellectual, Hudson-Weems, Africana Womanism transcends the borders of the United States to absorb the needs and aspirations of women from Africa. Reading the novel from the perspective of Africana womanism challenges the view of categorizing Dangarembga as a feminist and her novel in the mainstream of feminist literature on the one hand, and helps to gain more comprehensive understanding of the novel on the other; hence, lies the importance and novelty of the study. To execute this goal, the researcher highlights the most salient attributes of Africana womanism which the female characters in Nervous Conditions fictionally exhibit as: self-namer, self-definer, authentic, complete, and genuine in sisterhood, family centered, male compatible, mothering and nurturing. Utilizing the approach of Africana womanism, all marginalized women should cooperate in creating their own paradigm which stems from their own social reality and reflects their cultural autonomy and integrity.",TRUE,FALSE,Africana womanism|African literature|black woman writings|Dangarembga|Nervous Conditions,2018-07-02T11:22:43.038754,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:35:17.068506,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/citation/,dg64t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zdqc6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/relationships/node/,zdqc6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07cedb6c613b0264acfb36/,5a07cedb6c613b0264acfb36,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dg64t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dg64t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dg64t

It examines the condition of displacement and its effects on the identity of the female protagonists in two short stories written by Ahdaf Soueif: Sandpiper and Melody. The researcher’s investigation relies on recent postcolonial criticism provided by Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha. As such, this paper explores: the representation of the Arab culture in the the Western thought; the way linguistic hegemony is subverted through the use of a hybridized version of  English; and the agency of the subaltern through using the English language as a vehicle for the transmission of Diasporic Arab female voices and concerns. This paper concludes that Ahdaf Soueif succeeds in painting an original view of the effect of the state of displacement on the psyche of her female subjects, highlighting the semi-autobiographical aspect which is used as a means to express a quest for identity.

This article investigates the experiences of Saudi under-preparation-translators in a Computer Aided Translation (CAT) course that was introduced using the PBL method.

It uses Edward Said’s theory of Orientalism to demonstrate how ‘sexuality’ as an attributed Western discourse about the Prophet (pbuh) developed into exotic ideas embodied in the image of the Arabs and Turks. The analysis explores three main leitmotifs that help shape the idea of the ‘Prophet’s sexuality’, namely the harem, slavery and the notion of the ‘Mohammaden Paradise’, all of which have implicit or direct referencing to the Prophet (pbuh). This article attempts to show how Orientalist travelogues in particular, have contributed to a very negative conception of Muhammad (pbuh) and his marital life—an image that unfortunately persists until today. The discourse carries with it a familiar yet dangerous binary attitude that continuously positions the West and Muslims antithetically.

Semantic content is not always sufficient to fully comprehend the exact meaning of a particular utterance as the meaning of that utterance may hinge upon the contextual detail with which it is inferentially associated. The success of the process of communication relies on whether or not the recipient makes use of the context intended by the speaker. Failure to do so would give rise to miscommunication (Gutt, 1998, p. 42). Translation, as a communicative act, involves interpretation made by the translator, which takes the context of the target text (TT) reader and his/her knowledge into consideration. The present paper argues that even though the translator, according to relevance theory, is required to reproduce a TT that can stand as a faithful rendering of the source text (ST), the translator, however, needs to make his/her translated text relevant to the target reader. This, in many instances, may demand following certain procedures of explications in the TT to equip the target reader with the relevant contextual information needed to draw the appropriate inferences from the utterance concerned, and therefore make the right interpretation. Such exegesis needs to be added to the target text as what is inferable for the ST user may not be inferable for the TT receiver owing to cognitive and cultural differences.",TRUE,FALSE,Communication|inference|interpretation|relevance theory|translation,2018-07-02T11:22:42.800579,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T04:01:11.503531,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/citation/,26zax,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ubjn9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/relationships/node/,ubjn9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07c6d6594d9002657cab71/,5a07c6d6594d9002657cab71,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zax/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26zax/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26zax

This paper investigates the translation of community texts into Arabic in Australia, which aims at providing social justice to migrants and maintaining their languages and cultures. Despite the existence of an established national body and institutions that accredit and train translators, translation for Arab migrants still suffers from problems that hinder these goals and render lip service to the Arabic language because of the prevalence of subjective interference and inappropriate transfer process. This paper discusses the challenges, and investigates the competency of translators and their ability to deal with the cultural dominance of the host country. It investigates and suggests solutions to the factors that impact on the process of producing accurate and accessible translation. As such, it addresses the peculiarities of the types, styles and language of texts requiring translation, as well as the peculiarities of the Australian public service system and terminologies.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|accuracy|and translation quality|community translation|interference,2018-07-02T11:22:42.764711,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T03:54:46.476311,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/citation/,yz279,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jya8e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/relationships/node/,jya8e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07c54b9ad5a1026c02cdb8/,5a07c54b9ad5a1026c02cdb8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yz279/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yz279/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yz279

Romeo and Juliet (1597) and Othello (1604) are tragedies of sweeping passion and rash action where love falters and lovers fall. In her 1988 play entitled Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet), Ann-Marie MacDonald parodies the two Shakespearean texts and visits the intersections between genre and gender where tragedy modulates into comedy and liminal gender identities fade in and out across permeable genre spaces. The protagonist of the play, Constance Ledbelly, is sucked into the wonderland of her unconscious mind where she outwits her opponents, Iago and Tybalt, and moderates the extremes of her avatars, Desdemona and Juliet. She thus breaks free from her stalking shadow, Night the Professor, and realises that she is the unwitting author of the play. Her unconscious leap onto the stages of mourning becomes a farewell to the night, and a greeting of the morning that becomes the queerness of the postmodernist world—laughing off its past and laughing at its present. The golden pen which Constance finds at the end of her toying with genre, language, and gender is a reward for the author who takes refuge in a world where the fool of court is king of wit, and where the pandemonium of tragedy becomes the playground of parody. The author of this paper studies the alchemy of Constance’s change and MacDonald’s reconsideration of genre and gender through parody, the postmodern philosopher’s stone. He also argues for a politics of identity revisiting the aesthetics of mourning.",TRUE,FALSE,comedy|gender|identity|parody|subversion|tragedy,2018-07-02T11:22:42.730945,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T03:50:27.308988,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/citation/,szx9g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9p8ez/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/relationships/node/,9p8ez,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07c3dfb83f69026586f1de/,5a07c3dfb83f69026586f1de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szx9g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/szx9g/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/szx9g
