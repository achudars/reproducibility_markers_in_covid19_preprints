It aims at identifying the contextual meanings of these words based on different exegeses of the Holy Qur'ān. Then, it explains the nuances that exist between the two lexical items. The study also examines how the shades of meaning of the Qur'ānic words are reflected in two English translations of the Holy Qur'ān, namely, Arberry (2003) and Irving (2002). The study adopts the RC-S approach by Murphy (2003) as a theoretical framework for data analysis. It also employs the qualitative approach to collect and analyze the data of the study. Different exegeses are consulted to identify the differences between the two words.

This paper aims at exploring the possibility that literature could be an alternative means to do comparative studies of certain religious aspects from different religion. It focuses on the name and the significance of the name of Pearl in Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter which alludes to the Bible. This paper however will examine the name from different angle; that is from an Islamic point of view, for the purpose of a comparison. Pearl is also mentioned in Al-Qur’an and some Hadiths; therefore they will be the main sources to analyze the view on pearl. The result is that The Scarlet Letter shows the vivid image of Pearl in Islam. Pearls in Islam have both worldly and spiritual significance with their special characteristics such as being natural, beautiful, pure, invaluable and demanding great price and effort to gain them.

The study is based on scrutinizing two copies of the film The Wolf of Wall Street which has been subtitled by fans in two different Arab countries, Jordan and Lebanon.  The study is designed to analyze the Arabic subtitles generated in each DVD to understand how subtitlers from each country deal with different problematic issues and distasteful topics in the film, including utterances related to sexuality, swear words andreferences to embarrassing bodily functions. The study applies the model of euphemisation in subtitling proposed by Al-Adwan(2015) which has beenderived primarily from two existing models of euphemisation presented by Williams (1975) and Warren (1992). The applied model has managed to address the majority of the problematic instances and has also identified strategies adopted to tackle them in the Arabic subtitles. However, the model has not been able to account for other instances found in both DVDs where subtitlers also used dysphemism as a translation strategy.

The data of the present study is derived from an Egyptian television hard-edged drama entitled Firqit Naji Atallah (lit. Naji Atallah Team), Episode 1 (2012), subtitled by a sample of twenty MA translation students, ten of whom enrolled in the second semester for the academic year 2013/2014 and the rest (also totalling ten) did the same, a year later, namely for the school year 2014/2015. The article clearly reveals that before PRB approach is introduced in actual translation classroom, translator trainees (i.e. experimental group) are faced with tremendously difficult problems linguistically, culturally and technically which may hinder communication, thought to be crucial to retain for the target audience. The PRB approach is then introduced whereby the other translator trainees are equipped with some theoretical insights apropos of subtitling norms, well-envisaged in two scholarly AVT works by Karamitroglou (1998) and Schwarz (2002). Being aware of the PRB approach, the translator trainees could therefore do the translation task with minimal linguistic, cultural and technical problems.

This novel portrays two schools of ineffectual native educators who seem to be antagonists: the traditional old school and the new modern intellectuals. Postcolonial/race theories of Fanon, Appiah, Du Bois, and Woodson as well as Gramsci’s notion of the “organic intellectual” are employed to get a clearer image of the role of intellectuals and politicians in shaping the future of a country in the post-independence era. The article concludes that intellectuals with European education may contribute to the corruption of their country due to reasons like divided loyalties, miseducation, and lack of communication with the public. Additionally, Achebe is critical of the current politicians and the excluded public. So, our analysis employs Woodson’s concept of “the miseducation of the Negro” because such “miseducation” produces incompetent politicians like Chief Nanga, weak intellectuals like Odili Samalu, and ignorant people like the public in the novel. Real hope against governmental corruption in Achebe's satirical novel can be found in integrating the class of intellectual/political leaders and the public and in a different kind of indoctrination, neither colonial nor neo-colonial. The truly educated class and the “organic intellectuals” produced from the public are key solutions for a better ""Nigeria.""

Samples subjected to the analysis will be taken from the Odes of five bards, namely: Imru' al-Qais, Tarafa, Zuhair, Antara, and Labid.  The reason behind focusing on these odes is that they have cultural overtones that are difficult to capture in translation.  These sentences and phrases will be discussed and analyzed in details, and their emotive meanings at all levels will be compared to those in the ST.

Variation in the representation or display of language, however, remains a relatively understudied phenomenon. With this in mind, we present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the variation observed in the Linguistic Landscape (LL) of Pilsen, Chicago. A community undergoing perceived processes of gentrification, Pilsen is an active site of economic, sociocultural change as well as newly intensified language contact. To investigate Pilsen’s displayed language variation, we implement a series of logistic regression models that analyze the distribution of both language and contextual framing observed on signs in four key areas in Pilsen. In doing so, we present an informed means with which to understand the sociolinguistic context of Pilsen as a community undergoing change and provide a replicable framework for future study of LLs that experience similar dynamics.

We engage the theoretical concept of cultural chronotopes (Agha, 2007a) to demonstrate how spatially and temporally entwined experiences of nostalgia and modernity are produced in South Delhi’s commercial LL, and show how such positioning serves to compress or flatten such experiences for ready consumption (Kockelman, 2006). Focusing on particularized chronotopes tied to a privileged and elite experience, imagination and aspiration, we highlight how discourses of the ‘ideal’ are reproduced and positioned as visceral through specific references or semiotic arrangements. In so doing, we discuss the quantification of experience executed by these signs in commodifying the visceral, and the problematic way these instances propagate an idealized, sanitized and simplified understanding of Indian rural communities, Indian history and Indian traditional practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Chronotopes|Commodification|Hindi|India|Linguistic Landscapes|Nostalgia|Sociolinguistics,2018-07-02T10:47:36.443598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-16T18:55:16.446000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d17|Arts and Humanities|South and Southeast Asian Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d27|Arts and Humanities|Modern Languages|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/citation/,ajmg6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ssv5r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/relationships/node/,ssv5r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cade9e594d9001fa8ab9bf/,58cade9e594d9001fa8ab9bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ajmg6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ajmg6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ajmg6
