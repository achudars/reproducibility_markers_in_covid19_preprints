Chesnutt’s The Marrow of Traditions (1901). Chesnutt wrote his novel to reflect his opinions on how African Americans should act to improve their situation. To situate the study within the historical and cultural context of Marrow, Black intellectuals’ views, namely Washington and Du Bois, about the complicated problem of ‘color’ were explored. To analyze the contrasting views and actions of Chesnutt’s black characters, the paper uses the lens of postcolonial theory. Although Marrow is not set within a colonial context, postcolonial theoretical frameworks can be used as models to re-read this novel because they deal with intersections of races, classes, cultures, and the oppressor/ oppressed relationship. The paper concludes that Chesnutt has entertained the possibility of a hybrid or third race— as referred to within postcolonial framework—that may succeed where both races (pure white and black) have failed.",TRUE,FALSE,Bhabha|hybridity|mulatto|postcolonial theory|racism|The Marrow of Traditions|violence,2021-06-18T06:56:40.940830,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:56:17.293726,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/citation/,fb3td,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cbff483972e4000e3918fe/,60cbff483972e4000e3918fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fb3td/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fb3td/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no2.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fb3td

This paper aims to revisit Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners re-reading it in dialogue with Naipaul’s novel The Mimic Men. The selected novels are controversial. Criticism deployed on all fronts conveys the pluralities and oppositions that are in fact the novels’ hallmarks. Yet, the aspects criticized attest to, and confirm, the authors’ taking of the less trodden track. The comparative analysis within the scope of this paper will show that Naipaul’s and Selvon’s fictional representations of creolized Trinidadian and English societies highlight specific cultural and linguistic aspects and that intertextuality is either convergent or divergent. For instance, the structure of Naipaul’s text takes as much from Caribbean orature and the wake of Caribbean plantation culture. However, Selvon’s novel takes the form of flashbacks. Naipaul innovates and transforms Selvon’s structure to generate a Caribbean context, par excellence. Traces of Selvon’s style are present in Naipaul’s corrosive voice of representing Caribbean identity. Naipaul brings to an apotheosis the creative force already illustrated in the remarkable works of Selvon. This paper aims to track these traces and foreground the idea that texts can speak to each other. More significantly, this paper assesses the main characters’ fates to re-question the status of creoles, a status deliberately put between parentheses, denying them the right to voice their hybrid identities. Above all, the close textual reading of Galahad’s and Singh’s stories is meant to value the trope of intertextuality.",TRUE,FALSE,and the mimic men|appraisal|convergent intertextuality|creolized canon|divergent intertextuality|the lonely Londoners,2021-06-18T06:56:41.374885,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:56:30.471695,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/citation/,9n5kd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cbfe76d6bcbc000e0909da/,60cbfe76d6bcbc000e0909da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5kd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9n5kd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no2.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9n5kd

Specifically, we argue that in return for campaign contributions, Colombian mayors who rely on donor-funding (compared to those who do not) choose not to enforce sanctions against illegal deforestation activities. Using a regression discontinuity design we show that deforestation is significantly higher in municipalities that elect donor-funded as opposed to self-funded politicians. Further analysis shows that only part of this effect can be explained by differences is contracting practices by donor-funded mayors.

As a result, many different concepts, and characterisations about the violence in Mexico have arisen, but many of these, either borrowed from many fields of literature terms or new concepts, fall short to classify or explain the key differences from high scale violence involving organised crime and other types of violent conflicts such as civil wars. Also, considering the regional trend of high homicide rates in Latin America, especially in Central America and Brazil, it is relevant to build a new concept that can be useful, theoretically, and empirically, for the study of violence and conflict derived from involvement of organised crime, gangs, and other nonstate actors. In this article I review most of the academic and political commentary of the nature of the Mexican case and, from there, I analyse the different concepts proposed from two angles: first, a comparison with the characteristics of other high scale violent conflict concepts, and second, an examination of their utility in terms of theory, field studies, internal coherence, parsimony, familiarity, depth, differentiation, and familiarity. The aim of the comparison of different types of conflict is to assess how scholars use the literature from diverse fields to influence categorisation of new violent phenomenon. The examination of utility aims is to establish how these comparisons help or not to study of violence in Mexico and other Latin America cases of high scale violence of non-political conflicts, and how characterisations and evidence collected can enhance the understanding of violence with thebbuilding of a useful concept of this phenomenon.",TRUE,FALSE,Concept|Conflict|Drug War|Latin America|Violence|War,2021-06-18T06:58:01.540974,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:57:41.868831,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/citation/,d9ync,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cb82c5f3ce94057f24a75f/,60cb82c5f3ce94057f24a75f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9ync/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d9ync/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d9ync

I utilized the random-effects model to estimate the association between health indicators and non-regular employment across three waves.

Also, the transition or maintenance of temporary positions showed that mental health indicators were associated with the transition from regular to a temporary job but were not associated with the maintenance of temporary positions.

This pattern could mean that current childbearing cohorts will end up with fewer children than previous cohorts or this same pattern could be an artifact of a tempo distortion if individuals are simply postponing births they plan to eventually have. In this research note, we use data on current parity and future intended births from the 2006-2017 National Survey of Family Growth to shed light on this issue. We find that total intended parity declined (from 2.26 in 2006-2010 to 2.16 children in 2013-2017), and the proportion of women intending to remain childless increased slightly. Decomposition indicated that the decline was not due to changes in population composition, but rather changes in the subgroup rates themselves. The decline in intended parity is particularly notable at young ages and among Latinxs. These results indicate that although tempo distortion is likely an important contributor to the decline in TFR, it is not the sole explanation: U.S. individuals are intending to have fewer children than their immediate predecessors, which may translate into a decline in cohort completed parity. However, the change in intended parity is modest and average intended parity remains above two children.",TRUE,FALSE,Birth Rates|Childbearing|Fertility|Fertility Intentions,2021-06-17T15:21:34.403117,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-17T15:20:59.203448,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Caroline Sten Hartnett; Alison Gemmill,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/citation/,zxg2a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cb6189da0ff205663906e1/,60cb6189da0ff205663906e1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxg2a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zxg2a/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-020-00929-w,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zxg2a

It is based on an ethnographic study and semi-structured interviews at a delivery platform in Germany. The article argues that ser-vice platforms can be conceived of as dualistic meta-organisations. At the centre of the company is a complete organisation with membership rights and obligations. Be-yond the centre of the organisation, there is a peripheral organisation which is a hybrid between organisation and market. This partial organisation only provides limited rights and duties to its members. These conditional labour relations in the digital economy can be seen as a modern-ized organisational match of precarious labour relations in the form of contingency work. Within this structure, em-ployees thus experience new forms of insecurity.",TRUE,FALSE,delivery|ethnography|organisational culture|platform economy|precarity,2021-06-18T07:01:21.461069,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T07:01:11.363919,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/citation/,vz4e7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cb4923da0ff2055a39821d/,60cb4923da0ff2055a39821d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vz4e7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vz4e7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vz4e7
