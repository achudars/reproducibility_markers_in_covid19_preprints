skilled in order to facilitate the healing of patients? To answer this
question, this paper takes as its case study the clinical practice of
George Atwood, the phenomenological psychoanalyst whose book, *The Abyss of
Madness*, describes his work with patients embroiled in struggles with the
most serious psychological disorders. Atwood’s method is fundamentally
emancipatory in that it seeks to help the patient liberate himself from
psychological bondage to and enmeshment within the traumatic experiences
and oppressive social bonds that have shaped his excruciating experiential
world. The path toward this emancipation can only be based in truth, and as
such, Atwood’s method is predicated on the continual exercise of courage in
service of “the inner truth of a life."" The dedication to practice such
courage through the often-overwhelming encounter with the “blood” that,
according to Atwood, characterizes every healing analysis is born of what
can only be called deep love. In this context, love names a set of profound
inner resources the therapist brings to his own comportment and conduct,
and by extension and implication the overall trajectory of the patient’s
life. This paper explores several specific analytic practices through which
the love of the analyst meets and is co-translated into the subjective
experience of the patient, enabling him through embodied presence, example,
and guidance to re-structure the world of his experience in ways that are
more open, more life-giving, and ultimately more loving to self and other.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,diagnosis|george atwood|method|phenomenological psychoanalysis|Preprint|psychoanalysis|psychotherapy|self psychology|socarxiv|symptomatology|technique,2018-07-02T10:52:03.872242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T05:32:05.688000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/citation/,r3d52,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bfjkm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/relationships/node/,bfjkm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578b18579ad5a101f8f5c504/,578b18579ad5a101f8f5c504,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r3d52/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r3d52

Several commentators, drawing on an analogy to computer software protection, have suggested copyright law as an alternative method of protecting recombinant DNA innovation. This article reviews these arguments in light of recent court decisions and scholarly commentary concerning copyright of computer software.  The article argues that copyright law is not sacrosanct, but rather represents a particular scope of proprietary interests that may be used to accommodate the needs of new technologies such as biotechnology. The article asserts, however, that the decision to apply copyright protection to such a technology should be based on policy rather than on analogy.

Much recent scholarship and considerable governmental attention has been focused on adapting and expanding copyright to encompass digital works of authorship. These efforts have been justified on the grounds that clear property rights are necessary to allow efficient allocation of intellectual property between private parties.  However, these rationales ignore the literature regarding the efficiency of unclear or ""muddy"" property entitlements. Where transaction costs of private bargaining are high, ""muddy"" rules will tend to force parties into informal bargaining transactions. Transaction costs on the Internet may tend to be high because of the number of parties involved, the difficulty of locating the parties, increased opportunity for strategic behavior, and the transborder nature of the medium. Thus, informal transactions or ""self-help"" may be the most efficient means for provision of digital works.
