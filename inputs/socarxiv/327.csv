What happens when a legally marginalized group attains increased rights but not full political or social inclusion? In particular, what are the mental health implications of these transitions for impacted groups? We bring together theories of liminal legality and stress process to offer a framework for understanding how expansions in the legal rights of a highly politicized and vulnerable social group can be initially beneficial, but can attenuate due to renewed or new stress events, chronic stressors, and anticipatory stressors. We use the case of Latina/o immigrant youth who transitioned from undocumented legal status to temporarily protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Unpacking the Refugees-Terrorism Nexus","Widespread fear that hosting refugees will mean more terrorism in host states is at the heart of the `refugee crisis'. Yet, we lack rigorous evidence for such claims. This article theoretically unpacks how and under what conditions transnational refugee movements plausibly lead to different types of terrorist outcomes. Combining original data  with a multi-pronged approach involving a treatment-placebo design as well as instrumental variable estimation, we provide systematic and robust evidence that sheds new light on the security implications of forced migration. Our findings challenge the claim that hosting refugees heightens the risk of ``importing'' terrorist attacks against nationals of host countries, especially in developed countries. However, in these countries refugees themselves are particularly prone to becoming the targets of terrorist attacks by natives, driven by fear and revenge.

This approach overlooks perceptions of appropriate behavior for men and gender dynamics within families. We use nationally representative data of 12th-grade students from Monitoring the Future surveys (1976–2014) to evaluate changes in youths’ preferred division of labor arrangements. Over this period, contemporary young people exhibited greater openness to a variety of division of labor scenarios for their future selves as parents, although the husband-as-earner/wife-as-homemaker arrangement remained most desired. Using latent class analysis, we identify six configurations of gender attitudes: conventionalists, neo-traditionalists, conventional realists, dual-earners, intensive parents, and strong intensive parents. There are no gender egalitarian configurations—exhibiting equal support for both parents’ time at work and time at home.

Population growth increases both the number of mouths a society must feed and the number of people working to feed them. The balance between these two forces depends on the population's age structure. Although age structure ultimately reflects individual fertility and mortality, it is households that make decisions about the production and consumption of food, and their decisions depend on interactions with all other households in a settlement. How do these organizational levels interact to influence population growth and regulation? Here, I present a multi-level agent-based model of demography, food production, and social interaction in agricultural societies. I use the model to simulate the interactions of individuals, households, and settlements in a food-limited environment, and investigate the resulting patterns of population growth. Using Roman North Africa as a motivating example, I illustrate how abstract properties like ""carrying capacity"" emerge from the concrete actions and interactions of millions of individual people. Looking forward, bottom-up simulations rooted in first principles of human behavior will be crucial for understanding the coevolution of preindustrial societies and their natural environments.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|agricultural decision-making|carrying capacity|food-limited demography,2019-08-22T15:32:23.061082,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22T15:31:39.169811,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/citation/,5be6a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5dc247884b6600175ccab2/,5d5dc247884b6600175ccab2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5be6a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5be6a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5be6a,NA

One ideal that unites us is that we typically perceive of ourselves as contributing to the public good by helping to understand and preserve the past (Chippindale 1994). We act as stewards for archaeological sites and artefacts, and we work to correct misinformed views of the past that might have sinister motives. However, many of the current norms of archaeological practice are at odds with these ideals of archaeology. We share relatively little of our research with each other or the public. Typically we produce a journal article or monograph as a final product, but we rarely share the data files or computational methods that generated those final products, nor do we share our written work in ways that are readily accessible to the public. This suggests a gap between current practice and ideals. It also limits the reproducibility of our research, and the efficiency with which new methods can spread through the discipline. We show that an exploration of this mismatch between ideals and practice can reveal untapped potential for digital tools in archaeology to improve its sustainability as a research domain, and indicate new ways to engage with the public.

Relatively little is known about how demand-side market actors use online information and the implications for social stratification and mobility. This study provides an in-depth exploration of the online recruitment strategies pursued by human resource (HR) professionals. Qualitative interviews with 61 HR recruiters in two southern US metro areas reveal two distinct patterns in how they use Internet resources to fill jobs. For low and general skill work, they post advertisements to online job boards (e.g., Monster, CareerBuilder) with massive audiences of job seekers. By contrast, for high-skill or supervisory positions, they use LinkedIn to target passive candidates – employed individuals who are not looking for work but might be willing to change jobs. Although there are some intermediate practices, the overall picture is one of an increasingly bifurcated “winner-take-all” labor market in which recruiters focus their efforts on poaching specialized superstar talent (“purple squirrels”) from the ranks of the currently employed, while active job seekers are relegated to the hyper-competitive and impersonal “black hole” of the online job boards.",TRUE,FALSE,hiring|inequality|internet|job search|labor markets|recruitment|stratification,2019-08-22T15:38:23.100514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22T15:37:53.295355,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Emerald,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/citation/,36p2x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nmbze/,nmbze,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5c86189aa3820019fb46af/,5d5c86189aa3820019fb46af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/36p2x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/36p2x,https://doi.org/10.1108/S0277-283320190000033006

It articulates the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) of a given curriculum, together with the developmental trajectory that learning these KSAs is intended to follow. Mastery Rubrics have focused on graduate and post-graduate curricula, and utilize the European Guild Structure for staging growth and development of KSAs. Bloom’s taxonomy is also essential for describing the performance, and performance levels, in each stage. A defining characteristic of the Mastery Rubric is the Master level: the Master is qualified, with evidence, to take a learner from novice through to Master. However, the transition from competent independent performer of a set of KSAs to Master is not addressed in any of the Mastery Rubrics to date. This article describes three levels through which any instructor can progress in order to generate evidence they are qualified at the Master level for any Mastery Rubric, even those that have already been published to include a (single) Master level. These three levels describe the evidence that can be observed to represent early, middle, and late Master capabilities in terms of teaching, and assessing learning, in students and trainees. Two new Mastery Rubrics (MRs) have recently been completed, and neither has a Master level: one for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi) and one for the Nurse Practitioner (NR-NP). Although this new Mastery Rubric for the Master Level (MR-ML) can be used with all of the existing Mastery Rubrics to characterize the development of the Master’s engagement with theories and practicalities of learning, we use the MR-Bi and MR-NP to illustrate how the MR-ML can work with these two new MRs, and how individuals in any field can compile their evidence of the specific abilities to diagnose problems exhibited by those at earlier stages, devise remediating activities for those problems, and assess the result.",TRUE,FALSE,adult learning|cognitive psychology|faculty development|Mastery Rubric|preparing future faculty|teaching and learning,2019-08-23T13:35:45.133713,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-23T13:35:23.991580,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5e|Education|Higher Education|Scholarship of Teaching and Learning|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7c|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Adult and Continuing Education and Teaching|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7f|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Higher Education and Teaching,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/citation/,md65v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5c440d9aa3820018fa94d9/,5d5c440d9aa3820018fa94d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/md65v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/md65v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/md65v,NA

While OLS estimates show that BMI is significantly associated with worse mental health in both young adulthood and old age, they are likely to be confounded by (i) unobserved factors that affect both BMI and mental health and (ii) reverse causality. To tackle confounding, we take two complementary approaches. First, we use a polygenic score for BMI as an IV and adjust for polygenic scores for other factors that may invalidate this IV. The IV estimates indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between BMI and mental health for young adults, whereas there is a positive and statistically significant relationship for the elderly. Moreover, we show that IV estimates likely have to be interpreted as identifying a weighted average of effects of BMI on mental health mostly for individuals on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. Given potential remaining concerns about the validity of the IV, our second approach is to consider it an “imperfect” IV and estimate an upper bound on the average treatment effect for the corresponding population following Nevo &amp; Rosen (2012). The estimated upper bounds reinforce the conclusions from the IV estimates: they show little evidence of a detrimental effect of BMI on mental health for young adults while being consistent with an economically meaningful effect for elderly individuals. Lastly, we explore some of the potential channels through which BMI may affect mental health for the elderly.",TRUE,FALSE,depression|instrumental variables|mental health|obesity|polygenic scores,2019-08-22T15:40:02.811998,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22T15:39:42.063030,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/citation/,p6c3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5c06c5884b6600175bd1c7/,5d5c06c5884b6600175bd1c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p6c3g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p6c3g,NA
