Following the rise of the factory, the assembly line, and the office computer, some claim that we are now entering a fourth industrial revolution where autonomous systems are transforming the nature of work. What are the consequences of this transformation for intergenerational income mobility? Examining variation across 722 U.S. labor markets, we find that intergenerational persistence is higher in areas heavily exposed to industrial automation. These effects are rooted in childhood experiences and concentrated among men from disadvantaged homes. Unequal labor relations appear to exacerbate the association, while affordable access to college ameliorates it.

National tax policy under in-creasing financial transparency,"Why have OECD governments raised taxes on dividends at the shareholder level since 2008? Previous research points to the importance of budget deficits and voter demand for compensa-tory fairness in the aftermath of the financial crisis. We complement this literature by showing that the effect of domestic drivers of tax increases on capital income crucially depends on the level of financial transparency in a country’s investment network. Low financial transparency increases the risk of capital flight in response to a tax hike, whereas high financial transparency reduces this risk. Hence, governments facing fiscal pressure become more likely to raise taxes on capital income when transparency is high.

The Leech’s model (1983) consists of six maxims, and for Brown and Levinson (1987), consists of two major politeness strategies. It consists of two principles of politeness, where one of them is positive, and the other is negative politeness. This study aims at investigating politeness strategies, and politeness principle linguistically in two Suras from the Holy Quran, how politeness strategies and politeness maxims used within the Holy Quran.

In this paper, we will discuss the politeness strategies, positive and negative politeness strategies, and politeness maxims. The study falls into two parts. It begins briefly to overview the theoretical framework underlying politeness, in particular discussing some definitions of politeness and politeness principle and its maxims, exploring the face theory and its strategies by Brown and Levinson, and how far these strategies affect polite style then, dealing with politeness maxims by Leech. The other part displays a practical application of what has presented theoretically. Also, the researcher examined the politeness strategies, and politeness maxims of two Suras (Yusuf and Al-Kahf).

The experimental group received explicit, and integrated listening strategies instruction based on Siegel’s model of process-based listening strategy instruction (2015). The control group received the conventional teaching of listening without receiving any training in strategy process-based instruction over a semester (ten weeks). A modified version of the Foreign Language listening Anxiety Scale (FLLAS) developed by Elkhafaifi (2005) was taken by the participants once before and once after the intervention to measure their LA. The listening section of the Preliminary English Test (PET) used to measure the learners’ LC before and after the intervention. Findings showed that listening strategy instruction could decrease learners’ LA. Furthermore, a negative relationship found between LA and LC. The paper concluded with some useful pedagogical implications, and suggestions for further research are discussed based on the findings for researchers, teachers, and educators within the constraints of the Iraqi context.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-02-11T17:50:06.077277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:49:50.808701,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/citation/,h27rg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422dd07610e10032ca4c39/,5e422dd07610e10032ca4c39,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h27rg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h27rg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h27rg,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.4

One domain of particular interest is pragmatics, i.e., the ability to match language to context. This study aims at (a) investigating the pragmatic abilities of Iraqi patients with schizophrenia on both the production and comprehension level; (b) identifying which Grice's (1975) maxims do those patients most frequently violate; and (c) determining which of the demographic variables (gender, education, and age) has an influence on both the production and comprehension performance and violations. To this end, thirty patients were required to orally perform six pragmatic tasks using the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) (Arcara &amp; Bambini, 2016). Results revealed that first, patients' performance in comprehension is worse than that in production. Secondly, the most frequently violated maxim is that of quality. Thirdly, there were statistically substantial differences among patients on the comprehension level for education and age only, whereas results of violations of Grice's maxims recorded significant differences for all the three variables. The study concluded that people with schizophrenia might suffer from pragmatic deficits, particularly on the comprehension level, and that the degree of the difficulty of the task assigned along with the three variables could play a vital role in the degree of their performance. The findings of this study may be applied to the development of effective treatment strategies in schizophrenia.",TRUE,FALSE,APACS|Grice's maxims|Iraqi patients|pragmatic deficits|schizophrenia,2020-02-11T17:50:40.909545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:50:12.308925,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/citation/,bjwqf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422cc17610e10034ca4cc9/,5e422cc17610e10034ca4cc9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjwqf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bjwqf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bjwqf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.3
