Comparative decomposition analysis of mortality data, 2000-02 to 2015-17","Background
Annual gains in life expectancy in Scotland were slower in recent years than in the previous two decades. This analysis investigates how deaths in different age groups and from different causes have contributed to annual average change in life expectancy across two time periods: 2000-02 to 2012-14 and 2012-14 to 2015-17.  

Methods
Life expectancy at birth was calculated from death and population counts, disaggregated by five-year age-group and by underlying cause of death. Arriaga’s method of life expectancy decomposition was applied to produce estimates of the contribution of different age-groups and underlying causes to changes in life expectancy at birth  for the two periods.

Findings
Average annual life expectancy gains between 2012-14 to 2015-17  were markedly smaller than in the earlier period. Almost all age-groups saw worsening mortality trends, which deteriorated for most cause of death groups between 2012-14 and 2015-17. In particular, the previously observed substantial life expectancy gains due to reductions in mortality from circulatory causes, which most benefited those aged 55-84 years, more than halved. Mortality rates for those aged 30-54 years and 90+ years worsened, due in large part to increases in drug-related deaths, and dementia and Alzheimer’s disease respectively. 

Interpretation
Future research should seek to explain the changes in mortality trends for all age-groups and causes. More investigation is required to establish to what extent shortcomings in the social security system and public services may be contributing to the adverse trends and preventing mitigation of the impact of other contributing factors, such as influenza outbreaks.",TRUE,FALSE,decomposition|life expectancy|mortality|scotland,2019-07-15T13:31:03.181891,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-15T13:30:12.472128,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/citation/,q8rme,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2c450f114a42001609218f/,5d2c450f114a42001609218f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q8rme/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q8rme,NA

Effectively, the present study attempts to answer three main research questions, namely 1. Can rule-based phonology provide a satisfactory account of non-assimilatory processes such as epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic?  2. Can a syllable-devoid account of epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic be satisfactory? 3. Is the syllable indispensable in accounting for epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic? Indeed, the present study demonstrates that a syllable-devoid analysis provides unsatisfactory accounts of certain phonological epenthesis and deletion. In order to attain the aim of this study, instances of epenthesis and deletion in the Mostaganem spoken variety of Algerian Arabic are analysed. Such instances of epenthesis and deletion were obtained from the recorded speech of a randomly selected sample of fifty native speakers of Mostaganem Spoken Arabic. The findings of this study reveal the indispensability of the syllable in describing and explaining epenthesis and deletion in MTG by comparing a syllable-devoid account and a syllable-based account of such processes. Effectively, syllable-devoid account pertaining to The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky&amp;Halle, 1968) tradition proved short of explanations as to why epenthesis and deletion take place in Mostaganem spoken Arabic as contrasted to a syllable-based account which provides adequate and convincing explanations of those processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Account|deletion|epenthesis|Mostaganem Spoken Arabic|phonological processes|syllable|The Sound Pattern of English,2019-07-18T16:01:21.396168,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-18T16:01:02.847062,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/citation/,e9k7z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf4b345253a001c41cb1c/,5d2bf4b345253a001c41cb1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e9k7z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e9k7z,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.32

Pedagogical practices and related quality assurance mechanisms regulated by such approaches limit students’ ability to be original and skeptical in reflecting upon various issues of importance and concern based on their own thinking and experiences. Such a focus, in Sivasubramaniam’s (2015) and Nunn and Sivasubramaniam’s (2011) view, has entirely centered on bureaucratic efficiency aimed at having a uniform curriculum for the majority of the students and a scheme of research and evaluation based on recalls, think-alouds, cloze tests and multiple-choice questions in standardized texts. In line with the socially-aligned view of competence much needed spontaneity, flexibility, and diversity accrues only through a process-centered pedagogy of voice, agency and response. In the backdrop of this as a premise, this paper aims to demonstrate how Critical Thinking (CT) can be promoted in EIL classrooms as a discursive practice that could shape students’ voice, agency and inter-subjectivity in a cohesive framework. The paper shares both theoretical and practical ideas about CT and its importance in facilitating a meaningful education and aims to demonstrate some innovative tasks and activities that could be exploited to shape student’s voice and agency and develop their higher order CT skills. The paper culminates in evolving a practically viable prototype pedagogical framework for promoting CT as a social practice in EIL classrooms that is capable of making Wilga River’s (1983) notions of ‘skill-getting’ and ‘skill-using’ a reality. Such a model will be useful for EIL practitioners in designing similar lessons with innovative tasks and activities and make the EIL class atmosphere stimulating and pedagogically more fruitful.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-21T21:31:22.596259,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:30:55.761038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/citation/,ak2bu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf3f6114a420019065d5c/,5d2bf3f6114a420019065d5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ak2bu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ak2bu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ak2bu,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.31

Specifically, the objectives are to identify which categories of IMDMs are predominant in Arabic patent abstract and to explain how metadiscourse markers function in these abstracts. To achieve these objectives, data were analyzed quantitatively to count the frequency of IMDMs, and qualitatively to examine the functions of these markers within Arabic patent abstracts based on Hyland’s model (2005). The results indicate that boosters, hedges and attitude markers are the most frequently employed markers while the remaining categories show a low frequency of occurrence. Moreover, the analysis also reveals that IMDMs fulfill different functions, such as providing data in a truthful manner, avoiding commitment to precise figures and persuasion among others. The findings of this research are useful for Arabic-speaking drafters and novice inventors for a better understanding of IMDMs commonly applied in their patent abstracts. A better understanding of the pragmatic functions of IMDMs can improve not only patent drafting skills, but also the chance for successful patent grants.

When put in traditional competitive settings, students worry more about their self-esteem and tend to shy away from participating in the activities, while, only those with higher level of oral skills volunteer in answering the questions. This inequity in practice causes a discrepancy in students’ performance in the oral expression exams and thus, results in a gap in the achievement. This paper suggests cooperative learning as a means to reduce the achievement gap between high and low achievers in the oral expression classes. This study is an endeavor to highlight the effectiveness of cooperative learning in reducing the disparity between high and low achievers and also to accentuate the benefits of this method in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. The study followed an experimental pretest-posttest non-equivalent groups design with a sample of 44 second year EFL students from the University of Khenchela, Algeria. The intervention lasted for a semester. The results showed that the achievement gap was reduced in the experimental group after using cooperative learning instructions, while the traditional method, in the control group, failed in closing the achievement gap between high and low-achievers.

Research has demonstrated that children’s early exposure to Bloom’s Taxonomy levels in stories has a “remarkable power” on them (Dickinson, et al. 2012) and helps develop their language and critical-thinking skills (Egan, 1997; Curtain &amp; Dahlberg 2004). The aim of this research project is to investigate the role of Bloom’s Taxonomy in the development of the vocabulary and critical-thinking skills of young Moroccan English learners. The study adopts a qualitative approach and addresses two research questions, namely, (i) To what extent does Bloom’s Taxonomy contribute to the development of the children’s vocabulary and critical thinking skills? (ii) How can the children’s vocabulary and critical-thinking skills development be justified? The comparison and analysis of the children’s story reviews at the start and end of a term reveals significant improvement, among the Moroccan young learners, especially the average ones. They are able to use a wider range of more appropriate and accurate vocabulary and to make use of a more extended, analytical and relevant discourse. Hence, children’s early exposure to Bloom’s Taxonomy is highly recommended as it contributes to the development of their vocabulary and critical-thinking skills.",TRUE,FALSE,Accurate vocabulary|Bloom’s taxonomy|critical-thinking skills|English learning|language development|Moroccan children,2019-07-21T21:29:45.480879,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:29:27.020396,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/citation/,83bgn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bef851c5b4a001ba17258/,5d2bef851c5b4a001ba17258,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83bgn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/83bgn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/83bgn,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.26

Specifically, the research focuses on the attitudes of patients and staff towards communicating in English instead of Arabic, which is the primary official language in Saudi Arabia. First, the study addresses the question of how the dominance of English language in the selected medical context affects service delivery. Second, the study explores the attitude of patients and medical staff towards the dominance of the English language. Third, the study presents a comparison of the attitude of patients and medical staff towards the use of English language. Finally, the study responds to the question of how patients' level of education influences their attitude towards the use of English at the hospital. The study is based on quantitative research, involving 60 participants, where 30 patients and 30 medical staff. The findings reveal that 86.7% of medical staff members find it challenging to communicate with their patients in English. On the same note, 60% of patients interviewed admitted that they find it difficult understanding medical practitioners when they communicate in English. The findings can have significant practical implications since they show a possible communication barrier that can be addressed to improve patient experience at Bisha King Abdullah Hospital. The findings provide statistical evidence to inform evidence-based strategies to improve communication between patients and medical practitioners at the hospital.

Realizing this research gap, this study aims to analyze Gulf Arab, Non-Gulf Arab and English Faculty expectations about their roles in English studies. The objectives of the study were to answer four research questions: Do student-faculty expectations about their classroom roles correspond on nine given items; where do the differentiations lie; what are the classroom implications of these dissimilarities; and how teachers and students can share and meet each other’s expectations. Using a mixed methods research design, quantitative data were collected from students and faculty through an online bilingual survey followed by individual interviews for further exploration. The data analysis revealed that mismatches exist in teacher-student expectations and these dissimilar beliefs can influence student-teacher relationship. Five out of nine given items were found statistically significant between English faculty and Gulf and Non-Gulf Arab students where students had higher expectations about their responsibilities; however, Gulf Arab and Non-Gulf Arab student expectations differed only on three items. In addition to other practical suggestions for sharing and aligning divergent expectations, the study proposes employing a teacher-student learning contract to augment student and faculty cognizance of their academic and social obligations as well as assist the school administration in catering for their perspectives.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab student expectations|culture and expectations|faculty-student responsibility,2019-07-20T21:37:42.049224,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:37:24.331160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/citation/,6q7p3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bee1d45253a001c41c6dc/,5d2bee1d45253a001c41c6dc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6q7p3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6q7p3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6q7p3,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.24
