In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns before, during, and after the pandemic, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and its academic partner, Pennsylvania State University, have been working to conduct a study that can offer guidance to land managers, recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across the United States. Phase 1 of this assessment was conducted April 9th – 11th, 2020 (Rice et al., 2020). Phase 2 of this assessment was conducted April 30th – May 2nd. This second phase of research—discussed in this preliminary report— was designed to provide additional information regarding changes in recreation trends since April 9th, which provides valuable information for managing dynamic recreational use on public lands. In total, 823 outdoor recreationists were surveyed through the Leave No Trace community in a 48-hour window beginning on the morning of April 30th. The results of this second rapid assessment—complete with comparisons to Phase 1 data—will provide valuable information for managing the changing recreation use of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering insight for land managers as they work to protect the natural world.

The present study reveals huge amounts of household uncollected waste released into the natural environment outside the official statistics of rural dumpsites. Despite the expansion of waste collection coverage towards rural areas since 2010, the problem of illegal dumping practice is difficult to solve. The improvement of collection efficiency, better law enforcement, and surveillance of environmental authorities coupled with educational and environmental awareness are necessary steps to combat this bad practice.

Quantum mechanics is forced to introduce infinity implicitly by Hilbert space, on which is founded its formalism. One can demonstrate that essential properties of quantum information, entanglement, and quantum computer originate directly from infinity once it is involved in quantum mechanics. Thus, thеse phenomena can be elucidated as both complete and incomplete, after which choice is the border between them. A special kind of invariance to the axiom of choice shared by quantum mechanics is discussed to be involved that border between the completeness and incompleteness of infinity in a consistent way.

Although several scholars have questioned the authenticity of the information contained in the thug archive, that is, the corpus of colonial knowledge about the thugs, Martine van Wœrkens and Tihanyi (The strangled traveler: colonial imaginings and the thugs of India. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2002) and Macfie (Rethinking Hist 12 (3):383–397, 2008) argue that the very phenomenon as it was known to the British, was an orientalist construct. However, though the orientalist and romantic genesis of the thug imagery has been well established, the precise nature, reasons, and implications of the same largely remain “terra incognita”. This article examines the discovery of the thugs and analyzes parts of the thug-archive through the concept of the monster as elaborated by Mary Douglas (Purity and danger: an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo. Routledge, New York, 1966), Victor Turner (“Betwixt and between: the liminal period in rites de passage”. The forest of symbols. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1967) and Michel Foucault et al. (Abnormal:lecturesattheColleg̀edeFrance,1974–1975.Picador,NewYork,2003),and establishes the thug as an epistemological monster emerging from the cracks and gaps in colonial information gathering mechanisms that arose as a result of the changing nature of the Indian “state” and the employment of alien categories for demographic knowledge pro- duction. The key question here is: how can we explain the sudden appearance of thugs in the colonial archive in the 1830s and the disproportionate interest of the administration in era- dicating them? This article analyzes the journalistic and legal discourse surrounding the thugs in the nineteenth century and tries to demonstrate how the notion of the “monster” can act as a methodological tool in explaining the efforts of the Thug Department. The argument is then concluded through an investigation into the implications of the discovery of the thugs for the teleology of Indian history and the consequence of “othering” tribal and other anomic populations in the new Weberian state that the colonial and post-colonial regimes envisioned to establish.",TRUE,FALSE,colonial india|Demographic knowledge|thuggee,2020-05-05T13:58:44.042475,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-05T13:58:24.092093,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/citation/,dympk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb1262e69d3e10152de8a76/,5eb1262e69d3e10152de8a76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dympk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dympk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dympk,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-0458-8

The four-letter alphabet is sufficient to encode unambiguously any set of well-orderings including a geographical map or the “map” of any logic and thus that of all logics or the DNA (RNA) plan(s) of any (all) alive being(s).
Then the corresponding maximally generalizing conjecture would state: anything in the universe or mind can be encoded unambiguously by four letters.
That admits to be formulated as a “four-letter theorem”, and thus one can search for a properly mathematical proof of the statement.
It would imply the “four colour theorem”, the proof of which many philosophers and mathematicians believe not to be entirely satisfactory for it is not a “human proof”, but intermediated by computers unavoidably since the necessary calculations exceed the human capabilities fundamentally. It is furthermore rather unsatisfactory because it consists in enumerating and proving all cases one by one.
Sometimes, a more general theorem turns out to be much easier for proving including a general “human” method, and the particular and too difficult for proving theorem to be implied as a corollary in certain simple conditions.
The same approach will be followed as to the four colour theorem, i.e. to be deduced more or less trivially from the “four-letter theorem” if the latter is proved.

Anyway the “free will” can be distinguished from the “choice”: The “free will” involves implicitly certain preliminary goal, and the choice is only the mean, by which it can be achieved or not by the one who determines the goal. Thus, for example, an electron has always a choice but not free will unlike a human possessing both. Consequently, and paradoxically, the determinism of classical physics is more subjective and more anthropomorphic than the indeterminism of quantum mechanics for the former presupposes certain deterministic goal implicitly following the model of human freewill behavior.
The choice is usually linked to very complicated systems such as human brain or society and even often associated with consciousness. In its background, the material world is deterministic and absolutely devoid of choice. However, quantum mechanics introduces the choice in the fundament of physical world, in the only way, in which it can exist: All exists in the “phase transition” of the present between the uncertain future and the well-ordered past. Thus the present is forced to choose in order to be able to transform the coherent state of future into the well-ordering of past. The concept of choice as if suggests that there is one who chooses. However quantum mechanics involves a generalized case of choice, which can be called “subjectless”: There is certain choice, which originates from the transition of the future into the past. Thus that kind of choice is shared of all existing and does not need any subject: It can be considered as a low of nature.
There are a few theorems in quantum mechanics directly relevant to the topic: two of them are called “free will theorems” by their authors, Conway and Kochen, and according to them: “Do we really have free will, or, as a few determined folk maintain, is it all an illusion? We don’t know, but will prove in this paper that if indeed there exist any experimenters with a modicum of free will, then elementary particles must have their own share of this valuable commodity” “The import of the free will theorem is that it is not only current quantum theory, but the world itself that is non-deterministic, so that no future theory can return us to a clockwork universe”
Those theorems can be considered as a continuation of the so-called theorems about the absence of “hidden variables” in quantum mechanics.",TRUE,FALSE,choice|freewill|freewill theorem|hidden variables in quantum mechanics,2020-05-05T13:59:41.825454,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-05T13:59:32.704725,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/citation/,fm37u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb1109769d3e10140dedf8c/,5eb1109769d3e10140dedf8c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fm37u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fm37u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fm37u,NA
