of science correctly characterizes science, is examined in this paper through the lens of a related
debate, namely whether science is a social construct or not. The latter debate arose in response
to Kuhn’s work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, in which he argued that while there
exists a process through which scientific understanding evolves from primitive to increasingly
refined ideas, it does not describe progress ’toward’ anything. Kuhn’s work was then used to
argue that there is no such thing as a knowable objective reality, a view much in agreement
with that of the instrumentalist.
This paper argues that a generalized version of the correspondence principle applied to a theory’s
domain of validity is an exclusive feature of science which distinguishes it from socially
constructed phenomena and thereby supports the realist position. According to this argument,
progress in science can be characterized as the replacement of old paradigms by new ones with
greater domains of validity which obey the correspondence principle where the two paradigms
overlap. This characterization, however, is susceptible to the instrumentalist objection that it
does not fit the transition from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics. In response, it is required
that this argument depend on the intactness of certain core concepts in the face of experimental
challenge within some regions of the theory’s original domain of validity. While this requirement
saves the argument and even offers an answer to the question of what it would take for our most
established theories in physics, relativity and quantum theory, to suffer the same fate as Aristotelian
physics, it also defers a conclusive resolution to the debate between instrumentalists
and realists until it can be determined whether an ultimate theory of nature can be found.",TRUE,FALSE,Correspondence Principle|Domain of Validity|Instrumentalism|Operationalism|Philosophy of Science|Realism|Social Construction|Thomas Kuhn,2018-07-02T11:14:53.830554,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-05T17:39:41.633555,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,Armin Nikkhah Shirazi,2008,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/citation/,wz2cf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w7t9v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/relationships/node/,w7t9v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59d66cccb83f6902b1d73c95/,59d66cccb83f6902b1d73c95,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wz2cf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wz2cf,NA

Summary answer: The normative cultural acceptance of ART is a major driver of ART treatments in Europe, above and beyond differences in country wealth, demographic aspects, and religious composition.

What is known already: There are vast differences in the number of ART treatments across European countries, which are to some extent related to country affluence, regulation, and insurance coverage and costs. The role and impact of cultural and normative factors has not been explored in a larger cross-national comparison.

Study design, size, duration: A descriptive and comparative cross-national analysis of ART treatment prevalence in over 30 European countries in 2010, with the outcome defined as the total number of ART cycles per million women of reproductive age (15–44 years).  Data is drawn from multiple sources (ICMART, US Census Bureau Library, World Bank, Barro–Lee Educational Attainment Dataset, IFFS Surveillance reports, European Values Study, and World Religion Database).

Participants/materials, setting, methods: Our sample includes data from 35 European countries, where we describe the associations between demographic and cultural factors and the prevalence of ART treatments.  Bivariate correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression analysis serves to establish the relationships between predictor variables and the number of ART treatments per million women aged 15–44 years in a country.

Main results and the role of chance: A one-percent increase in national GDP is associated with 382 (95% CI: 177–587) additional ART procedures per million women of reproductive age, yet this effect is reduced to 99 (-92–290) treatments once cultural values are accounted for.  In our fully adjusted model, normative cultural values about the acceptability of ART are the strongest predictor of ART usage, with a one-point increase of average approval in a country associated with 276 (167–385) additional ART treatments per million women of reproductive age.

Limitations, reasons for caution: Findings are based on a cross-sectional, cross-national analysis, making formal tests of causality impossible and prohibiting inferences to the individual level.

Wider implications of the findings: Results indicate that reproductive health policy should openly acknowledge the importance of cultural norms in informally shaping and regulating the wider availability of ART treatment.",TRUE,FALSE,Assisted reproduction|Assisted Reproductive Technologies|Culture|Europe|In vitro fertilization|Religion,2018-07-02T11:14:53.790962,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-05T12:47:04.021285,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/citation/,tcj94,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q5h6x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/relationships/node/,q5h6x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59b035f4b83f69025183e4dd/,59b035f4b83f69025183e4dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tcj94/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tcj94,https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dex298

I wrote this in 2007 as a student trying to think about Blade Runner through both religious studies and anthropology. An updated version is in progress.

Excerpt:
""By threatening binary systems and insisting on an identity of plurality, replicants and cyborgs are granted access to a sanctuary in which they can interface with the numinous place of origin; the place Jenna Tiitsman describes as the chaotic “territory of creation.” The following analysis is a journey of exploration to map
the cyborg sanctuaries in that chaotic territory of Tiitsman’s “creative becoming.” This expedition will explore the web of shared conversation between discourse in three regions: investigation into human reactions to robot humanness, relational ordering of religious experience, and the capacity of cyborgs to access the numinous.

At the intersection of these cognitive spaces emergent from the “territory of creation” are conceptual-crossroads where cyborgs mediate access to the supernatural. To situate these emergent conceptual-crossroads within more familiar cognitive spaces with supernatural access, I will refer to them as the temples of cyborgism.""

Keywords: Blade Runner, cyborg, uncanny valley, numinous, creation, supernatural.

New communications technology, especially activists' widespread adoption of social media, calls into question whether these claims apply equally to online social media-based coalitions. Using the case of the Egyptian revolution in the Arab Spring, we conduct a series of social network analyses of the Twitter networks of activists. We find that social movements coalitions theory accurately predicts the conditions under which coalitions form and dissolve for online activists, as it does for on-the-ground activists. Among activists of diverse ideologies, we identify a pattern of solidarity in the early days of the revolutionary period, followed by a period of schism after a military crackdown on protestors.

To scrutinize this argument, I analyze longitudinal linked employer-employee data (N&gt;9.6 mio) and pursue a mechanistic three-step identification strategy: First, I illustrate how the introduction of the Euro distorted real interest and exchange rates within the Eurozone. Second, I demonstrate how these imbalances redistributed rents from the domestic sector, in particular from construction, to the core manufacturing industry. Third, I show how this shift in industry rents reverberated to the wage distribution and increased inequality.

Despite their protective attitude toward established theory, economists have traveled widely and gained new insights or asked new questions as a result of their exposition to “other” economic systems, ideas and forms of behavior. That is particularly the case when they travel to new places while their frameworks are in their initial stages or undergoing changes. This essay examines economists’ traveling as a potential source of new hypotheses, from the 18th to the 20th centuries, with a detailed case study of Douglass North’s 1961 travel to Brazil.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:14:52.509017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-03T20:19:31.713647,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Mauro Boianovsky,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/citation/,npzr2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g9rzv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/relationships/node/,g9rzv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59d3f00f6c613b02c48f8f6e/,59d3f00f6c613b02c48f8f6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npzr2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npzr2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npzr2,NA

I report from an ethnography of infrastructure in Wikipedia to discuss an often understudied aspect of this topic: the local, contextual, learned expertise involved in participating in a highly automated social–technical environment. Today, the organizational culture of Wikipedia is deeply intertwined with various data-driven algorithmic systems, which Wikipedians rely on to help manage and govern the “anyone can edit” encyclopedia at a massive scale. These bots, scripts, tools, plugins, and dashboards make Wikipedia more efficient for those who know how to work with them, but like all organizational culture, newcomers must learn them if they want to fully participate. I illustrate how cultural and organizational expertise is enacted around algorithmic agents by discussing two autoethnographic vignettes, which relate my personal experience as a veteran in Wikipedia. I present thick descriptions of how governance and gatekeeping practices are articulated through and in alignment with these automated infrastructures. Over the past 15 years, Wikipedian veterans and administrators have made specific decisions to support administrative and editorial workflows with automation in particular ways and not others. I use these cases of Wikipedia’s bot-supported bureaucracy to discuss several issues in the fields of critical algorithms studies; critical data studies; and fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning—most principally arguing that scholarship and practice must go beyond trying to “open up the black box” of such systems and also examine sociocultural processes like newcomer socialization.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithmic systems|algorithms|automation|bots|bureaucracy|context|critical data studies|data science|data science studies|digital divide|ethnography|expertise|infrastructure studies|newcomer socialization|online communities|open source|organizational culture|peer production|platforms|socialization|transparency|user-generated content|Web 2.0|Wikipedia,2018-07-02T11:14:51.438573,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-02T23:29:43.986620,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/citation/,u3kz6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/92vys/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/relationships/node/,92vys,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59d2ca0ab83f6902b005a1e4/,59d2ca0ab83f6902b005a1e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3kz6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u3kz6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u3kz6,https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951717730735

After developing some support for the claim that a surge of white, working-class voters emerged in competitive states in 2016, a portrait of class differences on political matters among white, non-Hispanic, eligible voters between 2004 and 2016 is offered to assess the electoral consequences of this surge. These latter results are consistent with the claim that racial prejudice, anti-immigrant sentiment, concerns about economic security, and frustration with government responsiveness may have led many white, working-class voters to support an outsider candidate who campaigned on these themes. However, these same results give no support to the related claim that the white working class changed its positions on these matters in response to the 2016 primary election campaign or in the months just before the general election.",TRUE,FALSE,class|current population survey|general social suvey|presidential election|voter turnout,2018-07-02T11:14:51.070782,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-02T17:35:39.318939,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/citation/,y3v56,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5fvy2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/relationships/node/,5fvy2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59d27793b83f69004566faa9/,59d27793b83f69004566faa9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3v56/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y3v56/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y3v56,https://doi.org/10.15195/v4.a27
