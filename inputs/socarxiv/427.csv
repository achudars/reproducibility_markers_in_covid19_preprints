Regardless of its significance, regions such as Ibero-America have been overlooked from exhaustive studies on bibliometrics in the subject of BMA. Here, a bibliometric outlook of the subject of BMA in Ibero-America was conducted by analyzing the ten most cited documents in BMA in each country from 1996 to 2017 using the citation database Scopus. The main findings showed: a rapid increase in documents’ production; both Spain and Portugal domain the overall documents’ production and citations; most of the documents are pay-walled; the most-desired journal in the region is also the most- suspicious; a Pareto distribution in both citations by documents and authors by documents; and institutional status has a significant effect on AACSB accreditation.",TRUE,FALSE,Accounting|Bibliometrics|Business|Ibero-America|Management,2019-01-11T12:45:01.427415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-11T12:44:37.815653,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics,Julián Cortés,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/citation/,cqa3z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mp9nq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/relationships/node/,mp9nq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c37dd3a7cf3f50019b502e4/,5c37dd3a7cf3f50019b502e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqa3z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cqa3z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cqa3z,NA

Income Inequality, Relative Deprivation, and Financial Satisfaction in U.S. States, 1973–2012","Many accounts posit that as income inequality rises, individuals will be less satisfied with their own financial situation as they feel increasingly deprived relative to others—driving these individuals to spend more as they engage in positional competition and increasing their anxieties as position in the income distribution becomes ever more important. I examine if and for whom income inequality reduces financial satisfaction by analyzing the 1973–2012 General Social Surveys linked to state-level administrative data based on tax returns, the Census, and the American Community Survey. I find that higher state-level income inequality decreases financial satisfaction overall, and I further find that this effect is especially pronounced for those in the middle of the income distribution.

Motivated reasoning means that any piece of new information will never weaken pre-existing beliefs; it is a form of confirmation bias. Conspiratorial epistemology occurs when information that contradicts pre-existing beliefs is automatically dismissed because it was allegedly manufactured by some conspiracy; evidence for that conspiracy and for the falsity of the dismissed information is not presented. Bullshit is a speach act with which the speaker aims to achieve only some instrumental goal; whether the uttered speech act is true or not is of no consequence to the speaker. Post-factual political discourse is a challenge for democracy because it erodes the epistemic dimension of democracy (thereby making it difficult, if not impossible to identify and solve societal problems) and because it erodes bridging social capital (thereby increasing polarization and tribalization).",TRUE,FALSE,bullshit|confirmation bias|conspiratorial epistemology|democracy|motivated reasoning|post-factual|post-truth|rationality,2019-01-11T12:40:41.769630,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-11T12:40:29.303205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf8|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Language|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/citation/,bnv2m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3762bf8047080018fae381/,5c3762bf8047080018fae381,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnv2m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bnv2m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bnv2m,NA

However, there is scarce empirical evidence, especially based on panel data, regarding these two hypotheses. In our analysis, we use up to ten waves of the “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS) German panel study and apply fixed effects panel regressions to account for unobserved confounders.

This paper investigates how underreporting affects estimates of the incidence and composition of poverty in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Specifically, I apply benefit adjustments for the underreporting of three social transfers to the Current Population Survey (CPS ASEC) to provide more accurate estimates of poverty rates. Diagnostic checks indicate that the imputed benefit adjustments are imperfect, but do provide a more accurate representation of household income than the uncorrected CPS ASEC data. In 2015, the benefit adjustments add more than $30 billion of income transfers to the CPS ASEC, primarily concentrated among low-income households with children. I test the effects of the benefit corrections on two conceptualizations of poverty: the U.S. Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and a relative measure of poverty set at 50 percent of federal median income. In 2015, the SPM poverty rate for the total population falls from 14.3 to 12.7 percent, a 1.6 percentage point (11 percent) decline, after adjusting for underreporting. Among children, the SPM poverty rate falls from 16.1 to 12.8 percent, a 3.3 percentage point (20 percent) decline. The percent-of-median poverty rate experiences similar declines after applying the benefit imputations. The findings suggest that the unadjusted CPS ASEC data meaningfully overestimates the incidence of poverty in the U.S., particularly among households with children. Documentation for applying the benefit corrections to the CPS ASEC is provided for improved estimates in future poverty research.",TRUE,FALSE,child poverty|CPS ASEC|income|measurement|poverty,2019-01-10T02:16:46.953088,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-10T02:16:29.982162,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/citation/,6vmws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c35c5a8804708001bf6c1dd/,5c35c5a8804708001bf6c1dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vmws/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vmws,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-018-02053-0
