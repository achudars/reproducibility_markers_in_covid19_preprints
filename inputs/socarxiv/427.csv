This paper promotes a place-based theoretical framework for studying crime perceptions through presenting app-based and crowdsourcing measures of perception of crime and place as a robust methodological framework. A systematic review of published studies that use crowdsourced or app-based measures to explore perceptions of crime was conducted. From the 27 studies that met our inclusion criteria, reported strengths and limitations were synthesized to determine key developments and common issues, illustrated with data from three app-based studies. We found consensus that app-based and crowdsourcing measures of fear of crime capture more precise spatial and temporal data alongside auxiliary information about the individual and the environment. Practical benefits, such as reduced cost of data collection and implementable outputs that are useful to practitioners were also highlighted. However, limitations around sampling biases, generalizability of findings, and the under-representation of certain areas persist.",TRUE,FALSE,app-based measures|crowdsourcing|environmental criminology|fear of crime|GIS|mapping|open data|perceived safety|safety|systematic review,2019-06-21T10:31:09.972571,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-21T10:30:49.856826,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/citation/,h3n9w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kmrwy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/relationships/node/,kmrwy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0c9a9411bd080017a3e2f6/,5d0c9a9411bd080017a3e2f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3n9w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h3n9w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h3n9w,NA

However, few archaeologists learn the skills necessary to conduct replication as part of their training. This means there is a gap between the ideals of archaeological science, and the skills we teach future researchers. Here we argue for replications as a core type of class assignment in archaeology courses to close this gap and establish a culture of replication and reproducibility. We review replication assignments in other fields, and describe how to implement a replication assignment suitable for many types of archaeology programs. We describe our experience with replication in an upper level undergraduate class on stone artefact analysis. Replication assignments can help archaeology programs give students skills that enable transparent and reproducible research.

However, it has also been shown that these presumptions must be considered important factors for the formation of journalistic coverage. Against this background, this article synthesizes existing research on dimensions, determinants, and consequences of journalists’ presumptions of media effects. The resulting framework offers researchers in the field of journalistic content production a comprehensive overview of the possible role that presumptions of media effects could play for journalistic content creation. In a second step, we summarize the implications that the current state of research points at.

Following the 2016 Stern Review and further rounds of technical consultation, the UK higher education community is now preparing for the next Research Excellence Framework – REF 2021.

Despite its importance in shaping UK research cultures, there is limited systematic and nuanced evidence about how academics across the sector view the REF, and which aspects are viewed favourably or unfavourably. The aims of this pilot study were twofold: first, it was designed to gather initial data to address this evidence gap; second, it was aimed at testing the feasibility of conducting a longitudinal study into academic and managerial attitudes towards the REF. We argue that further research to better understand the effects of the REF on research cultures, institutions, and individuals should be part of the evidence used to inform the development of future iterations of the exercise

This is probably one of the most frequently asked questions in the history of human kind. Moral decisions can be very hard in particularly when people are just starting their adventure with an adult life, that is, in their early 20’s. This report shows the moral condition of academic youth from one of the most religious regions in Poland. Therefore, the focus of this study was to show the relationship between religion and morality of young Poles. This article presents the results of a survey study conducted among 139 students of the University of Rzeszow attending the 2006/2007 academic year. The results showed that the morality of surveyed students seems to depend in a high degree on circumstances of situations (i.e., moderate moral relativism) rather than absolute norms. Moreover, the comparison of the results of this study with previous questionnaire research conducted at the same institution in mid-90’s show that religion has smaller impact on moral choices of academic youth from Subcarpathia province.

Prior research, from a range of contexts, has also yielded inconsistent results. We contribute to this debate by using harmonized data and methods to examine the effects of exposure to conflict on preferred and observed fertility outcomes across a spatially and temporally extensive population. We use high-resolution georeferenced data from 25 sub-Saharan African countries, combining records of violent events from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset with data on fertility goals and outcomes from the Demographic and Health Surveys (n=368,765 women aged 15-49 years). We estimate a series of linear and logistic regression models to assess the effects of exposure to conflict events on ideal family size and the probability of childbearing within the 12 months prior to the interview. We find that, on average, exposure to armed conflict leads to modest reductions in both respondents’ preferred family size and their probability of recent childbearing. Many of these effects are heterogeneous between demographic groups and across contexts, which suggests systematic differences in women’s vulnerability or preferred responses to armed conflict. Additional analyses suggest that conflict-related fertility declines may be driven by delays or reductions in marriage. These results contribute new evidence about the demographic effects of conflict and their underlying mechanisms, and broadly underline the importance of studying the many second-order effects of organized violence on vulnerable populations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-16T20:48:22.445693,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-16T20:47:54.288586,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",Brian Thiede|Matthew Hancock|Ahmed Kodouda|and James Piazza,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/citation/,4c9b2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d06a4007b8c4d001a9d04d9/,5d06a4007b8c4d001a9d04d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4c9b2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4c9b2,NA

However, the vast majority of research has only evaluated support for one form of natural resource use at a time. The little research that has explored support for a wide variety of uses has found that residents are likely to support many of the suggested forms of development. We assessed rural resident support for seven forms of natural resource development: commercial logging, natural gas, mining, real estate, wind energy, tourism, and outdoor recreation. Using social exchange theory, this study examines the influence of perceived impacts of development, industry trust, and perceived industry power on general support for the seven forms of natural resource-related economic development using a fixed effects generalized linear model among a sample of residents of rural Pennsylvania communities. Additionally, we use mixed logit discreet choice modeling to evaluate the drivers of relative support, meaning a stated preference for one form of development over other possible options. The drivers of general support and relative support were similar, with trust in industry and impacts to quality of life emerging as the primary drivers of both.",TRUE,FALSE,Environment and Natural Resources|Extraction|Leisure|Quantitative Methods|Recreation|Tourism,2019-06-15T20:21:02.037464,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-15T20:20:43.361696,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/citation/,h4f7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0520cba844d4001abce65c/,5d0520cba844d4001abce65c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4f7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h4f7g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h4f7g,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12293

To date, however, the drivers of these between-country patters in health inequalities remain largely unknown. In this analysis, we draw on data from 17 European countries to explore whether inequalities in political participation, that is, inequalities in voting by educational attainment, are correlated with health inequalities. Over and above a range of relevant confounders, such as GDP, income inequality, health spending, social protection spending, poverty rates, and smoking, greater inequalities in political participation remain correlated with higher health inequalities. If ‘politicians and officials are under no compulsion to pay much heed to classes and groups of citizens that do not vote’ then political inequalities could indirectly affect health through its impact on policy choices that determine who has access to the resources necessary for a healthy life. Inequalities in political participation, then, may well be one of the ‘causes of the causes’ of ill-health.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-15T20:15:31.753325,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-15T20:15:05.520155,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/citation/,5b2k3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d050d7b7b8c4d00199dcf58/,5d050d7b7b8c4d00199dcf58,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5b2k3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5b2k3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5b2k3,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112371

Combining insights from hermeneutic theories of the self and pragmatist theories of action, we develop a theoretical position that challenges dichotomous assumptions about whether motive accounts reflect either justifications or motivations for action, instead illustrating how they can migrate from one status to the other over time. We develop this perspective through a comparative
analysis of actors’ involvements in two quite different careers of social action – religion and mixed martial arts –documenting both how and when justificatory talk about actors’ motives for initiating a course of action at one point in time became formative of their subjective motivations for sustaining these same courses of action at another.",TRUE,FALSE,accounts|action|motivation|pragmatism|self|talk,2019-06-14T15:54:01.307622,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T15:50:46.936344,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/citation/,mykz7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d03b4337b8c4d00189bf674/,5d03b4337b8c4d00189bf674,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mykz7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mykz7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mykz7,NA
