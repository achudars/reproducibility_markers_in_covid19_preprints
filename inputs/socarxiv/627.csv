Data-driven decision-making consequential to individuals raises important questions of accountability and justice. Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering. We undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. Our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithmic accountability|algorithmic transparency|article 22|automated decision-making|credit scoring|explanation facilities|gdpr|procedural justice|right to an explanation|right to explanation,2018-07-02T11:37:25.762784,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-31T14:01:42.517204,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,ACM,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/citation/,9wqxr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xn75d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/relationships/node/,xn75d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a71a9ee9cd73200120a1055/,5a71a9ee9cd73200120a1055,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9wqxr/,https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173951,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9wqxr

Abstract: in the current investigation work, we will analyse the right to the energy supply, as a leading good to other improvements in decent housing, education, health, etc. We will also observe how is the impact of the supply in the different aspects of daily life in the communities and specially in their women. The case study will be developed into the frame of the international development cooperation, taking several projects of rural electrification in the South coordinated by develompent NGOs from the North. The analysis will make a panoramic and historical revision of the evolution of the international develompent cooperation and the different approaches from a gender perspective. Later on we will deepen the concept of Energy and the evolution of its consumption along the Human History, being specially aware of not skipping the fact that the use of women bodies as an energy resource is essential to mantain the current economical system. We are in the need of a different paradigma that questions the basis of Capitalism and Patriarchy, because here is where the hegemonic concepts are hold. Thus, we will propose an analysis framework with an Ecofeminist approach to obtain sustainability and we will use it to analyse the projects of rural electrification.

The critical Human Rights theory defines the rights as fighting processes that pursue an egalitarian access to material and immaterial goods. Taking this into account, the energy supply is understood as a material good that will lead to the obtention of other material and immaterial goods. Thus, the technology implemented in the communities for the energy supply will go together with a fighting process to get an egalitarian access, along with processes of social transformation. So, the technology installed must mean a real emancipation tool for the community and especially for women. This emancipation will depend on the process rather than on the transference as a simple  technological aim. This is why the development NGOs that work for the defense of the rights in this communities suppling them energy must go beyond a simpe technified approach. That means the need of focusing in the process, letting the community participate and reviewing the models of participation from a gender perspective. The goal must then be the satisfaction of the basic needs of the population and especially the real needs of women, because they have been hidden under gender roles. Besides, the implementation of technology cannot forget aspects as environmental, social and gender justice for the effective and real achievement of the desired sustainability.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperación internacional|decrecimiento|derechos humanos|desarrollo|ecofeminismos|ecología política|economía ecológica|Economía feminista|electrificación rural|género y energía,2018-07-02T11:37:22.653794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-29T20:42:55.593789,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/citation/,czvs8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g2vur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/relationships/node/,g2vur,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a6f202a2c4f20000ed02e0c/,5a6f202a2c4f20000ed02e0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/czvs8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/czvs8

In examining the potential of super-diversity as a methodological lens, I identify a risk of downplaying the effect of “old” categories of difference that are likely to continue to shape social structures as well as space. I propose a re-centering of power and inequality in the study of super-diversity by situating its study within an urban culturalist approach, with sociological tools borrowed from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism.

Unlike the wildly profitable Airbnb and Lyft, the Freecycle Network prohibits profit-making, or even barter, providing an altruism-based alternative to capitalist markets while keeping tons of garbage out of landfills. Why do millions of people give through Freecycle instead of selling, donating, or throwing away items? Utilizing participant observation of two overlapping Freecycle groups and a survey of their members, I investigate motivations for giving and the social norms that guide it. I find that while members of other internet-based groups have been found to exhibit altruism and solidarity, altruism and solidarity in Freecycle appear to be secondary.

Focusing on the German federal election campaign 2013, this article investigates whether election candidates address the topics most important to the mass audience and to which extent their communication is shaped by the characteristics of Facebook and Twitter. Based on open-ended responses from a representative survey conducted during the election campaign, we train a human-interpretable Bayesian language model to identify political topics. Applying the model to social media messages of candidates and their direct audiences, we find that both prioritize different topics than the mass audience. The analysis also shows that politicians use Facebook and Twitter for different purposes.

Declining Social Disparities in the Number of Siblings in 26 Countries,"One's number of siblings is an important determinant for many life outcomes such as educational attainment.  The US has experienced a 'sibsize revolution' in the last century, in which sibship sizes declined and which led to a convergence in family circumstances for children. Did this happen in other countries as well? This study examines the development of sibship size and social disparities in sibship size in low-fertility countries across the twentieth century. We analyze sibship size data collected from 111 nationally representative surveys conducted in 26 low-fertility countries across the twentieth century. Average sibship sizes have declined in virtually all countries.  Average sibship sizes are socially stratified, with smaller sibship sizes among higher-educated parents.  This social disparity in sibship size has declined over time, indicating convergence in most countries.  This convergence takes place for large families, but not for only-child families. Siblings are an understudied phenomenon in family demography, despite their growing importance in a time of increasingly complex family structures.  Given the significance of sibship size for children's educational outcomes and overall life chances, decreasing social disparities in sibship size suggest greater equality in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.",TRUE,FALSE,Demographic transition|Education|Fertility|Fertility rates|Siblings|Sibship size|Social demography,2018-07-02T11:36:48.269033,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-26T12:49:23.095574,NA,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WY3EG,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/citation/,zvb9c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wy3eg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/relationships/node/,wy3eg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a6b1ba43623a3000e639997/,5a6b1ba43623a3000e639997,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zvb9c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zvb9c/,https://doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2020.43.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zvb9c

First, I constructed a simple mathematical model which can explain the middle concentration tendency of class identification where the majority of people tend to regard themselves as middle, assuming that the succession of the same Bernoulli $m$-trials with success probability $p$ determines one's subjective class identification. Second, I estimated parameters of the model from SSM survey data by applying a Bayesian statistical model. The distribution of latent success probability $p$ and number of trials $m$ was estimated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. I also analyzed differences in distributions of $p$ and $m$ among age cohorts and educational levels by hierarchical models.

From the analysis, I found the following point: (1) approximately five trials of fifty-fifty games with around 0.5 success probability describes well the observed class identification distribution in 2015 data; (2) the Japanese postwar period can be divided in two based on people's subjective evaluations---the period of expanding opportunity (1955 to 1975) and the period of high and constant success probability, but less chance of trials (from 1985); and (3) the different games model on educational levels is always better in terms of goodness of predictions than the common game model in each survey period. However, these models were closest in terms of goodness of prediction in 1975 and 1985, possibly indicating that during the ``all middle-class society'' period, people evaluated their society almost the same as the common game where all players have the same opportunities, but diﬀerent luck.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian statistical modeling|class identification|random walk,2018-07-02T11:36:46.971530,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-25T20:07:22.468978,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/citation/,mv8pk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mf85q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/relationships/node/,mf85q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a69edb0630114000eb1371f/,5a69edb0630114000eb1371f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv8pk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mv8pk/,https://doi.org/10.11218/ojjams.33.261,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mv8pk
