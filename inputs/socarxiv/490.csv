Measures of entropy reveal a city’s streets’ order and disorder. Past studies have explored individual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader patterns and trends worldwide. This study examines street network orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100 cities around the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city’s typical street segment length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network’s proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order that quantifies how a city’s street network follows the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity. These indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the grid. These methods demonstrate automatic, scalable, reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order, illustrating complex urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|city|cluster|configuration|connectivity|data science|data visualization|entropy|geospatial|GIS|graph theory|grid|information visualization|network analysis|network science|OpenStreetMap|orientation|orthogonal grid|Python|spatial analysis|spatial logic|spatial order|street networks|streets|transportation|transportation planning|urban design|urban form|urban morphology|urban planning|urban science|urban studies,2018-08-02T13:37:01.501766,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-02T13:36:33.185995,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dec|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Transportation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/citation/,qj3p5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9p78/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/relationships/node/,y9p78,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6217b6fd63eb000d5b8ede/,5b6217b6fd63eb000d5b8ede,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3p5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qj3p5/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-019-0189-1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qj3p5

To estimate this missing counterfactual, we employ a new statistical method based on Bayesian item-response theory that permits us to disaggregate polarization after the Arab Uprisings into domestic and transnational components. We collected a dataset of Twitter accounts in Egypt and Tunisia during the critical year of 2013, when the Egyptian military overthrew the Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. We find that the coup increased retweets among Egyptian ideological allies by 50 percent each day following the coup and decreased cross-ideological retweets by 25 percent. Tunisian Twitter communities also showed stronger intra-group retweeting although at lower levels than in Egypt. Counter-intuitively, our model shows that the additional polarization  in Tunisia after the coup appears to have dampened   further polarization among Islamists in Egypt.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab Spring|computational social science|data science|Item-response theory|methodology|Middle East|polarization|statistics|Twitter,2018-08-01T20:31:01.736293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-01T20:30:51.545447,NA,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/saudiwin/arab_polarization,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/citation/,wykmj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wgfp5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/relationships/node/,wgfp5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b62131cbaf092000ffe4296/,5b62131cbaf092000ffe4296,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wykmj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wykmj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wykmj

Based on this as a main structure of the theory, Lefebvre’s periodization of space – aimed at the tracing the spaces being produced during each mode of production – is discussed. In the paper, the spatial triad aiming at understanding and conceptualization of social space is discussed as well. Thus, for any study of space in different contexts, an easily adaptable and applicable structural and conceptual framework of Lefebvre’s theory is presented.

I argue that the lesson learned from this literature is threefold: (1) educational institutions in practice significantly distort the ideal meritocratic process; (2) opportunities for merit are themselves determined by non-meritocratic factors; (3) any definition of merit must favor some groups in society while putting others at a disadvantage. Taken together, these conclusions give reason to understand meritocracy not just as an unfulfilled promise, but as an unfulfillable promise. Having problematized meritocracy as an ideal worth striving for, I argue that the pervasiveness of meritocratic policies in education threatens to crowd out as principles of justice, need and equality. As such, it may pose a barrier rather than a route to equality of opportunity. Furthermore, meritocratic discourse legitimates societal inequalities as justly deserved such as when misfortune is understood as personal failure. The paper concludes by setting a research agenda that asks how citizens come to hold meritocratic beliefs; addresses the persistence of (unintended) meritocratic imperfections in schools; analyzes the construction of a legitimizing discourse in educational policy; and investigates how education selects and labels winners and losers.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|education|inequality|legitimation|meritocracy|morality|politics,2018-08-01T16:22:25.099157,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-01T16:22:05.543302,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/citation/,6w9rg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c9nuw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/relationships/node/,c9nuw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4f5f9e33f0b9000cbaf320/,5b4f5f9e33f0b9000cbaf320,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6w9rg/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-014-0228-0,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6w9rg

To the surprise of many, empirical studies often found minimal effects. The predominant focus of early work was on U.S. elections, though. Nazi propaganda as the archetypal and, in many ways, most likely case for strong effects has rarely been studied. We collect extensive data about Hitler’s speeches and gauge their impact on voter support at five national elections preceding the dictatorship. We use a semi-parametric difference-in-differences approach to estimate effects in the face of potential confounding due to the deliberate scheduling of events. Our findings suggest that Hitler’s speeches, while rationally targeted, had a negligible impact on the Nazis’ electoral fortunes. Only the 1932 presidential runoff, an election preceded by an extraordinarily short, intense and one-sided campaign, yielded positive effects.

Although broad genre classifications such as ""ballad"", ""folktale"", ""legend"", ""proverb"", and ""riddle"" are well established and widely accepted, these formal classifications are coarse and do little more than provide a first level sort on materials for collections that can easily include tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of records. Many large collections of folklore have been classified using systems designed for very specific tasks, usually related to early theories about the spread of folk narrative. Beyond the straightforward parsing of folk expressions into easily recognized formal genres (e.g. ballad, riddle, joke, legend, fairytale, etc.), the overarching emphasis of these schemas is on topic indexing. Perhaps best known of these indices is the ATU index of fairy tales, designed to assist scholars who are interested in the comparison of fairy tales from one or more cultures. Another well-known index, the motif index of folk literature compiled by Stith Thompson (1955-58), is designed to assist scholars in discovering the relationships between complete narratives and their component parts, as well as the movement of motifs across time and space, where the motif is conceptualized as ""the smallest element in a tale having a power to persist in tradition."" Other genre specific classification schemes include the Migratory Legend [ML] catalog and Danmarks gamle Folkeviser [DgF]. More collection specific indices include the Child Ballads and, of particular interest to this study, the typological indices to the Danish folklore collector Evald Tang Kristensen's legend collections.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-01T14:27:01.517654,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-01T14:26:37.346799,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/citation/,a7dp8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/24xns/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/relationships/node/,24xns,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b60dde5fd63eb000f59fd04/,5b60dde5fd63eb000f59fd04,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7dp8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a7dp8/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.012,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a7dp8

Yet sociologists have not asked how we understand those sonic events as musical in the first place. Through nine months of semi-structured observations in six elementary school music classrooms, I examine how music education draws symbolic boundaries around musical sound. I find that variations in curriculum produce different organizational practices in the classroom. These practices develop what is a basic sensory skill – listening – in very different ways. I identify four dimensions of teacher performance that support these differences: authorized sound-makers, constrained movement, enforced perspectives, and selected attention.

Much of that abuse occurs behind closed doors inside the home where there are no witnesses. Because Florida law does not allow a person to record communications without the consent of everyone else involved, victims are forced to rely on uncorroborated verbal accusations when they report their abuse. 

Unfortunately, it is difficult to prosecute these cases because they turn into credibility contests where the abuser often has an unfair advantage and has learned how to manipulate the system. If the abuse was serious enough, the victim can rely on visible physical injuries to support her allegations. That is also problematic because it forces victims to use their bodies as evidence when far more effective substitutes are available.

This Note demonstrates that, although we claim domestic violence is no longer a private matter, we are effectively keeping it hidden behind closed doors by refusing to let victims record their abuse and then making it exceedingly difficult to prove their allegations without corroboration. The abuser’s right to privacy has become a priority over the victim’s safety. This Note argues that domestic violence victims need the ability to record the abuse they suffer inside the homes they share with their abusers. Finally, this Note proposes a statutory amendment to Florida’s all-party consent law that would achieve this goal.",TRUE,FALSE,all-party consent|domestic violence|eavesdropping|florida communications|florida surveillance|recording conversations,2018-08-01T14:24:21.445108,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-01T14:23:48.305452,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c17|Law|Evidence|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c78|Law|Communications Law,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/citation/,79n83,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6uygh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/relationships/node/,6uygh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b5ffd13fd63eb000e5939c1/,5b5ffd13fd63eb000e5939c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79n83/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/79n83/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/79n83

NYCEDC (New York City Economic Development Corporation) recently is implementing a program “UrbanTech NYC” to support entrepreneurs and innovators to help them find solutions for challenging problems in sectors of energy, transportation, water, waste, and agriculture in the city. UrbanTech NYC provides shared spaces and resources, equipment, pilot opportunities, prototyping, and learning opportunities to let these entrepreneurs and innovators being innovative in smart technologies. They provide two hubs, one in Manhattan, and one in Brooklyn with over 100,000 square feet of affordable and flexible space along with prototyping and piloting equipment. 
The paper also identifies three other policy options that New York City can adopt and implement instead of the current policy option. They briefly include maintaining the status que, providing tax incentives to big established well-known companies, and investing in implementation and provisions of smart infrastructure to attract entrepreneurs and firms to create a smart industry cluster in the city. Each of these policy options have positive and negative aspects that will be discussed in details through the paper. In addition, this paper provides an evaluation of the current policy option accompanying by alternative policy options.
The paper will be concluded that the preferred policy is the current policy. The current policy, “UrbanTech NYC”, is a novel platform for new entrepreneurs and innovators that aligns with other simultaneous policies and programs in New York that together they can be successful in their goals.
