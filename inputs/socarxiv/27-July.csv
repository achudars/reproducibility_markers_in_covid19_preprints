In fact, many prominent theoretical models of government debt accumulation -- often used to justify fiscal rules and austerity measures -- make explicit assumptions that individuals will have different preferences for debt reduction as they age. While such models have been influential, the fundamental assumption regarding the relationship between age and preferences for growing debt has not been test empirically. Using a decade's worth of data from the Eurobarometer survey across 33 countries, we find that age has a modest, non-linear impact on concern for national debt burdens. In general, the middle-aged show the most concern for debt reduction, while the young and the old are less likely to view reducing government debt as a policy priority.

In addition, this book is intended to complete Pancasila as the permanent foundation of the state for the Indonesian nation. This book is presented so that the Indonesian people, especially the millennial generation, can continue the life of the Indonesian people per the precepts of the Pancasila and apply life with Pancasila values as the basis of the Indonesian state. This book was also prepared with the aim of anticipating several phenomena and new ideologies that has entered Indonesia that are incompatible with the Pancasila Ideology after the Reformation Era. Pancasila as the foundation of a complete state should not be forgotten. The current millennial generation is more interested in ideologies from foreign countries that are not following the basis of our country, so this is an important reminder for the millennial generation of the impacts of these foreign ideologies. This book also contains a lot about the 1945 Constitution which hopes that the Indonesian people remember the regulations in it and do not conflict with these regulations.
	Book Pancasila Dasar Negara Paripurna is aimed at all Indonesian people, especially the millennial generation, who are the generation that will preserve the values of Pancasila. Due to the development of the times, the millennial generation has forgotten the Pancasila ideology as the basis of the Indonesian state. Pancasila now seems to be only a small part of the history of the Indonesian nation because many people do not follow the values of Pancasila and choose other ideologies. In democratic and political life, many people today make Pancasila the fault of all the problems and failures of national and state life. If Pancasila is interpreted and implemented correctly, Pancasila is a solution to the problems and failure of the state in carrying out Indonesian constitutionality.
	Information about the importance of Pancasila in state, social and national life is presented in a very complete manner. Pancasila is the basis of the state which still cannot be changed or replaced by other ideologies. Apart from being irreversible, Pancasila is the right ideology for Indonesia because the values in Pancasila reflect the customs and culture of the Indonesian people. Pancasila is suitable for a pluralistic society. Indonesia consists of islands that vary from Sabang to Merauke. From these islands, there are significant differences. However, the existence of Pancasila makes it easier for the Indonesian nation to unite and respect each other's differences. In addition, Pancasila is considered the right ideology because Pancasila is the basis for Indonesian society to solve state problems. Pancasila also has high values of democracy and justice, therefore a democratic society that values of human rights can be implemented more easily.
	The book has many benefits and this review is important. This is because the millennial generation today are increasingly contradicting and forgetting the Pancasila ideology. This book is presented with relevant purposes to overcome the problems of state, national and social life in this era of development. The noble values of Pancasila, which have been forgotten and lost from state life, are beginning to require the revitalization and actualization of Pancasila to be achieved as well as possible. All Indonesian people and millennial generation need to know and interpret Pancasila properly from an early age so that they can continue their constitutional life following the country's foundation, the nation's outlook on life, and the complete national personality.",TRUE,FALSE,Book|Millenial Generation|Pancasila,2021-06-11T09:22:21.991490,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-11T08:35:19.497241,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,NA,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/citation/,dsx5y,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c0954118f70b0072a782b0/,60c0954118f70b0072a782b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsx5y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dsx5y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dsx5y

Sie stellen heute eine wichtige infrastrukturelle Voraussetzung für viele medizinische Anwendungen und einen wesentlichen Motor biowissen-schaftlicher Innovationen dar. Zudem eröffnen sie Optionen für individuelle Reproduktionsentscheidungen, ebenso wie für den Erhalt der globalen Biodiversität. Unter der Leitung von Prof. Dr. Thomas Lemke nimmt das Forschungsprojekt CRYOSOCIETIES die Sammlung, Lagerung und Nutzung menschlicher und nicht-menschlicher organischer Materie durch kryobiologische Verfahren aus einer sozialwissenschaftlichen Perspektive in den Blick.
Kryotechnologien rücken in den Fokus gesellschaftswissenschaftlicher Forschung, weil sie grundlegende Normen und Wahrheitsansprüche verschieben. Gleichzeitig steht ihre Anwendung als solche immer im Kontext bestimmter Zukunftsvisionen, Forschungsnetzwerke und Allianzen. Die Untersuchung von Kryokonservierungs-praktiken ist somit auch wichtig, um zu verstehen, was heutige Innovationsregime ausmacht und wie ökonomische, politische und epistemische Agenden die Zukunft technologischer Eingriffe in Lebenszyklen prägen.
Dieser Beitrag ordnet diese Erkenntnisinteressen in die Tradition sozialwissenschaftlicher Erforschung von Wissensproduktion und Technologienutzung und ‐entwicklung ein und skizziert die Potentiale einer solchen Perspektive. Insbesondere werden auch die Besonderheiten eines Studiendesigns diskutiert, das auf unmittel-baren Interaktionen zwischen Sozialwissenschaftler*innen und den Akteur*innen in ihren Forschungsfeldern gründet. Ferner werden die drei Teilprojekte vorgestellt, die dieses empirische Programm in verschiedenen europäischen Staaten und Anwendungsbereichen realisieren.
Die Fallstudien beschäftigen sich mit Nabelschnurblutlagerung, Eizelllagerung und der Kryokonservierung von tierischem Material zum Erhalt der Biodiversität. Dabei stehen jeweils unterschiedliche Forschungsinteressen und -fragen im Mittelpunkt. Sie reichen von Themen, wie Beschäftigungsverhältnissen und Familienplanung über die Verschränkung von Gesundheitsversorgung und Marktstrukturen bis hin zu Mensch-Umwelt-Beziehungen.
Über diese diversen Felder und Fragestellungen hinweg wird im Rahmen von CRYOSOCIETIES analysiert, wie durch Kryokonservierung neue Zeithorizonte entstehen und wie kryokonservierte Bestände gepflegt, erweitert, verändert und in ihrem Status und Wert verhandelt werden.

Technological Concerns and Legal Implications,"Artificial intelligence (“AI”) has advanced to the point that machines can compare and contrast historical cases in order to predict the outcome of a dispute at hand. AI studies that predict the outcome of litigation have stirred heated debate about the possible arrival of AI judges. Few scientific and legal studies have investigated the prediction of legal decision-making in arbitration despite the fact of AI predicting case outcomes and the emerging talk of AI judges. Inspired by these debates and to fill this gap in legal scholarship, the article poses the question of whether AI will be able to replace arbitrators, enquires into AI’s ability to predict outcomes of future cases in the context of international commercial arbitration, and scouts the potential implications if AI does, in fact, replace arbitrators.

As a result, this research struggles to make sense of the finding that immigration policies are frequently inconsistent: combining or alternating between restrictive and non-restrictive measures. This study uses global data sets to reveal what proportion of immigration policies are inconsistent and develops a measure of policy inconsistency to track how immigration policy inconsistency varies across time. We use these techniques to generate limited empirical support for macro-political explanations of policy inconsistency, which focus on variables located at the national scale such as policy-cycles, ‘grand bargains’ between advocacy coalitions, and policy-maker selectivity. We then use these findings of the limited support for macro-political explanations to argue in favour of further research into micro-political explanations, which focus on the behaviour of ordinary officials and migrants at the local scale.

By showing these two things, readers can have a broad understanding of the Indonesian women's movement.
This book is intended for the millennial generation so that they know how the Indonesian women's movement is. Why is that? Because this book deliberately took a very long period of time, namely in the span of seventy years (1928-1998). So that readers, especially the millennial generation, can imagine what happened at that time.
History writing about the Indonesian women's movement has been done by many scientists, but in the book ""History of Indonesian Women's Organization (1928-1998)"" has a difference, namely using detailed references to reliable sources and coverage of a very long historical period. In addition, this book provides information on how the priority of the issues under debate reflected the political context in different historical periods.
This book needs to be reviewed because the content in the book is very interesting so that it can be dissected in depth.

But there is human intervention in it, which results from the system social-economic currently prevailing it is capitalism. Therefore in this book, the author provides a solution, namely communism, to overcome the pandemic and anticipate the arrival of a brutal society that the author predicted will emerge after the pandemic ends.
This book will be very appropriate to be read by a philosopher or intellectual. The solutions offered in the book can be used as a reference or material for consideration. But it does not rule out the possibility to be read by anyone because it is equipped with intellectual humor that can make us aware. Still, according to my the language used will be difficult for ordinary people to implement.
Communism has proven to successfully deal with a pandemic established by China that can handle pandemics well. The number of positive cases of Covid-19 has decreased. Even when positive cases of Covid-19 in other countries have increased, China has opened a lockdown policy for its people in several cities. Of course, this is good news for everyone. Thus, the authors indicate that in some aspects, China is the future for the whole world.
The reason why the writer of the recession chose the first book entitled ""Pandemic Panik!: Covid-19 Mengguncang Dunia"" is a book following the provisions and themes given by a lecturer who teaches philosophy of science. Second, this book is relevant to the current situation. The whole world faces a global pandemic caused by the Covid-19 virus and requires the right solution to overcome it.
