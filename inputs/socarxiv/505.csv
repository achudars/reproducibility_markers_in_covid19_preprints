This paper aims to contribute to our knowledge about reading in this region by studying the motivation and habits of recreational reading of university educated youth in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It specifically aims to answer the questions: what are the recreational reading frequency, and the type and language of the reading material? Which personal characteristics correlate with recreational reading habits? And which factors impact the motivation to read? The findings are based on a survey of 775 undergraduate students at UAE University. The survey questionnaire included an adult reading motivation scale developed by Schutte and Malouff (2007) which was modified after assessing its goodness-of-fit to the UAE context using confirmatory factor analysis. Pearson’s chi-square test, Poisson regression and ANOVA were used to identify the correlates of reading habits and compare motivation scores across demographic groups. Seventy-one percent of the students read at least one book for pleasure in the last six months and they read, on average, for 2.3 hours per week. Reading frequency depends on gender, the student’s secondary education, and the parents’ education. Gender, parents’ education have significant effects on the motivation scores and the preferred language of reading (p-value &lt; 0.01). Students read more during the academic year than in the vacation.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab region|motivation to read|reading for pleasure|reading habits|the United Arab Emirates Introduction,2019-01-05T04:50:23.946802,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:49:11.475191,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/citation/,3enpw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2bf29d28af78001968cb8c/,5c2bf29d28af78001968cb8c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3enpw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3enpw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3enpw

Advancement in telecommunication and information technology has resulted in a tremendous impact on teaching and learning. Accordingly, university education has started to benefit from online learning platforms. The revolutionary progress that the internet has known is giving a modern dimension to the teaching process, thus, facilitating university students' learning. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which Facebook can be an effective means to distribute academic content to university students. Department of English of Mostaganem University is involved in this study. The Study combines quantitative with qualitative types of research. Quantitate research involves distributing a survey in the form of a questionnaire among License 2 students department of English as well as teachers to examine to what extent Facebook can be used for academic purposes. Qualitative research is dedicated to the analysis and observation of studens’ Facebook group page. The results showed that Students confirm that Facebook is a useful tool to distribute and share academic knowledge yet there are still many obstacles that hinder its use at the university context. On another hand, the present research suggests some helping solutions to enhance Facebook educational use among university students and their teachers.

More specifically yet, it is concerned with examining the intricate correlation between Moroccan English Language Teachers’ (ELT) attitudes and practices with respect to the way they understand and apply FA by means of WCF on students’ written productions. To that end, the study seeks to investigate this issue in the light of the following guiding questions: What beliefs do Moroccan ELT teachers hold about FA and WCF? How do these teachers provide WCF to their students during the writing lesson? To address these questions, we have opted for a mixed method approach that includes questionnaires for 110 teachers, document analysis of 30 writing productions and a follow- up semi-structured interviews with teachers. Date has been interpreted through an Explanatory Sequential Design. Inspired by Lee‘s (2009) analytical model and Perumanathan (2014) study, major findings have been presented regarding mismatches.

With the recent increase in the influx of foreign students gaining admission into Thai universities yearly, the result is that such universities will be a coexistence of cultures. This study therefore aims to investigate the situational face-threat contexts where Thai students use silence as a politeness strategy. This aim is guided by the main research question of what different situational face-threat contexts could lead to the use of silence by Thai students in their foreign-peer interactions in a Thai multicultural university context. Twenty students’ interactions were sampled using micro-socio-ethnographic technique, with data from observation, interview, and questionnaire. The main findings revealed that: uncertainty of language proficiency, expected hurting words from interlocutor, and unexpected negative change in hearer’s mood, amongst others, were the main circumstances where Thai students use silence as a face-saving politeness strategy.

The study focuses on comparative methods of studying different training programs in order to set out the results of a success study of different students groups. The authors substantiated the necessity of using the basic methodology of teaching a foreign language for special purposes with a higher efficiency of the personality-oriented approach as a basis for teaching ESP. The results of the research proved that the development of the program depends on the analysis of the needs of the learning group and the actual situations of using the language for special purposes. For teaching the EGP course, students have a common standard goal of learning English, which does not always correspond to the language needs of the students. The line of demarcation between the courses of EGP and ESP has become very important, but requires the further discussion.

The Arabic version of the questionnaire has been administered and 118 Saudi EFL learners from a Saudi university returned the questionnaire. The research questions set for this survey include what beliefs Saudi EFL learners have towards the difficulty of foreign language learning, foreign language aptitude, the nature of language learning, learning and communication strategies and motivation and expectations for English language learning. The results reveal that the participants bear high English language learning aptitude and believe that it is easier to learn it in childhood. No strong relationship in learning subjects like science and math and English language was reported.

In addition, it aims to provide explanations of these prominent differences between the two participating groups. Hinkel’s (1997) Multiple Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) is used as a data collection instrument. The questionnaire is translated into Arabic to ensure that participants truly comprehend the situations. Results demonstrate that there are differences between the two participating groups. For example, Jordanian male students favour to give advice indirectly more than using hedge advice, direct advice and opting out in both peer acquaintance and instructor situations. On the other hand, Jordanian female students prefer to use hedge advice in responding to both peer acquaintance and instructor situations more frequently than using direct advice, indirect advice and opting out.

The power we enjoy as social actors or the ideology we adhere to concerning any issue in life may play a crucial role in our language production or interpretation. Issuing a certain speech act rather than another or producing one impolite form rather than a polite one owning to such aspects falls within the realm of critical pragmatics. It is one analytical methodology where critical issues are examined in terms of the pragmatic phenomena to explore how the latter aid in the manifestation of the former. It attempts to answer this question: what are the most common pragmatic phenomena that reveal how racists or sexists pass on their critical ideologies? It aims to develop an analytical model for critical pragmatics and identify the common pragmatic themes utilized. The study is qualitative. It confines itself to the political discourse in the American context. The analysis of the data proves the workability of the model that has been developed by the study. It also shows that various pragmatic phenomena can be utilized to unravel critical issues.",TRUE,FALSE,critical pragmatics|pragmatics|racism|sexism,2019-01-05T04:47:01.403520,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:46:35.307049,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/citation/,nsyx4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2be8d1a7c0a700193c750b/,5c2be8d1a7c0a700193c750b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nsyx4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nsyx4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nsyx4

This study juxtaposes eight categories of Arabic-to-English transfer errors with equivalent and near-equivalent errors in Arabic. It compares their error gravity as rated by teachers and students to discover whether there are any differences between teacher and student perceptions that might inform teaching practices. It is also the first step toward a cross-linguistic theory of comparative error gravity based on the functional equivalence approach to translation. It finds that teachers tend to perceive grammatical errors as graver than mechanical or lexical errors, with most differences in perception appearing to stem from cultural background. Among students, there is very little consensus, in line with previous studies. This study concludes that teachers and students might benefit from a better understanding of both their own tendencies in perceiving errors and those of the other party in the learning process. It also recommends the development of a full-fledged theory for moving between languages for the purpose of studying error gravity comparatively in languages other than Arabic.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic|comparative linguistics|English language teaching|error gravity|ESL/EFL,2019-01-05T04:46:46.670325,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T04:46:18.917544,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/citation/,mgfh4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2be80c0e8efd0016cd437c/,5c2be80c0e8efd0016cd437c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgfh4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mgfh4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mgfh4
