The condition of low reading interest among students has been a major issue that needs a creative follow-up from scholars, teachers and practitioners. This study aims to explore the development of students’ reading interest in relation to their participation in independent reading-retelling activity as part of independent learning activity in a particular course they took. Seventy-five students from Faculty and Teacher Training Education of Universitas Lambung Mangkurat, Indonesia, were involved as the participants in this study. The students took part in independent reading-retelling activity which requires them to read novels and short stories and retell it to as well as do sharing session to discuss the stories with their partners. This activity was done out of course schedule and complemented with a journal entry to track the students’ progress. Without the purpose of assessing the students, the activity was intended to give students meaningful reading experience and to grow their reading interest. The encouragement of the lecturer was regularly given to the students to keep up their reading and retelling. A questionnaire was used to collect data on their reading interest and their perception on the influence they feel from the activity. This study showed that the students’ reading interest was at medium level with several positive reading behaviors. From the students’ perception, the activity has given them positive influence on their vocabulary growth, reading comprehension, self-quality development, and reading interest.",TRUE,FALSE,independent reading|reading|reading interest|retelling activity,2018-07-02T11:57:41.659296,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:40:00.543092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/citation/,avrtf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2axst/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/relationships/node/,2axst,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dd560d65eaa0010d9e71b/,5b2dd560d65eaa0010d9e71b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avrtf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/avrtf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/avrtf

To determine whether to support the TTT in the future, KAU wanted to identify how well its TTT graduates could provide professional development to their colleagues. This study’s aim is to discuss how positively those who were involved in the TTT, particularly the  administration, the TTT graduate trainers themselves, and the other teachers who attended the workshops presented by first-year graduates of the ELI’s TTT responded to the course. The main question it addresses is how successful the implementation of such a TTT course can be at the English language institute of a Saudi university, like at KAU, so as to determine if the TTT should continue to be offered at KAU and more generally, taking the example of the ELI at KAU, if the TTT course should also be proposed at other English language institutes in Saudi Arabia. This study employed a Likert scale survey, semi-structured interviews, and open-ended questions with TTT participants, administrators, and other faculty to assess the TTT’s initial value. The main finding of this study is that so far, the TTT course was perceived as beneficial. However, future analyses should evaluate the longer-term effects of the TTT on teaching approaches and student learning.",TRUE,FALSE,effectiveness of Cambridge Train the Trainer course|EFL|EFL professional development|EFL Saudi context|teacher-trainers,2018-07-02T11:57:41.618982,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:40:17.094982,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/citation/,3fexk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x5k8d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/relationships/node/,x5k8d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dd435daf8210012d537e2/,5b2dd435daf8210012d537e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fexk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3fexk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3fexk

It tries to answer the following question : Are there statistically important differences at (α ≤ 0.05) in the whole mean scores in vocabulary accomplishment among the students who learn English vocabulary through using ECRIF strategy (experimental group) and those who learn English vocabulary over the traditional technique (control group) in the post test? To accomplish the purpose of the study, the researcher shown the experimental group with a sample involved (125) students for ECRIF strategy. While the traditional technique was used with the control group which involved (100) students in the first term of the school year 2017-2018.The researcher used (pre -post &amp; delayed) vocabulary test and an analysis card to collect data. The study's results suggested that there were statistically important differences at (α ≤ 0.05) in the whole mean grade in vocabulary accomplishment between experimental and the control groups in the post &amp; delayed test in favor of ECRIF strategy. In addition, the researcher recognized these differences to using ECRIF strategy in teaching English language vocabulary. In light of these outcomes, the study suggested the necessity of applying ECRIF in teaching English language to get better results in students’ vocabulary learning and retention in English as a foreign language. Similarly, the ECRIF Strategy would be used with other English skills and sub-skills.",TRUE,FALSE,ECRIF|EFL|learning.|retention|seventh grade|vocabulary,2018-07-02T11:57:41.569312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:40:38.548242,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/citation/,gs23c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g2spk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/relationships/node/,g2spk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dd37adaf8210013d3f2af/,5b2dd37adaf8210013d3f2af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gs23c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gs23c/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gs23c

The researcher attempts to highlight the most important theoretical frameworks on identity, ideologies, and language, and discusses key theoretical frameworks that have had an influence among recent scholars’ empirical work especially in the fields of second language acquisition (SLA), sociolinguistics, and linguistic anthropology. This article has two objectives. First, with a focus on the relationship between language, identity, and investment, the researcher attempts to present a review of Norton’s foundational work dated between 1995 (Peirce, 1995) to a more recent scholarly work (Darvin &amp; Norton, 2015). Next, she discusses identity and interaction from a sociocultural linguistic approach by drawing on Bucholtz and Hall’s framework (2004a, 2004b, 2005). Findings from this article highlight a paradigm shift in the ways the scholarly focus has changed from looking at language solely as an oral and written skill to looking at language from the sociocultural lens and studying how it is embedded in identity production through linguistics interaction. This article concludes with a recommendation for future research on identity and language to respond to the diversity of language practices and aim at connecting language ideologies and identity to enhance our understanding of today’s complex learning communities and globalized world.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|investment|language learning|linguistic capital|social identity,2018-07-02T11:57:41.524135,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-23T17:41:02.277331,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/citation/,542m7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p8et6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/relationships/node/,p8et6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2dd2c3d65eaa000edb51cd/,5b2dd2c3d65eaa000edb51cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/542m7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/542m7/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no2.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/542m7

The research participants were 46 Arabic-speaking young adult EFL learners. They were asked to read a modified text containing 10 pseudo-word collocations and to verify that all were unfamiliar to them. One week later, they read a text containing the actual 21 target collocations, which had been selected on the basis of appearing in instructional materials and a reference corpus, as well as of frequency. Participants were then asked to complete a meaning-recall cloze test in the form of a gap-filling task in which the 21 target collocations were embedded in sentences. Subsequently they were administered a self-report survey about any incidental exposure to English. The analysis of the quantitative results revealed that the target collocations can be learned incidentally through reading although the level of mastery was limited. The survey data showed a positive correlation between the learners’ knowledge of collocations and activities such as watching TV, listening to radio and reading English books.

Webb collection, which resulted in the identification of two discrete shapes used in the manufacture of the base and body of Smithport Plain bottles. The sample includes the Smithport Plain bottles from the Webb collection, and four new bottles: two previously repatriated specimens in the Pohler Collection, and two from the Mitchell site (41BW4) to test whether those specimens align morphologically with the Belcher Mound or Smithport Landing specimens. Results indicate significant allometry and a significant difference in Smithport Plain body and base shapes for bottles produced at the Smithport Landing and Belcher Mound sites in northwest Louisiana. The Pohler and Mitchell specimens do not differ significantly from those found at Smithport Landing or Belcher Mound. Analysis of the aggregated sample indicates some significant relationships between bottle shape and size, bottle shape and type, and bottle shape and site, highlighting assemblage-level and type-specific variability. The test of morphological disparity by period indicates a possible gradual trend toward standardization, and the test of morphological integration indicates that Caddo bottles are significantly integrated, meaning that those discrete traits used to characterize their shape (rim, neck, body, and base) vary in a coordinated manner. The iterative development of this research design can lead to substantive theoretical gains that augment and bolster discussions of Caddo ceramic morphological organization and vessel production.",TRUE,FALSE,3D|American Southeast|Caddo|geometric morphometrics|morphological disparity|morphological integration|NAGPRA|virtual archaeology,2018-07-02T11:56:49.821815,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-22T20:52:03.010702,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/citation/,esgxc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3v7we/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/relationships/node/,3v7we,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2d479dd65eaa0010d9975c/,5b2d479dd65eaa0010d9975c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esgxc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/esgxc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/esgxc

No consistent theoretical framework, however, defines, measures, and analyzes election-related content from within the media's coverage, particularly in emerging democracies. We apply machine learning techniques on texts from nearly 100,000 news articles during South Africa's 2014 election, and use a theoretically-informed classification of election coverage to demonstrate how the conceptual scope of elections shapes voters' campaign information environment. Our results produce distinct representations of political actors and institutions during elections: a narrow classification provides heuristics cuing race, party, and incumbent performance; a broad definition reflects policy and service concerns parties debated. Topic models and word vectors show that campaign content clusters with parties and their associations with government performance and policies, but candidates vary in how much distinct coverage they obtain on valence issues. We provide methods and evidence to replicably study electoral news coverage across developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Africa|comparative politics|elections|information|machine learning|South Africa|text as data,2018-07-02T11:56:49.670866,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-22T19:01:45.773522,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/citation/,af9jq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8kt92/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/relationships/node/,8kt92,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2d2e8bdaf8210010d3c37d/,5b2d2e8bdaf8210010d3c37d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af9jq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/af9jq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/af9jq

Snow’s The Two Cultures (1959) the divide between scientists and humanists is described as both practical and cultural. That is, scientists and humanists not only perform different jobs, but they also understand the world differently. Humanities for STEM: Using Archives to Bridge the Two Cultures Divide, a two-year research collaborative funded by New York University’s Center for the Humanities, re-investigates Snow’s thesis through the study of primary sources and archival research.

Archives, often thought to be squarely in the domain of the humanities, also contain primary source documents from the sciences and, therefore, can be used to enhance the understanding of STEM. Because this research collaborative posits that primary sources can aid STEM education and research, it becomes important to define what scientists and humanists understand primary sources to be. Is the term “primary source” part of the conceptual and cultural divide Snow describes?

In order to understand how a primary source is defined by various disciplines, research collaborative members created and disseminated a survey to faculty at New York University. The results of this survey led to an awareness that what is considered to be a primary source varies between disciplines. Although the notion that primary sources contain first-hand accounts of actual events was established across the disciplines, there was disagreement as to which formats were considered to be primary sources. Practitioners in STEM and social sciences considered journal articles and data sets to be primary sources. Humanities professionals were unique in their belief that “physical documents from an archive (eg., correspondence, photographs)” were one of the top forms of primary sources. With two working definitions of primary sources, it becomes clear that while faculty in most disciplines insist they are using primary sources, faculty from across the divide may disagree as to which documents are in fact primary sources. The differing definition of primary sources could lead to potential projects for either side: raw data and journal articles in historical contexts for humanities classrooms or innovative uses of letters, journals, and objects in STEM classrooms.",TRUE,FALSE,archives|conferenceproceeding|education|humanities|HumforSTEM2018|primary source|STEM,2018-07-02T11:56:49.477422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-22T15:49:51.877122,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/citation/,xz348,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/45yzh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/relationships/node/,45yzh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b202fc2ba5d13000d09249d/,5b202fc2ba5d13000d09249d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xz348/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xz348/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xz348
