Yet the literature has largely overlooked the fact that conjoint experiments are used for two distinct purposes: to uncover respondents' multidimensional preferences, and to estimate the causal effects of some attributes on a profile's selection probability in a multidimensional choice setting. This paper makes the argument that this distinction is both analytically and practically relevant, because the quantity of interest is contingent on the purpose of the study. The vast majority of social scientists relying on conjoint analyses, including most scholars interested in studying preferences, have adopted the average marginal component effect (AMCE) as their main quantity of interest. The paper shows that the AMCE is neither conceptually nor practically suited to explore respondents' preferences. Not only is it essentially a causal quantity conceptually at odds with the goal of describing patterns of preferences, but it also does generally not identify preferences, mixing them with compositional effects unrelated to preferences.

Innovations in causal inference have shed new light on these effects. Here, we motivate the importance of innovation in the characterization of fecundity, and prenatal selection in particular. We argue that such innovation is crucial for expanding knowledge of the fetal origins of later life health. Pregnancy loss is common, responsive to environmental factors, and closely related to maternal and fetal health outcomes. As a result, selection into live birth is driven by many of the same exposures that shape the health trajectories of survivors. Lifecourse effects that are inferred without accounting for these dynamics may be significantly distorted by survival bias. We use a set of Monte Carlo simulations with realistic parameters to examine the implications of prenatal survival bias. We find that even in conservatively specified scenarios, true fetal origin effects can be underestimated by 50% or more. In contrast, effects of exposures that reduce the probability of prenatal survival but improve the health of survivors will be overestimated. The absolute magnitude of survival bias can even exceed small effect sizes, resulting in inferences that beneficial exposures are harmful or vice-versa. We also find reason for concern that moderately sized true effects, underestimated due to failure to account for selective survival, are missing from scientific knowledge because they do not clear statistical significance filters. This bias has potential real-world costs; policy decisions about interventions to improve maternal and infant health will be affected by underestimated program impact.",TRUE,FALSE,cohort health|fecundity|fetal origins|lifecourse health|mortality selection|survival bias,2019-12-05T18:09:22.414129,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-05T18:08:45.536123,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/citation/,x4zm6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de81442ab905e000cf567aa/,5de81442ab905e000cf567aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4zm6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4zm6,NA

Several criteria exist for measuring pairwise dissimilarities among sequences. Typically, dissimilarity matrices are employed as input to heuristic clustering algorithms, with the aim of identifying the most relevant patterns in the data.

Here, we propose a model-based clustering approach for categorical sequence data. The technique is applied to a survey data set containing information on the career trajectories of a cohort of Northern Irish youths tracked between the ages of 16 and 22.

Specifically, we develop a family of methods for clustering sequences directly, based on mixtures of exponential-distance models, which we call MEDseq. The use of the Hamming distance or weighted variants thereof as the distance metrics permits closed-form expressions for the normalising constant, thereby facilitating the development of an ECM algorithm for model fitting. Additionally, MEDseq models allow the probability of component membership to depend on fixed covariates. Sampling weights, which are often associated with life-course data arising from surveys, are also accommodated. Simultaneously including weights and covariates in the clustering process yields new insights on the Northern Irish data.",TRUE,FALSE,exponential-distance models|gating covariates|Life-course data|model-based clustering|sequence analysis|survey sampling weights|weighted Hamming distance,2019-12-05T18:08:01.342946,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-05T18:07:34.086745,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/citation/,f5n8k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de7c691e1e62f000a334c46/,5de7c691e1e62f000a334c46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f5n8k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f5n8k,NA

Classification Approaches for German User Comments.,"Impoliteness and incivility in online discussions have recently been discussed as relevant issues in communication science. However, automatically detecting these concepts with computational methods is challenging. In our study, we build and compare supervised classification models to predict impoliteness and incivility in online discussions on German media outlets on Facebook. Using a sample of 10,000 hand-coded user comments and a theory-grounded coding scheme, we develop classifiers on different feature sets including unigram and n-gram distributions as well as various dictionary-based features. Our findings show that impoliteness and incivility can be measured to a certain extent on the word level of a comment, but the models suffer from high misclassification rates, even if lexical resources are included. This is mainly because the classifiers cannot reveal subtle forms of incivility and because comment authors often use predictive words of incivility or impoliteness in non-offensive ways or in different contexts. Still, when applying the classifiers to a comparable set of comments, we find that the machine-coded categories and the hand-coded categories reveal similar patterns regarding the distribution of and the user reactions to uncivil/impolite comments. The findings of our study therefore provide new insights into the supervised machine learning approach to the detection of different forms of offensive language.",TRUE,FALSE,automated content analysis|document classification|impoliteness|incivility|machine learning|online discussions|user comments,2019-12-04T11:33:06.011387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04T11:32:46.903605,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Speech and Rhetorical Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/citation/,a47ch,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de6e3d4ab905e000beeda29/,5de6e3d4ab905e000beeda29,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a47ch/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a47ch,NA

CMC researchers have suggested that emoticons behave much as do facial expressions in face-to-face interaction (e.g. Danet, Ruedenberg-Wright, &amp; Rosenbaum-Tamari, 1997; Rezabek &amp; Cochenour, 1998; Thompson &amp; Foulger, 1996). Some fMRI research suggests, however, that there is not a direct neural correspondence between emoticons and facial expressions, but that emoticons play an important role in determining the positive or negative valence of an utterance (Yuasa, Saito, &amp; Mukawa, 2011). Following the affective priming paradigm developed by Fazio, Sanbonmatsu, Powell, and Kardes (1986), this study explores the priming effects of emoticons vis-à-vis photographs of facial expression and emotional words on valence judgements of emotionally charged words. Significant main effects of age, prime valence, and target valence were found. There were also significant interactions between these three factors. Overall results suggest that younger and older participants have differing experiences of emoticons, with younger participants experiencing an effect of emoticons that is similar to the effect of facial expressions while older adults seem to experience emoticons in ways more like textual information or even just textual nonsense.",TRUE,FALSE,affect|CMC|computer mediated communication|emoticons|emotion|facial expression|FACS|psycholinguistics|sociolinguistics,2019-12-04T11:31:03.910676,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04T11:30:36.302801,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e00|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics,Brittney O'Neill,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/citation/,3zrf6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de6b62ae1e62f000b33ba31/,5de6b62ae1e62f000b33ba31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3zrf6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3zrf6,NA

The traditional publishing model does not support public access (i.e., no publisher paywall barrier) to scholarly journals. Newer models of publishing allow free access to research including open access publishing and deposit of scholarship in institutional or disciplinary repositories. This study examined public access to articles in the top 25 social work journals. A random sample of article citations from a total of 1,587 was assessed, with the result that 52% of citations had no full-text access. Of the remaining 48% of citations with full-text access, it is questionable most will remain available long term due to possible copyright violations. Citations from the random sample show only minimal usage of institutional or disciplinary repositories as a means of sharing research. Establishing this baseline measure of access to research is an important first step in understanding the barriers for social workers in accessing research to inform practice. Recommendations for increasing access to research include publishing in open access journals and utilizing full text repositories.",TRUE,FALSE,open access|research dissemination|social work,2019-12-04T11:29:02.503254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04T11:28:37.094359,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/citation/,9zxf2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de6ad0be1e62f000c3620ed/,5de6ad0be1e62f000c3620ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zxf2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9zxf2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9zxf2,https://doi.org/10.18060/22180

This renewed interest has been informed by new approaches that emphasize sensitive and critical periods during the first years of life, offer an understanding of human development as a hierarchical and cross-fertilizing process, suggest plausible mechanisms for the persistent effect of early exposures, and explore heterogeneity in effects based on environmental and biological factors. The articles included in this special issue of Population Research and Policy Review advance the field of early-life circumstances in several important dimensions. They examine the determinants and effects of noxious exposures at different developmental stages—ranging from the prenatal period to adolescence—in a variety of national settings. They offer an understanding of early-life circumstances that moves from discrete outcomes to a dynamic life-course approach, and consider diverse sources of heterogeneity in the effects of early exposures.",TRUE,FALSE,Child development|Early childhood|Early life|Environmental exposures|Health|Life course|Prenatal exposures|Stratification,2019-12-04T04:23:45.645214,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04T04:23:31.639880,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/citation/,b4hmv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de691f5ab905e000bee6225/,5de691f5ab905e000bee6225,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b4hmv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b4hmv,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-019-09555-w
