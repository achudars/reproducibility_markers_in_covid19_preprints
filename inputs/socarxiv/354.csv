Estimates of Gender Representation in Political Science,"Recent studies have identified gendered citation gaps in political science journal articles, with male scholars being less likely to cite work by female scholars in comparison to their female peers. While journal editors, editorial boards, and political scientists are becoming more aware of implicit biases and adopting strategies to remedy them, we know less about the proper baselines for citations in subfields and research areas of political science. Without information about how many women should be cited in a research field, it is difficult to know whether the distribution is biased. Using the gender distribution of membership in professional political science organizations and of article authors in 38 political science journals, we provide scholars with baselines for gender representation in citations.

We test whether higher levels of educational attainment are associated with the decrease in housework participation as the previous research in countries of the global north suggests. Our findings reveal that education is not likely to reduce housework participation among Japanese women. Married Japanese women with children are unlikely to reduce their time spent on housework with the increase of their educational level and married Japanese women without children are more likely to increase their housework participation proportionately to the level of their education.

Equally, such interactions are consequential for social capital, and may  be a dimension of cultural fit. Thus processes of status attainment and resource allocation may vary across workplaces in concert with their sociability. Using a new measure of time spent with coworkers, constructed using the American Time Use Survey, this paper shows that work explains a great deal more variation in sociability between coworkers than individual characteristics. The extent of shared workplace identities, influenced by occupational competition levels and union membership, and incentives to socialize are two important mechanisms in this process.

social and commercial. While the measurement of commercial performance is
relatively straightforward and well understood, our understanding of the factors
related to measuring social performance is more ambiguous. Is the adoption of
social performance measurement (SPM) practices more related to external pressures, such as the need to demonstrate legitimacy to funders and peers, or is it more closely related to the growing rationalization within the social sector? We examine the relationship between external and internal factors and the adoption of SPM using a novel dataset of 1864 nascent social enterprises from around the world.

enterprise is related to the growing rationalization of the social sector, which
challenges some of the past research on this topic, and provides a more nuanced

However, few archaeologists learn the skills necessary to conduct replication as part of their training. This means there is a gap between the ideals of archaeological science, and the skills we teach future researchers. Here we argue for replications as a core type of class assignment in archaeology courses to close this gap and establish a culture of replication and reproducibility. We review replication assignments in other fields, and describe how to implement a replication assignment suitable for many types of archaeology programs. We describe our experience with replication in an upper level undergraduate class on stone artefact analysis.

However, it has also been shown that these presumptions must be considered important factors for the formation of journalistic coverage. Against this background, this article synthesizes existing research on dimensions, determinants, and consequences of journalists’ presumptions of media effects. The resulting framework offers researchers in the field of journalistic content production a comprehensive overview of the possible role that presumptions of media effects could play for journalistic content creation.

Following the 2016 Stern Review and further rounds of technical consultation, the UK higher education community is now preparing for the next Research Excellence Framework – REF 2021.

Despite its importance in shaping UK research cultures, there is limited systematic and nuanced evidence about how academics across the sector view the REF, and which aspects are viewed favourably or unfavourably. The aims of this pilot study were twofold: first, it was designed to gather initial data to address this evidence gap; second, it was aimed at testing the feasibility of conducting a longitudinal study into academic and managerial attitudes towards the REF. We argue that further research to better understand the effects of the REF on research cultures, institutions, and individuals should be part of the evidence used to inform the development of future iterations of the exercise

Specifically, I show how queer white men tend to entrench racial hierarchy when (a) refusing to acknowledge queers of color as legitimate objects of love and sexual desire, and (b) fetishizing racial difference in ways that deny queers of color their human subjectivity. Having critiqued white gay men for colluding in the maintenance of white supremacy, I conclude by brainstorming what a radically antiracist approach to queer desire might look like. Using notions of “racework” and “decolonial love,” I challenge white queer individuals to radically re-conceptualize our ideas and our practice of desire.",TRUE,FALSE,interaction|performativity|queer|racialization|sexuality,2019-06-20T09:32:21.559159,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-20T09:32:08.257100,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction",Andrew J Shapiro,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/citation/,8wha2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d09acc23466a6001d90e346/,5d09acc23466a6001d90e346,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wha2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8wha2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8wha2,NA
