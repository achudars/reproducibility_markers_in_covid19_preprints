Over the last decade, the problem of orphan works — i.e., copyrighted 
works whose owners cannot be located by a reasonably diligent search — 
has come sharply into focus as libraries, archives, and other large 
repositories of copyrighted works have sought to digitize and make 
available their collections online. Although this problem is certainly 
not limited to digital libraries, it has proven especially challenging 
for these organizations because they hold diverse collections that 
include millions of books, articles, letters, photographs, home movies, 
films, and other types of works. Many items come with a complex, 
unknown, and (often) unknowable history of copyright ownership. Because 
U.S. copyright law provides for both strong injunctive relief and 
monetary damages (in the form of statutory damages of up to $150,000 per 
work infringed), organizations that cannot obtain permission often do 
not make their collections available at all.

In October 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office initiated a new study of 
orphan works and mass digitization, and has indicated that it is a 
high-priority policy issue for the office. That study, and the work that 
preceded it, has highlighted the wide array of perspectives about why 
and how to address the orphan works problem. In this article, we present 
evidence that the orphan works problem is very real and that it inhibits 
many socially valuable uses of copyrighted works by libraries, archives, 
museums and other memory institutions. We then canvass the array of 
potential solutions, and ultimately conclude that fair use, combined 
with the Copyright Office’s remedy limitation approach, are better 
approaches for addressing this problem in the United States than 
alternatives proposed elsewhere. Finally, we explore future-looking 
changes, such as the reintroduction of copyright formalities and the 
development of registries, that would reduce the number of orphan works 
in the future.

Numerous legal regimes or proposals have been devised to address the 
problem of whether or under what circumstances in-copyright works can be 
made available if the works are “orphans,” because their rights holders 
are unknown or cannot be found. A common feature is a requirement that a 
prospective user make a diligent search for the rights holder. This 
White Paper complements an earlier one on orphan work searches which 
considered who would be expected to conduct a search. The present White 
Paper focuses instead on different conceptions about what a diligent 
search might consist of. It does not offer a normative assessment of 
what “diligent search” should mean. Rather, it intends to provide 
information about various approaches to this concept to aid in reasoned 
conversations about this concept.

Over the past several years, policy makers and private actors have 
developed an evolving set of approaches for addressing the orphan works 
problem — a problem that arises when “the owner of a copyrighted work 
cannot be identified and located by someone who wishes to make use of 
the work in a manner that requires permission of the copyright owner,” 
preventing follow-on uses of works. These approaches usually attempt to 
address the orphan works problem by employing some threshold mechanism 
to differentiate true orphan works, to which the proposed solutions 
would apply, from non-orphaned copyrighted works. Satisfying a 
“reasonably diligent search” is one well-known formulation by which 
users can designate works as orphaned and therefore subject to a 
proposed solution, though — as this paper points out — alternative 
approaches certainly exist. Regardless of the specific formulation, the 
search for rightsholders (or conversely, the confirmation that no 
rightsholder can be located) is an integral component of almost every 
orphan works proposal. This paper examines in detail the core schemes 
for identifying rightsholders among the leading orphan works regimes and 
proposals. Although these schemes differ across many variables, three 
factors predominate: (1) who is expected to participate in the search 
process, (2) the nature and extent of the required search generally; and 
(3) specifically what types of resources, tools, registries or other 
information-sharing mechanisms are required or allowed.

This paper compares existing proposals’ approaches with respect to the 
first factor: who participates in a search? A subsequent paper will 
focus on the second and third factors.

Many works that libraries, archives, and historical societies would like 
to digitize are “orphan works,” that is, works for which the copyright 
holder either is unknown or cannot be located after a diligent search. 
Due to copyright risk if an owner later shows up, nonprofit libraries 
and similar institutions have been reluctant to digitize and make these 
works available, greatly limiting access to important cultural and 
historical information.

While a legislative fix may soon be proposed, this Article argues that 
legislation is not necessary to enable some uses of orphan works by 
nonprofit libraries and archives. Instead, U.S. copyright law’s fair use 
doctrine, which allows certain unpermissioned uses of copyrighted works, 
provides a partial solution.

Though it is an incomplete solution, fair use has some significant 
advantages over other approaches through which libraries and archives 
could make publicly beneficial uses of orphan works. Under fair use, 
there is no need to develop a licensing system, significantly reducing 
administrative and transactional costs, and eliminating socially 
wasteful license fees for works that are not on the market, and for 
which an owner is unlikely to exist. Second, fair use has the 
flexibility to accommodate change over time as libraries and archives 
discover the best ways to search for owners, preserve works, and make 
them available. Finally, allowing fair use of orphans by libraries and 
archives helps fulfill copyright’s critical purposes of promoting the 
dissemination of knowledge and supporting speech and free expression.

Historically, Open Innovation Communities (OICs), such as those who make 
free and open source software (FOSS), have opted out of the patent 
system for three main reasons: Patents are expensive to acquire and 
enforce; they are philosophically, culturally, and politically anathema 
to many OIC members; and even when they appear to be acquired for 
“defensive” or other altruistic purposes, there has been no guarantee 
against someone later “weaponizing” them for use in an offensive attack.

In this article, we first analyze how and why various OICs have 
approached strategic concerns about intellectual property and then make 
a case for why OICs should – and indeed must – opt back into the patent 
system if they wish to protect themselves from the growing threats that 
patents pose, including threats from the increasingly complex “thicket” 
of patents on software, standards, and ecosystems that have become the 
battlegrounds over technologies such as smartphones, online video, and 
social media. We support our argument with a proposal for a new OIC 
patent license – the Defensive Patent License. Built on legal and 
normative approaches similar to the GNU General Public License and 
Creative Commons licensing, the DPL directly addresses the three reasons 
for OIC opt-out and provides several positive reasons for opting in, 
including increasing access and interoperability between OIC 
technologies, improving the prior art, imposing legally-binding 
restrictions that require DPL patents to remain “defensive,” and 
preventing patent trolls, “bullies,” or others from ever asserting DPL 
patents against those who use the license. We end with a comparison of 
the DPL to other OIC patent strategies to situate it within the current 
set of options OICs face in dealing with patent threats.

Most Americans have not heard of 'Do Not Track,' a proposal to allow 
Internet users to exercise more control over online advertising. 
However, when probed, most prefer that Do Not Track block advertisers 
from collecting data about their online activities. This is a much more 
privacy-protective approach for Do Not Track than what has been proposed 
by the advertising industry.

In previous studies, we have found that Americans think they are 
protected by strong online privacy laws. Here, we probed beliefs about 
tracking on medical websites and 'free' websites, with most not able to 
answer true/false questions correctly about tracking. This result brings 
into question notice-and-choice models that depend on consumer 
understanding of the terms for their legitimacy.

We also probed Internet users' attitudes towards advertising. Most 
Internet users say that they do not find utility in online advertising, 
with half claiming that they never click on ads.

Advertisers and consumers are at an impasse on privacy. Advertisers seem 
to be seeking a kind of total information awareness for behavioral 
advertising, and have proposed self-regulatory guidelines with little 
bite. At the same time, both our survey evidence and media reports show 
consumer opposition to tracking.

Do Not Track has emerged from the current skirmish between consumers and 
advertisers, but it is a relatively modest intervention that does little 
to shift the underlying incentives that have driven increasing tracking 
and aggregation of information about consumers. It is foreseeable that 
regardless of the form Do Not Track takes, websites will simply require 
consumers to disable it in order to access content. A fundamental change 
in incentives may be necessary to relieve this impasse and find an 
approach for advertising that is not so dependent upon third-party 
tracking and aggregation of information, both online and off.

Mobile phones are a rich source of personal information about 
individuals. Both private and public sector actors seek to collect this 
information. Facebook, among other companies, recently ignited a 
controversy by collecting contact lists from users’ mobile phones via 
its mobile app. A recent Congressional investigation found that law 
enforcement agencies sought access to wireless phone records over one 
million times in 2011. As these developments receive greater attention 
in the media, a public policy debate has started concerning the 
collection and use of information by private and public actors.

To inform this debate and to better understand Americans’ attitudes 
towards privacy in data generated by or stored on mobile phones, we 
commissioned a nationwide, telephonic (both wireline and wireless) 
survey of 1,200 households focusing upon mobile privacy issues.

We found that Americans overwhelmingly consider information stored on 
their mobile phones to be private — at least as private as information 
stored on their home computers. They also overwhelmingly reject several 
types of data collection and use drawn from current business practices. 
Specifically, large majorities reject the collection of contact lists 
stored on the phone for the purposes of tailoring social network 
“friend” suggestions and providing coupons, the collection of location 
data for tailoring ads, and the use of wireless contact information for 
telemarketing, even where there is a business relationship between the 
consumer and merchant.

Respondents evinced strong support for substantial limitations on the 
retention of wireless phone usage data. Respondents also thought that 
some prior court oversight is appropriate when police seek to search a 
wireless phone when arresting an individual.
