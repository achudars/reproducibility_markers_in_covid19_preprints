More focused concepts are needed to understand the form and function of different phenomena of visibility. In this article, we develop a definition of organizational transparency as systematic disclosure programs that meet the information needs of other actors. Organizational transparency, we argue, is best studied as an inter-organizational negotiation process on the field- level. To evaluate its merit, we apply this framework to a case study on the introduction of open data in the Berlin city administration. Analyzing the politics of disclosure, we learn about the similarities and differences between phenomena of visibility (e.g. open data, freedom of information), explore the transformative power of negotiating transparency, and deduce recommendations for managing transparency.",TRUE,FALSE,Information disclosure|open data|Organizational transparency,2020-09-18T21:36:41.576456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-18T21:36:31.854782,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/citation/,8c7qt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f64d94b57f28c00501336bb/,5f64d94b57f28c00501336bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c7qt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8c7qt/,https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.12895,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8c7qt

In recent years, these technological developments together with other macro-phenomena like globalization and rising distrust of institutions has led to unprecedented public expectations regarding organizational transparency. In this study I explore the ways in which organizations resolve the tension between a growing norm to share internal information with the public and their inherent preferences for informational control. Through developing the notion of transparency decoupling, I examine how organizations respond strategically to transparency expectations. Drawing on studies of “open data” transparency initiatives in NYC, London, and Berlin, I inductively carve out three modes of institutional information decoupling: (a) selecting the disclosed information to exclude parts of the data or parts of the audience; (b) bending the information in order to retain some control over its representative value; (c) orchestrating new information for a particular audience.

In the present article I turn to the example of Open Data web portals – specialized websites that make large amounts of governmental datasets publicly available – to show how they relate to the status quo of social research on functional differentiation. For my analysis of the Chilean Portal de Datos Públicos I developed a method to link metadata categories from the web portal to a hard-core list of ten function systems. My results confirm literature, which finds economized or politicized forms of societal self-description. Moreover the results are in line with studies that show the vanishing role of religion. Interestingly, my study finds health to be of high importance – I might even speak of a “healthized” self-observation – which I argue is at odds with a negligible representation of the function system “sport” within the self-observation.

Because there is a limit to the number of years that can separate the dates of death of related individuals, the ability to identify first-, second-, and third-degree relatives through aDNA analysis can serve as a constraint on radiocarbon date range estimates. To determine the number of years that can separate related individuals, we modeled maximums derived from biological extremes of human reproduction and death ages and compiled data from historic and genealogical death records. We used these estimates to evaluate the date ranges of a global dataset of individuals that have been radiocarbon dated and for which ancient DNA analysis identified at least one relative. We found that many of these individuals could have their date ranges reduced by building in date of death separation constraints. We examined possible reasons for date discrepancies of related individuals, such as dating of different skeletal elements or wiggles in the radiocarbon curve.

The term has evolved from only focusing on the human kind to reconciliation between humans and nature. On one hand, this evolution opens space for nature and vulnerable people to be acknowledged, on the other hand, it raises difficulties in implementing the idea due to its heterogeneity. By the mid 1990s, for instance, there were more than 100 definitions of sustainability (Marshall and Toffel, 2005). Rather than following previous scholars trying to find a general definition for sustainability, we try to approach it through the idea of translation.

Every year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement imprisons hundreds of thousands of noncitizens as they await adjudication on their deportation proceedings, sometimes for months or years at a time. Many detained individuals have lived in the United States for decades and have spouses and/or dependent children that rely on them. This analysis brings together research on immigrant families, mass incarceration, and system avoidance to examine the spillover consequences of immigration detention. Using a multigenerational and multi-perspective research design, we analyze 104 interviews conducted in California with detained parents, non-detained spouses/partners, and their school-age children. Findings suggest that members of these mixed-status families may limit their engagement with surveilling institutions during a family member’s detention. These experiences are rooted in what we call compounded vulnerability—that is, both in the experience of parental/spousal confinement but also in their positionality as members of mixed-immigration-status families facing the possibility of deportation.",TRUE,FALSE,compounded vulnerability|Immigration detention|mixed-status families|parental incarceration|system avoidance,2020-09-18T07:08:42.571862,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-18T07:08:31.809789,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Caitlin Patler,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/citation/,7cgzp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f63d03d11fb7c005118ff25/,5f63d03d11fb7c005118ff25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cgzp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7cgzp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7cgzp

However, a substantial share of annual redistribution might turn out to serve individual insurance in a longer perspective, reducing the level of actual redistribution across individuals. This paper investigates to what extent long-run redistribution diverges from annual redistribution in welfare states of different types. Exploiting panel data from the Cross-National Equivalent File (CNEF) for Australia, Germany, South Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we find that welfare states like Germany that are assumed to engage in a high level of redistribution actually achieve relatively less redistribution between individuals in the long run than the United Kingdom or the United States. Regression results show that a higher share of elderly in a country is associated with more annual redistribution, but with less long-run redistribution between individuals. The results suggest that, in welfare states with aging populations, we might expect growing annual redistribution that, to a substantial extent, is in fact income smoothing for the elderly.

Sex workers sit at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities and makeup a sizable workforce: the UN estimates that at least 42 million sex workers are conducting business across the globe. Yet, little research has examined how well technology fulfills sex workers’ business needs in the face of unique social, political, legal, and safety constraints.We present interviews with 29 sex workers in Germany and Switzerland where such work is legal, offering a first HCI perspective on this population’s use of technology.   While our participants demonstrate savvy navigation of online spaces, sex workers encounter frustrating barriers due to anAmerican-dominated internet that enforces puritan values globally.

The paper examines four Euro Area countries, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain and extends the systematic comparison to the US and the UK. It finds that many of those currently at the top of the wealth distribution did not benefit from intergenerational transfers, but those who did received particularly large amounts while those toward the bottom of the wealth distribution received very little. A substantial gap in net wealth is seen between those who received or did not receive some wealth transfer. Controlling for age, gender, education and household size reduces the size of that gap but it remains substantial, especially in the US. We further look at how a marginal increase in the proportion of recipients of transfers of differing sizes would contribute to the shape of the overall wealth distribution using influence function regressions. Crucially, we show that the impact depends not only on the locations in the wealth distributions of recipients versus non-recipients, but also on the size of the receipt, an aspect which has been overlooked to date. In most countries, increasing the proportion of recipients of large transfers generally increases overall wealth inequality. In contrast, having more recipients of small or medium- sized transfers would be expected to reduce wealth inequality modestly, as they are more concentrated around the middle of the wealth distribution than non-recipients.

A case study in Birmingham.,"Objectives: This paper disentangles the degree of concentration and variance in offender residences across different levels of spatial aggregation. Three nested units are analysed simultaneously (and longitudinally) to explore the impact of using different spatial scales, opening prospect for a comparison with existing findings from crime concentration literature. Methods: Data is utilized from West Midlands Police Force, containing the locations of residence for all known offenders in Birmingham between the years 2006 and 2016. Resident locations are aggregated to 3223 Output Areas (OA), nested within 639 Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA), further nested within 132 Middle Super Output Areas (MSOA). Descriptive and model-based statistics are deployed to replicate a recent study for crime events (Steenbeek &amp; Weisburd, 2016). Results: In contrast to the crime concentration literature, the results indicate that most variance (~50%) in offender residence concentrations is attributable to the largest spatial scale (MSOA level). Output Areas, as the most fine-grained unit, capture approximately 39% of the variance, although this proportion increases during the study period at the expense of MSOA. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the relationship between variance and scale when studying offender residences is not as clear-cut as it is for crimes. Larger units hold some merit (empirically and theoretically), but this is time-dependent, opening up discussions on the role of urban development in determining the appropriateness of spatial scale.",TRUE,FALSE,crime|geography|hierarchical|offenders|scale,2020-09-18T14:56:42.542207,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-18T14:55:52.543280,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/citation/,xe7fq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rg4pu/,rg4pu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f638adab0d9a5006ccaec6d/,5f638adab0d9a5006ccaec6d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7fq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xe7fq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xe7fq
