Our data come from approximately 7500 households who either remain in the TVP program, join, or leave during the period of the study. Because of particular features of these data, we use recently developed understanding of the two-way fixed effects differences-in-differences estimator along with event-study specifications to interpret our results in terms of bounds on the true estimate. Similar to previous research, we find that the program reduces consumption during peak-hours. However, in contrast with previous research, we find that the program increases total consumption. We explain the differences between our results and the typical finding with a simple economic framework that is based on the setting we study – common to many low-and-middle-income tropical countries – very few households have heating or cooling devices. While previous research used data from rich countries in which the use of heating and cooling devices drives electricity consumption is prevalent, in our setting, since there is no room for technological changes, behavioral changes to reduce consumption during peak hours are not enough to offset the increased consumption during peak hours. Our results serve as a cautionary piece of evidence for policy makers interested in reducing consumption during peak hours – the goal can potentially be achieved with TVP, but the cost is increased total consumption.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral adjustments|developing country|dynamic pricing|energy,2020-03-16T18:10:22.912664,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-16T18:09:58.144582,FALSE,NA,no,We do not have permission to share the data.,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Tabaré Capitán,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/citation/,wcz8s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jrmaq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/relationships/node/,jrmaq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6fa95b4a60a5039fbb9e5a/,5e6fa95b4a60a5039fbb9e5a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcz8s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wcz8s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wcz8s,NA

This paper contributes to the understanding of how the NRA influenced the transformation of the cultural meaning of the Second Amendment by linking historical American narratives about masculine sacrifice to antigovernment new warrior culture following Vietnam, filling them with Christian nationalist language that rejects government authority to limit the Second Amendment. Using the NRA’s most mainstream and longest running magazine the American Rifleman, I demonstrate how the transformation of the cultural meaning of sacrifice underlies the transformation of meaning of the Second Amendment. This paper explores how the meaning of “sacrifice” in America’s gun culture transformed, alongside what it means to “be a Christian” as well as a “good citizen”. I demonstrate how the anti-government New Warrior culture has merged with Christian nationalist rhetoric to move the Second Amendment beyond the rule of law.

Because children’s attainments are negatively associated with growing up in non-standard family structures, changes in family structures are often considered to have strengthened the reproduction of social inequalities across generations. We argue that the validity of this argument depends on variation in how family structure affects children’s attainments, a premise we label heterogeneity in attainment penalties. Previous research has documented heterogeneity in attainment penalties across social groups and by gender. Therefore, the role of family structure in reproducing inequalities is unclear and might vary by gender too. We use data from the NLSY 1979 and 1997 cohorts to estimate the contribution of changes in family structures to parental education differences in educational attainment for boys and girls. We estimate extended Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition models which take into account both cross-cohort changes in the prevalence of family structures and heterogeneity in related penalties. Changes in the prevalence and penalties related to childhood family structures account for a 15% increase in the parental education gap in educational attainment for girls but reduced the attainment gap for boys by 13%.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Family Structure|Gender|Inequality of Opportunity|Social Stratification,2020-03-17T16:47:21.561728,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-17T16:34:46.081594,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/citation/,c3mpx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pm8nh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/relationships/node/,pm8nh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6f4e890cd06c0372003f93/,5e6f4e890cd06c0372003f93,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c3mpx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c3mpx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c3mpx,NA

A small number of studies suggest that the remaining gender gap can be attributed to horizontal segregation with respect to field of study, particularly female underrepresentation in STEM fields, and little is known about trends in sex segregation by field in Japan specifically. By using publicly available education statistics, the current study investigates these trends from 1975 through 2019. We paid particular attention to (1) different trends in non-STEM, STEM, and health fields, and (2) heterogeneity across national, public, and private institutions. The results of applying Duncan’s dissimilarity index to 68 fields of study among four-year university students reveal that the overall trend in sex segregation in field of study has decreased over the 45 years by 43%. We also found that trends differ based on both institutional characteristics of universities and academic field, as the declining segregation trend is mainly driven by the massive integration of men and women in non-STEM fields in private institutions. The declining trend in segregation has been slow in recent years, especially at national and public institutions. We explored potential mechanisms for these stalling trends, and suggest that the driving forces are (1) a slower integration of women in STEM fields and (2) a rise in segregation in health fields. These results provide support for the theory of a stalled gender revolution in Japan. This study concludes that the desegregation may not be linked to the gender equality in the labor market, and that horizontal segregation may even increase because of the growing demand for the workforce to deal with population aging in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,field of study|higher education|japan|sex segregation,2020-03-16T18:04:05.352276,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-16T18:03:52.618562,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/citation/,dgn7e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6e98734a60a502fabb3615/,5e6e98734a60a502fabb3615,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgn7e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dgn7e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dgn7e,NA

In this paper, we use the concept of the spirit of capitalism to shed light on the ways in which normative beliefs inform and justify the business models of tech companies. We first reconstruct, systematize and operationalize the concept of the capitalist spirit. We then argue that solutionist ideas have become central to the (self-)image of today’s tech companies. Solutionism refers to the idea that the use of technologies – by inventive and cunning entrepreneurs – is the royal road to fixing social problems. We use a classification algorithm trained on handcoded documents to empirically trace the relative importance of solutionist vis-`a-vis other normative beliefs in three novel text corpora. We find that solutionist ideas are indeed central to the worldview of tech elites, and that they are also gaining ground in the broader tech milieu, although not yet in the normative discourse of capitalism at large.

With growing public consciousness and the challenging context posed by climate change both economically, socially and for biodiversity, researchers should be leading the path towards sustainable event planning. In this article, we propose key performances indicators that not only prioritize environmental goals, but also integrate socio-economic considerations at the roots of the planning cycle. We further discuss the added risks and remaining barriers, at the host organisation and destination levels, to plan a sustainable event. By changing the way that research conferences are organized, the scientific community can incorporate their values, knowledge and passion to strengthen existing standards and frameworks. We hope that, as event sustainability becomes more salient and institutions more prone to sharing lessons learned, sustainable events become the norm for all research conferences and meetings.",TRUE,FALSE,Congress|Corporate and Social Responsibility|Environmental Footprint|Event planning|Impact|Meeting,2020-03-14T16:24:20.932361,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-14T16:24:01.558480,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/citation/,yqcr6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6ba2a90cd06c01ba00199b/,5e6ba2a90cd06c01ba00199b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqcr6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yqcr6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yqcr6,NA

While some seem to take pride in this reputation, the absence of a coherent definition frequently sparks off acrimonious criticism and debates. More importantly, though, it increasingly becomes a liability in the context of the progressive institutionalization of the digital humanities.

    Rather than vainly trying to find a definition of digital humanities that is at the same time descriptive and rigorous, we propose a stipulative definition that separates them into theoretical and applied digital humanities: the theoretical digital humanities are the metascientific discipline whose goal is the conception of formal methods that the applied digital humanities use to create formal models in the various humanities disciplines.",TRUE,FALSE,academic disciplines|definition|digital humanities|formal models|terminology,2020-03-14T16:22:41.865572,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-14T16:22:22.316247,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/citation/,v9t8d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6b78df4a60a501cabb26d6/,5e6b78df4a60a501cabb26d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9t8d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9t8d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9t8d,NA
