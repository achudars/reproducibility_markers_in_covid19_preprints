unions in recent decades to extend organizational theory about how
categorization systems are reproduced and break down. Recent categorization
research emphasizes cognitive mechanisms for the reproduction of category
schemes: actors explicitly evaluate organizations against an ideal set of
categories. This article argues that category schemes can also be
reproduced as the epiphenomena of stable social interactions. Such
“relational” mechanisms are particularly useful for understanding why
specialized organizations sometimes manage to diversify, despite having
similar audiences. When stable patterns of social interaction are
disrupted, category schemes that were reproduced by such interactions
quickly fall apart. Predictions based on this theory are tested on the
attempts by American labor unions to diversify their memberships between
1961 and 1999. Consistent with the theory, workers after the early 1980s
came to vote for unions that diversified their organizing across
industries, but only if those unions had adopted organizational reforms
consistent with those described in recent literature on labor-union
revitalization. The interaction between such revitalization attempts by
individual unions and the strength of union jurisdiction is explored using
a combination of interviews with current and former union staff and
organizers, and quantitative analysis of four decades’ organizing drives.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:44.450328,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-17T22:30:29.820000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/citation/,v56ft,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6qkka/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/relationships/node/,6qkka,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57ddc407594d9001ec1ee0cd/,57ddc407594d9001ec1ee0cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v56ft/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v56ft/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v56ft

benefits officers throughout their career. However, multiple theoretical

specialization benefits workers because it gives them skills that make them
more productive, while another suggests that specialization is a signal of

complicated because adopting such policies may be endogenous to the firm’s
wish to hire and promote women and minorities. This study uses unionization
elections to conduct a regression-discontinuity test from which stronger
causal inferences can be made. I find that while unionization is associated
with more representative workplaces and more women and minorities in

in membership rather than the outcome of specific organizing drives, and

paying less attention for example to the role of employers. I explore the
role of racial and ethnic diversity in the outcomes of nearly 7,000
organizing drives launched between 1999 and 2008. By matching the National
Labor Relations Board’s information on union activity with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission’s surveys of large establishments, I
reconstruct the demographic composition of the work groups involved in each
mobilization. I find that more diverse establishments are less likely to
see successful organizing attempts. However, I find little evidence that
this is because workers are less interested in voting for unions. Instead,
I find that the organizers of more diverse units are more likely to give up
before such elections are held. Furthermore, this higher quit rate can be
explained best by the other organizations involved in the organizing drive.
In particular, employers are more likely to be charged with unfair labor
practices when the unit in question is more racially diverse. This effect

that are more enmeshed in clusters of technical interdependence are less
likely to die. At the same time, being part of such a cluster means that a
job is more vulnerable if its neighbors disappear. And the ""protection"" of

It has special global significance for its record of early pelagic fishing and ancient shell fish hooks. It is also of regional significance for its early occupation and comparatively large assemblage of Pleistocene stone artefacts. Three major findings arise from our study of the stone artefacts. First, there is little change in lithic technology over the 42,000 year sequence, with the most noticeable change being the addition of new artefact types and raw materials in the mid-Holocene. Second, the assemblage is dominated by small chert cores and implements rather than pebble toolsand choppers, a pattern we argue is common in island SE Asian sites as opposed to mainland SE Asian sites. Third, the Jerimalai assemblage bears a striking resemblance to the assemblage from Liang Bua, argued by the Liang Bua excavation team to be associated with Homo floresiensis. We argue that the near proximity of these two islands along the Indonesian Island chain (c.100km apart), the long antiquity of modern human occupation in the region (as documented at Jerimalai), and the strong resemblance of distinctive flake stone technologies seen at both sites, raises the intriguing possibility that both the Liang Bua and Jerimalai assemblages were created by modern humans.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:27.018650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-16T16:00:17.805000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/citation/,63zey,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rj655/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/relationships/node/,rj655,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e5caf99ad5a101fb77c765/,57e5caf99ad5a101fb77c765,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/63zey/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/63zey

While in other countries these tax credits were refundable, the United States alone introduced a nonrefundable CTC. As a result, the United States was the only country in which poor and working-class families were paradoxically excluded from these new benefits. A comparative analysis of Canada and the United States shows that American exceptionalism resulted from the cultural legacy of distinct public policies. We argue that policy changes in the 1940s institutionalized different ""logics of appropriateness"" that later constrained policymakers in the 1990s. Specifically, the introduction of family allowances in Canada and other LWR countries naturalized a logic of income supplementation in which families could legitimately receive cash benefits without the stigma of ""welfare."" Lacking this policy legacy, American attempts to introduce a refundable CTC were quickly derailed by policymakers who saw it as equivalent to welfare. Instead, they introduced a narrow, nonrefundable CTC under the alternative logic of ""tax relief,"" even though this meant excluding the lowest-income families. The cultural legacy of past policies can explain American exceptionalism not only with regard to CTCs but to other social policies as well.",TRUE,FALSE,child poverty|fiscal sociology|historical institutionalism|Preprint|socarxiv|tax credits|welfare states,2018-07-02T10:51:44.288155,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-16T14:36:48.379000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/citation/,n95gm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q98y2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/relationships/node/,q98y2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57dc03819ad5a101eae6a02a/,57dc03819ad5a101eae6a02a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n95gm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n95gm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n95gm
