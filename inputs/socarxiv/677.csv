Analyses of these data allow for new insights into movement emergence, consequences, and tactical innovation and adaptation. One of the issues with this kind of analysis, however, is that the generation of event data is incredibly costly. Human coders must pore through news sources, looking for instances of protest and coding many variables by hand. Because of the high labor costs, projects are typically limited to one or two newspapers per country. This, in turn, exacerbates issues of selection and description biases.

This article aims to address this issue with the development, validation, and application of a system for automating the generation of protest event data. This system, called the Machine-Learning Protest Event Data System (MPEDS), is the first of its kind coming from within the social movement community. MPEDS uses recent innovations from machine learning and natural language processing to generate protest event data with little to no human intervention. The system aims to have the effect of increasing the speed and reducing the labor costs associated with identifying and coding collective action events in news sources, thus increasing the timeliness of protest data and reducing biases due to excessive reliance on too few news sources. Work on MPEDS is ongoing, and to that end, the system will also be open, available for replication, and extendable by future social movement researchers, and social and computational scientists.",TRUE,FALSE,machine learning|nlp|protest event data|social movements|text analysis,2018-07-02T10:55:01.753647,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-10T16:47:39.705000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/citation/,xuqmv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sk5ab/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/relationships/node/,sk5ab,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58750fc4b83f6902020665aa/,58750fc4b83f6902020665aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xuqmv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xuqmv,NA

A test of five diversity indices in Germany,"An ever-growing number of studies investigates the relation between ethnic diversity and social cohesion, but these studies have produced mixed results. In cross-national research, some scholars have recently started to investigate more refined and informative indices of ethnic diversity than the commonly used Hirschman-Herfindahl Index. These refined indices allow to test competing theoretical explanations of why ethnic diversity is associated with declines in social cohesion. This study assesses the applicability of this approach for sub-national analyses. Generally, the results confirm a negative association between social cohesion and ethnic diversity. However, the competing indices are empirically indistinguishable and thus insufficient to test different theories against one another. Follow-up simulations suggest the general conclusion that the competing indices are meaningful operationalizations only if a sample includes: (1) contextual units with small and contextual units with large minority shares, as well as (2) contextual units with diverse and contextual units with polarized ethnic compositions. The results are thus instructive to all researchers who wish to apply different diversity indices and thereby test competing theories.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity indices|entropy|ethnic diversity|Germany|immigration|SocArXiv|social capital|social cohesion,2018-07-02T10:53:43.154529,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-10T12:50:23.466000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,Elsevier,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/citation/,upucm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pm2zh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/relationships/node/,pm2zh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5874d5f3b83f6901fe0663f0/,5874d5f3b83f6901fe0663f0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/upucm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/upucm,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.12.018

Islamic banking and finance, research in this area still needs to be classified as
nascent. Recent economic events have led to an increasingly critical attitude
towards the conventional banking and finance system, whereas Islamic banking is
considered to be an ethical alternative not only in Muslim economies but also
progressively in the “western” world. As their business models have their origins
in religious and ethical ideals, Islamic banks struggle to observe the foundational
Shariah principles while simultaneously meeting applicable guidelines such as
Basel III and flexibly adapt to the ever changing customer demands. Due to the
increasing importance of Islamic banking and finance, this article aims to analyse

In contrast to U.S.- based studies, the findings showed striking gender differences in the association between economic factors and relationship satisfaction for Germans. In cross-sectional models, women’s relationship satisfaction was positively associated with receiving government economic support, and men’s satisfaction was positively associated with poverty status and negatively associated with being a breadwinner. Longitudinal models revealed that changes in poverty status are associated with women’s satisfaction, but men’s satisfaction remains tied to their role as family provider.

At the same time, economics displaced law as the dominant form of antitrust expertise. While these developments are related, the former cannot be reduced to the latter: the median position in economics itself shifted from high-enforcement to low-enforcement during this period, and by its end was moving back toward more enforcement. To understand the relationship between these changes, this paper conceptualizes academic economics and antitrust policy as linked fields with relative autonomy. Though economics came to play a key role in antitrust policy, its influence was in some ways limited. The academic field was itself shaped, though not determined, by outside political interests. In addition, not all academically influential ideas translated equally well into policy. A wide range of economists shared a commitment to efficiency as the main purpose of antitrust, however, which delegitimized other historical goals of antitrust policy and constrained political possibilities in lasting ways.",TRUE,FALSE,antitrust|economics|economic sociology|expertise|policy|political sociology|sociology of knowledge,2018-07-02T10:51:50.310469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-08T18:30:14.357000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/citation/,qhgdk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpzyu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/relationships/node/,tpzyu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5872843f9ad5a101ff8b0eb0/,5872843f9ad5a101ff8b0eb0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qhgdk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qhgdk,NA

To answer these questions, we estimated regression models predicting respondent reports of conflict and affection in cohabiting and married partner relationships using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, 1997 (NLSY97, N = 2, 841) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health, N = 1, 702).

The Reanimation Library. A Library of Approximate Location. These are not typical names for libraries but they are tantalising and they are real. Each of these libraries has been created by an artist and they are not the only ones. These libraries function both as libraries and as art installations and can be temporary exhibitions or permanent installations. Some are recognisably libraries and others are not. Some are tied to a specific place and others are peripatetic. They are scattered around the globe and, as well as investigating artistic themes of time, loss, place and memory, consider the library as subject as well as object. As such, they raise interesting questions for librarians. What does the library symbolise for the artist and the audience? What are the motivations of the artists involved? What purposes do these libraries aim to achieve? What does it mean for the artist to become the librarian? What are the implications for us as librarians? What can we learn from these artist libraries?

Regulators, much like market actors, rely on categorical distinctions to understand and act on the market. Innovations that are ambiguous to regulatory categories but not to market actors present a problem for regulators and an opportunity for innovative firms to evade or upend the existing order. We trace the history of one class of innovative financial derivatives—interest rate and foreign exchange swaps—to show how these instruments under- mined the separation of commercial and investment banking established by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. Swaps did not fit neatly into existing product categories—futures, securities, loans—and thus evaded regulatory scrutiny for decades. The market success of swaps put commercial and investment banks into direct competition, and in so doing undermined Glass-Steagall. Drawing on this case, we theorize some of the political and market conditions under which regulations may be especially vulnerable to disruption by ambiguous innovations.",TRUE,FALSE,derivatives|economic sociology|finance|organizations|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:49.110471,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-03T15:39:23.414000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/citation/,wpwe6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7x9vs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/relationships/node/,7x9vs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/586bc4ec9ad5a10208ba7491/,586bc4ec9ad5a10208ba7491,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wpwe6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wpwe6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wpwe6,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839214554830
