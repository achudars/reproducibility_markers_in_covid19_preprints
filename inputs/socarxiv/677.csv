Employing games to collect data, classify images or even solve major scientific problems is a relatively new but growing phenomenon in citizen science. A main concern in citizen science is to ensure data quality. As games can be seen as having adverse effects on data quality, it is important to understand how citizen scientists produce data using games, how accurate this data can be, and whether and how games influence data quality. 
	
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of individual players’ data quality in MalariaSpot, a citizen science casual game in which volunteers are tasked with detecting parasites in digitized blood sample images.
	
Methods: We used descriptive statistics to analyze a subset of the gameplays recorded and stored in the MalariaSpot database, comparing its clicks to the Gold Standard position of the parasites. This subset includes 15,546 gameplays played over 38 known images that correspond to 97,200 clicks from 1,278 different players. Gameplays have been played via the Android and iOS applications and via the web version of the game. Images were acquired in three different locations and therefore sample preparation have been done by different lab technicians. Two distinct technologies were used for sample digitalization.

Results: The overall values for sensibility, specificity, and accuracy of the individual gameplays for the 38 images are 0.82, 0.60, and 0.29 respectively. High presence of parasites in an image makes it easier for players to detect them as their structures tend to look alike and can be compared. Being a simple casual game, the learning curve is very fast and after few minutes, players attend their typical performance level. Data quality is considerably lower in images acquired with mobile phones coupled to the microscope ocular compared to those digitized with standardized digitalization technologies. 
		 
Conclusions: The results indicate that data quality is influenced by the game, the technologies for image digitalization and the sampling preparation.",TRUE,FALSE,crowdsourcing; malaria; image analysis; games for health,2018-07-02T11:08:10.959516,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-26T12:26:45.417414,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/citation/,vztxn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jztpn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/relationships/node/,jztpn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a066fe9ad5a10253d3be16/,59a066fe9ad5a10253d3be16,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vztxn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vztxn,NA

One approach to alleviating this problem is to teach women about the clitoris. This assumes that women lack information about the clitoris and that knowledge about the clitoris is correlated with orgasm. Using a non-random sample of 833 undergraduate students, our study investigates both assumptions. First, we test the amount of knowledge about the clitoris, the reported sources of this knowledge, and the correlation between citing a source and actual knowledge. Second, we measure the correlation between clitoral knowledge and orgasm in both masturbation and partnered sex. Among a sample of undergraduate students, the most frequently cited sources of clitoral knowledge (school and friends) were associated with the least amount of tested knowledge. The source most likely to correlate with clitoral knowledge (self-exploration) was among the most rarely cited. Despite this, respondents correctly answered, on average, three of the five clitoral knowledge measures. Knowledge correlated significantly with the frequency of women’s orgasm in masturbation but not partnered sex. Our results are discussed in light of gender inequality and a social construction of sexuality, endorsed by both men and women, that privileges men’s sexual pleasure over women’s, such that orgasm for women is pleasing, but ultimately incidental.",TRUE,FALSE,anorgasmia|clitoris|comprehensive sex education|education|friends|gender|gender inequality|knowledge|masturbation|media|orgasm|parents|pornography|sex|sex education|sexuality|sexual knowledge|sexual satisfaction,2018-07-02T11:08:06.826114,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-24T06:04:38.087990,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/citation/,9e6cq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gesy8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/relationships/node/,gesy8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599e6c06594d90004477eb5e/,599e6c06594d90004477eb5e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9e6cq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9e6cq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9e6cq,NA

These require reporters to demonstrate objectivity by counterposing authoritative sources representing opposing sides.  I examine news articles about a topic uncontested in the U.S., female genital cutting (FGC), to complicate our understanding of how reporters do their job.  In contrast to the literature, reporters strike a balance, including the ‘general public’ of FGC-practicing communities extensively.  However, because the balance is confined to non-authoritative speakers ‘over there’, the balance nonetheless serves to stigmatize proponents.  This research shows that the negative portrayal of members of FGC-practicing communities is not only due to their erasure in news coverage. Instead, whether standing translates into influence depends on context, something reporters can manipulate when there is consensus. Likewise, the separation of topics into contested and uncontested erases the ways in which controversy is not a characteristic of issues, but a function of reporter decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,consensus|contention|cultural change|discourse|female circumcision|female genital cutting|female genital mutilation|journalism|media|news|power|reporting|social change,2018-07-02T11:08:06.539044,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-24T05:37:56.006409,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/citation/,4qp6h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4mj5u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/relationships/node/,4mj5u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599e65e29ad5a10255d3287c/,599e65e29ad5a10255d3287c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4qp6h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4qp6h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4qp6h,NA
