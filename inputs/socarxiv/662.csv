They play a major role in translation and contrastive studies, and are also becoming popular in translation training and language teaching, with the advent of the data-driven learning (DDL) approach. Despite their significance, however, Arabic seems to lack a satisfactory general-use parallel corpus resource. The literature describes few Arabic–English parallel corpora, and these few are usually inaccurate and/or expensive. Some are small in size, while others are restricted in terms of genre, failing to meet the requirements of many academics and researchers. This paper describes an ongoing project at the College of Languages and Translation, King Saud University, to compile a 10-million-word Arabic–English parallel corpus to be used as a resource for translation training and language teaching. The bidirectional corpus can be used to compare translated and source language and identify differences.

Today, films are no longer thought of as simple entertainment media but rather educational tools as well. Globalization has contributed greatly to the availability of English-language films and that enriches the source of English learning material dramatically. This research paper explores the effect of using English films in English as foreign language (EFL) classroom. It reveals the effect on developing students’ motivation, comprehension as well as communication skills. The study was carried out on a sample of two groups: an experimental group using films alongside their course book and a control group taught in a conventional way. The participants were classified as pre-intermediate level. The findings of this study have shown that those in the experimental group significantly outperformed their control group counterpart in terms of motivation and language production.

There were two instruments used in the present study, i.e. 1) observation scaling checklist, and 2) questionnaire. The observation scaling checklist was used for assessing the respondents’ performance when they were teaching in class. Meanwhile, the questionnaire using a four-point Likert scale was used to elicit data. The researchers used a series of independent t-test to analyze the data.

Coherence and cohesion is inextricable in which both are crucial in academic writing as to achieve a makes-sense text. Therefore, it is an urgent need to look at the writing competency of students as they are at graduate level, majoring in the English language education. The texts produced by the students were scrutinized through the lens of micro- and macro-level coherence (Thornburry, 2005). From this theory, cohesion is involved in micro level coherence.

However, in recent years, various studies have shown that proper strategies in acquiring new words could be one of the keys to effective language learning among EFL learners. This study investigates how Sudanese EFL learners at Khartoum University, Sudan use and evaluate vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs). The three selected categories of vocabulary learning strategies - metacognitive, discovery, and consolidation - were chosen according to taxonomies proposed by Al-Fuhaid (2004), Schmitt (1997) and Nation (2001).  These VLSs were then evaluated using Han’s Information Processing Theory and Craik and Lockhart’s Depth of Processing Theory (1972) to meet the two objectives of this study. The first objective was to examine the most frequently used VLSs employing a set questionnaire designed to elicit the necessary data. The second objective was to evaluate the usefulness of each of these VLSs by conducting in-depth interviews with the respondents. The results showed that metacognitive strategies were the most frequently used VLS among the three. In-depth interview data revealed that respondents evaluated all three VLS positively and considered them very useful in acquiring as well as understanding words. These findings suggest that language learners in Sudan should be taught vocabulary enhancing techniques while language instructors should use and teach these VLS to learners explicitly.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language|vocabulary learning|vocabulary learning strategies,2018-07-02T11:15:53.904846,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T00:02:43.591202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/citation/,qpn8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w7hfv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/relationships/node/,w7hfv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3f633594d9002b0c5e223/,59e3f633594d9002b0c5e223,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qpn8t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qpn8t

However, this relationship remained under-explored. This study would address two key research questions: (1) How did learners of English as a foreign language paraphrase texts and (2) How were their attitudes towards plagiarism. Data were drawn from texts produced by undergraduate students of English Department in reading comprehension classes. Two stages of analyses were carried out. Firstly description of quality of paraphrasing the texts by the learners were presented and distributed. Secondly, the learners’ attitudes towards plagiarism were described. These analyses were used as starting point to interpret the student plagiarism. Findings and discussion revealed that 20% of the learners’ works were 100% unique. They agreed to say that plagiarizing was as bad as stealing an exam and that plagiarism impoverished the investigative spirit. The rest were plagiarized ranging from 5% up to 24%. They said that sometimes they felt tempted to plagiarize because so many other students were doing it.  They argued sometimes they copied a sentence or two just to become inspired for further writing. Pedagogically, it implies that since paraphrasing is using one’s own words to express someone else's ideas, students should be encouraged to cite a source accurately and define unfamiliar words instead of being punished. They need to change any words or phrases that match the original so closely.

This study aims to investigate the students’ attitudes towards questioning strategies of critical reading skills among Jordanian female ninth-grade students in Al Qaser Directorate of Education. A semi-structured interview instrument was used to assess students’ attitudes. Data were collected from students at three public schools located in Qaser, Karak, Jordan. A total of 85 students participated in this present study. The sample which includes interviewees was 15 students. Overall, students showed favorable attitudes towards questioning strategies. However, some students faced some challenges by using these strategies e.g. self- questioning strategy. In light of these results, several recommendations were suggested to the Ministry of Education, English teachers and other researchers.

The study was conducted in Soran town, in the northern part of Iraq. The participants of the study were 58 EFL teachers from secondary and high school classrooms. In the first phase, a five-point Likert-scale questionnaire was administered (Karavas-Doukas, 1996) to examine the participants’ attitudes towards CLT principles: “place/importance of grammar, group/pair work, quality and quantity of error correction, the role of the teacher in the classroom, the role and contribution of learners in the learning process.” The second phase of the study was qualitative and consisted of semi-structured interviews to examine the reasons behind the implementation of CLT in terms of the factors that hinder and encourage the implementation of CLT in the Iraqi setting. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that the teachers held overall positive attitudes towards the use of CLT. The findings of the interview phase concluded that the main factors that cause the failure and success of the implementation of CLT in Iraq can be categorized under four headings: educational factors, teacher factors, student factors, and CLT factors. The results of the study suggest that the educational system and the teachers’ communicative competence are essential to promote the employment of CLT in Iraqi EFL classrooms.",TRUE,FALSE,CLT|communicative competence|Iraq|teachers’ attitudes,2018-07-02T11:15:53.751011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-15T23:51:28.078563,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/citation/,3pnh9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5m9ut/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/relationships/node/,5m9ut,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3f3c79ad5a102b489ca75/,59e3f3c79ad5a102b489ca75,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pnh9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pnh9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pnh9

However, its use is quite restricted in the Algerian secondary school. Thus, instead of playing a formative role, the assessment found in the Algerian EFL classroom is of a summative nature. Accordingly, the purpose behind the current research is to shed light on the importance of formative assessment in the teaching and learning processes by highlighting its effect on text comprehension, as the latter may be an obstacle to effective language learning and academic achievement among Algerian secondary school pupils. To reach this end, the present research attempts to investigate the impact of formative assessment on pupils’ text comprehension as well as their achievement and attitudes through answering the following research questions: (1) how does formative assessment develop pupils’ text comprehension? (2) What changes can the experiment bring in terms of students’ achievements and attitudes towards text comprehension? This research is based on a quasi-experimental design delivered to sixteen third year secondary school pupils as the latter are required to sit for the ‘Baccalaureate’ exam in which text comprehension is of crucial importance. A pretest, a posttest, an intervention which lasted five weeks and a questionnaire were used to find out the impact of formative assessment on the development of pupil’s text comprehension. The results obtained showed a significant progress in pupils’ outcomes in the four language competences: grammatical, textual, functional and sociolinguistic and namely in grammatical and textual competences. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that formative assessment should be an integral part of the teaching process.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:15:53.696844,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-15T23:47:06.883443,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/citation/,6hr58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4k8a5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/relationships/node/,4k8a5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3f2c1594d9002b1c6a8c3/,59e3f2c1594d9002b1c6a8c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hr58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6hr58/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6hr58
