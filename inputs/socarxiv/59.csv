The main objectives of the research are to specify the role of artistic values for people, represent the methodology for the integration of arts into foreign language classes, evaluate its results. The research questions of the study aimed to investigate how the experimental course contributed to students’ attitude towards artistic values, the development of their language and communication skills. The outlined methodology of arts integration into foreign language classes involves teaching art terms, phraseological units about art, popular-quotations, and teaching through literary translation and dialogue of cultures. The one-term experimental integrated course of English and art classes was implemented by two secondary schools in Kyiv (Ukraine). The evaluation of the results was done with the method of qualitative research.

Khaled Mattawa’s fifth collection of poems, Mare Nostrum (2019), discusses the twenty-first-century refugee crisis in the Mediterranean through the effects of economics and environmental destruction on both humans and marine ecosystems alike. This paper aims to examine the Mediterranean migrant tragedy’s entanglement with its ecological crisis in Mattawa’s poems. The study seeks to answer the question: can an analysis of Mare Nostrum (2019) illustrate a parallel between humans’ oppression and the environment? A postcolonial ecocritical lens can explore this connection by looking at the “changing relationship between people, animals, and environment . . . that can be recuperated for anticolonial critique” (Huggan and Tiffin 12). The study’s significance exists in showing the destructive impact of political crises that extend beyond human displacement to become an ecological issue that threatens marine ecosystems.

Significantly, the themes of insanity and murder are not ideal from an esthetic perspective, but for Browning and Lowell it provides the key to probe into human character and fundamental motives. This study examines Browning’ and Lowell’s dramatic monologues that address crime and the psyche of abnormal men. Browning’ and Lowell’s poetry in this regard unravels complicated human motivations and delineates morbid psychologies. Their monologues probe deep down into the mind-sets of their characters and dissect their souls to the readers. The main character of each of Browning’s dramatic monologues, My Last Duchess and Porphyria’s Lover; discloses his true self, mental health, and moral values through his monologue in a critical situation. Ironically, each monologue invites the reader to detect the disparity between what the character believes the story to be and the reality of the situation detected through the poem. In Lowell’s The Mills of the Kavanaughs, the monologue is delivered by the victim herself.

Saadawi’s Frankenstein in Baghdad is similarly a work of great significance that won the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2014. Since its release, the name ‘Frankenstein’ attached to Baghdad, as a novel title in the mid of the American occupation of Iraq (2005) and its connection to a universal Frankenstein, has been inspiring to the Iraqis and world fiction lovers. What remains essential about this fascination among the readers is in the questions of how and what is the connection between both works. Therefore, this paper attempts to discover the roots of the concept of creation behind Shelley’s Frankenstein in 1818 and Ahmed Saadawi’s Frankenstein in Baghdad in 2013 from mythology, theology, science, and political reality of Iraq. Besides, the linear evolution in the concept of creation throughout the mentioned areas will be displayed to unfold the origins that lie behind these colossal novels. Understanding that lineage development in the concept and the disputes around it is of great significance to the reader which can empower them to contextualize the novels since apprehending new context is a vital factor for appropriation and intertexuality.

These themes have been taken up by many authors of African American origin. This paper attempts to represent and explain the theme of alienation through an in-depth analysis of Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. The crisis of identity, gender, consciousness, and everything seemingly comes to question in the powerful narratives of these kinds of writings. One such African American author is Maya Angelou. She is one of those who take these themes with great force and tries to free herself from the shackles of the so-called canonized versions of human values and seeks to explore a world in which she recreates an establishment of her new perspectives and freedom of humanity.

Specifically, it is intended to scrutinize how Drabble’s language style vivifies her representation of some women characters’ perplexity and predicament when they are confronted with problems related to value orientations and lifestyles. The present paper’s significance lies in a methodological breakthrough and resultant interdisciplinary insights. To achieve the main aims specified above, this paper will explore the following research question: stylistically, how some lexical categories such as nouns, verbs, and clusters are related to the spatio-temporal order of the novel and to its discourse prosodies or “tone of characters” speeches. As a whole, this study is situated in a research context where previous and many current studies of A Summer Bird-Cage are primarily qualitative. To complement them, this paper embodies mixed methods research, featuring in a computer-aided, data-based, corpus stylistic approach to the style in Drabble’s novel. Based on a multi-layered investigation of Drabble’s language use and a close corpus stylistic analysis of it, this paper obtains some interesting findings as follows. First, some young, educated British women’s complicated psychological experiences are thematized via narratorial introspection that centers around characters’ processing of mind.

This paper uses the textual analysis method to explore Leila Aboulela as a writer with a sophisticated commitment to Islam who strives to counteract the biased perception of Islam and Muslims. Drawing on the views of Wail Hassan, the study focuses on Leila Aboulela’s novel The Kindness of Enemie to examine the author’s concern of Muslims’ image in the west after the 9/11 terrorist attack and its impact on Muslims, particularly the immigrants. It argues that Aboulela uses Imam Shamil as a metaphor to debunk the terrorist attacks that target innocent people under the pretext of Islam, and on the other hand, setting a good example of the concept of jihad. The findings show that Aboulela’s primary concern is to condemn terrorist operations against innocent people worldwide. To illustrate her views, the author uses two contrasted pictures, the historical story of Imam Shamil, who embodies the proper jihadist/resistance vis-à-vis with the current so-called jihadists. The study further shows that those terrorist acts have significantly impacted Muslims’ lives and are the first cause of contemporary racism, islamophobia, and the sense of loss among Muslim immigrants in the west.",TRUE,FALSE,islamophobia|Leila Aboulela|Muslim immigrants|other|terrorist|The Kindness of Enemies,2021-03-17T19:42:45.152429,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:42:30.929576,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/citation/,xmnr8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60516f0eae403d00ca979e85/,60516f0eae403d00ca979e85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xmnr8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xmnr8/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xmnr8

Drawing on cultural and feminist discourse, the study seeks to examine Disney’s live-action film for incidents of cultural appropriation of gender representation compared to Villeneuve’s fairy tale and Disney’s 1991 animated version. The Study argues that the 2017 film adaptation reverses the traditional patriarchal notions and embraces a transgressive feminist discourse/approach as part of Disney’s strategy of diversity and inclusion of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation as constantly evolving cultural categories.  This study finds significant alterations made to the physical and psychological attributes of the 2017 film’s three characters: Beauty/Belle, the Beast, and the Enchantress, changes that align with the film’s gendered discourse. By reversing the characteristic privileging of the male and the empowerment of the female, the live-action succeeds in addressing the contemporary audience demands of diversity and inclusion. The study concludes that the changes made in the 2017 film adaptation displace the oppressive patriarchal notions and stereotypical modes of representing the male and female as they have been perceived in the original fairy tale, for they are no longer compatible with contemporary cultures’ assumptions on gender.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|Beauty and the Beast|cultural studies|de Villeneuve|Disney|gendered discourse,2021-03-17T19:43:00.875898,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:42:47.667851,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/citation/,g2jnc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60516df35ca6c700bc78b65b/,60516df35ca6c700bc78b65b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g2jnc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g2jnc/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g2jnc
