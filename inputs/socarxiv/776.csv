numbers to patent nanotechnology inventions. This rush to the patent office
is so significant that many law firms have established nanotechnology
practice groups, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has now created a
new technology class designed to track nanotechnology products. Three big
differences between the emerging science of nanotechnology and other
inventions make the role of patents more significant here than elsewhere.
First, this is the first new field in a century in which people started
patenting the basic ideas at the outset. In most other fields of invention
over the past century - computer hardware, software, biotechnology, the
Internet - the basic building blocks of the field were unpatented. In
nanotech, by contrast, companies and universities alike are patenting early
and often. A second factor driving the importance of patents in
nanotechnology is its unique cross-industry structure. Unlike other new
industries, in which the patentees are largely actual or at least potential
participants in the market, a significant number of nanotechnology
patentees will own rights not just in the industry in which they
participate, but in other industries as well. This may significantly affect
their incentives to license the patents. Finally, a large number of the
basic patents have issued to universities, who have become far more active
in patenting in the last 25 years. While universities have no direct
incentive to restrict competition, their interests may or may not align
with the optimal implementation of building-block nanotechnology inventions.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:08.844128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:49:10.963000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/citation/,2q9n4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bsg3r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/relationships/node/,bsg3r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bdde18b83f6901f8656276/,57bdde18b83f6901f8656276,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2q9n4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2q9n4

century to figure out why we protect trade secrets. The puzzle is not in
understanding what trade secret law covers; there seems to be widespread
agreement on the basic contours of the law. Nor is the problem that people
object to the effects of the law. Rather, the puzzle is a theoretical one:
no one can seem to agree where trade secret law comes from or how to fit it
into the broader framework of legal doctrine. Courts, lawyers, scholars,
and treatise writers argue over whether trade secrets are a creature of
contract, of tort, of property, or even of criminal law. None of these
different justifications have proven entirely persuasive. Worse, they have
contributed to inconsistent treatment of the basic elements of a trade
secret cause of action, and uncertainty as to the relationship between
trade secret laws and other causes of action. Robert Bone has gone so far
as to suggest that this theoretical incoherence suggests that there is no
need for trade secret law as a separate doctrine at all.

In this article, I suggest that trade secrets can be justified as a form,
not of traditional property, but of intellectual property (IP). The
incentive justification for encouraging new inventions is straightforward.
Granting legal protection for those new inventions not only encourages
their creation, but enables an inventor to sell her idea. And while we have
other laws that encourage inventions, notably patent law, trade secrecy
offers some significant advantages for inventors over patent protection.

It seems odd, though, for the law to encourage secrets, or to encourage
only those inventions that are kept secret. I argue that, paradoxically,
trade secret law is actually designed to encourage disclosure, not secrecy.
Without legal protection, companies in certain industries would invest too
much in keeping secrets. Trade secret law develops as a substitute for the
physical and contractual restrictions those companies would otherwise
impose in an effort to prevent a competitor from acquiring their
information.

The puzzle then becomes why the law would require secrecy as an element of
the cause of action if its goal is to reduce secrecy. I argue that the
secrecy requirement serves a channeling function. Only the developers of
some kinds of inventions have the option to over-invest in physical secrecy
in the absence of legal protection. For products that are inherently
self-disclosing (the wheel, say, or the paper clip), trying to keep the
idea secret is a lost cause. We don't need trade secret law to encourage
disclosure of inherently self-disclosing products - inventors of such
products will get patent protection or nothing. But if trade secret law
prevented the use of ideas whether or not they were secret, the result
would be less, not more, diffusion of valuable information. The secrecy
requirement therefore serves a gatekeeper function, ensuring that the law
encourages disclosure of information that would otherwise be kept secret,
while channeling inventors of self-disclosing products to the patent
system.

My argument has a number of implications for trade secret policy. First,
the theory works only if we treat trade secrets as an IP right, requiring
proof of secrecy as an element of protection. If we give the protection to
things that are public, we defeat the purpose and give windfalls to people
who may not be inventors (what we might call ""trade secret trolls""). Courts
that think of trade secret law as a common law tort rather than an IP right
are apt to overlook the secrecy requirement in their zeal to reach ""bad
actors."" Second, an IP theory of trade secrets also encourages preemption
of ""unjust enrichment"" theories and other common-law ways courts are
tempted to give private parties legal control over information in the
public domain. Thus, an IP theory of trade secrets is in part a ""negative""
one: the value of trade secret law lies in part in defining the boundaries
of the cause of action and preempting others that might reach too far.
Finally, treating trade secrets as IP rights helps secure their place in
the pantheon of legal protection for inventions. The traditional conception
of the tradeoff between patents and trade secrets views the disclosure
function of the patent system as one of its great advantages over trade
secret law. And indeed the law operates in various ways to encourage
inventors to choose patent over trade secret protection where both are
possible. But for certain types of inventions we may actually get more
useful ""disclosure"" at less cost from trade secret than from patent law.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:08.876522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:48:04.725000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/citation/,srz5t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8ndka/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/relationships/node/,8ndka,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bdddd6594d9001ffd0e16b/,57bdddd6594d9001ffd0e16b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srz5t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/srz5t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/srz5t

are facilitated because the Hatch-Waxman Act has been interpreted to give
180 days of generic exclusivity to the first generic company to file for
FDA approval, whether or not that company succeeds in invalidating the
patent or finding a way to avoid infringement. As a result, the patentee
can “buy off” the first generic entrant, paying them to delay their entry
into the market while still offering them the valuable period of generic
exclusivity. And if that first generic is entitled to its 180 days, no one
else can enter until after the exclusivity period has expired or been
forfeited. The result is that the 180-day exclusivity period is not serving
its purpose of eliminating weak patents. True, it is encouraging lots of
challenges to those patents. But it is encouraging the challengers to
accept compensation to drop those challenges, rather than taking them to
judgment and benefiting the rest of the world.

We propose a change to the Hatch-Waxman statutory scheme. Our alternative
is straightforward: first-filing generic drug companies should be entitled
to 180 days of exclusivity only if they successfully defeat the patent
owner, for example, by invalidating the patent or by proving that they did
not infringe that patent. The point of 180-day exclusivity was to encourage
challenges to patents because the invalidation of bad patents benefits
society as a whole. Society doesn’t benefit from a private deal to drop a
challenge. That doesn’t mean settlement is never a good idea; it is a
commonplace in our legal system. But it seems bizarre to insulate a company
from competition just because it settles the case. Indeed, we expect that
our proposal, if implemented, would facilitate more rational settlements,
in which the settlements that result accurately reflect the likelihood of
success in litigation.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:43.722700,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:45:43.356000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/citation/,n32y8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wfz9z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/relationships/node/,wfz9z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bddd48594d9001fad0defc/,57bddd48594d9001fad0defc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n32y8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n32y8

protection to all kinds of technologies. However, we have recently noticed
an increasing divergence between the rules actually applied to different
industries. Biotechnology provides one of the best examples. In
biotechnology cases, the Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that
uncertainty in predicting the structural features of biotechnological
inventions renders them nonobvious, even if the prior art demonstrates a
clear plan for producing the invention. At the same time, the court claims
that the uncertain nature of the technology requires imposition of
stringent patent enablement and written description requirements that are
not applied to patents in other disciplines. Thus, as a practical matter it
appears that although patent law is technology-neutral in theory, it is
technology-specific in application. Much of the variance in patent
standards is attributable to the use of a legal construct, the ""person
having ordinary skill in the art"" (PHOSITA), to determine obviousness and
enablement. We do not challenge the idea that the standards in each
industry should vary with the level of skill in that industry. We think the
use of the PHOSITA provides needed flexibility for patent law, permitting
it to adapt to new technologies without losing its essential character. We
fear, however, that the Federal Circuit has not applied that standard
properly in biotechnology. The court has a static perception of the field
that was set in its initial analyses of biotechnology inventions, but which
does not reflect the realities of the industry. In the final part of the
paper, we offer a very preliminary policy assessment of these
industry-specific patent cases. We suggest that the special rules the
Federal Circuit has constructed for biotech cases are rather poorly matched
to the specific needs of the industry. Indeed, in some ways the Federal
Circuit cases have it exactly backwards. We offer a few suggestions as to

twenty years. While these patents are spread across all industries, a large
percentage are concentrated in the information technology (IT) industries,
and others in biotechnology. The prevalence of patents in these industries
has caused a number of people to worry about an ""anticommons"" in patent
law. Given these problems, it's a wonder companies make products in
patent-intensive industries at all.

And yet make products they do. Both my own experience and what limited
empirical evidence there is suggest that companies do not seem much
deterred by the threat of all this patent litigation from making products.

What's going on here? The answer, I think, is quite simple: both
researchers and companies in component industries simply ignore patents.
Virtually everyone does it. They do it at all stages of endeavor. From the
perspective of an outsider to the patent system, this is a remarkable fact.
And yet it may be what prevents the patent system from crushing innovation
in component industries like IT. Ignoring patents, then, may be a
""workaround"" that allows the innovation system to function in the face of
overbroad patent protection.

exclude business methods - or any technology - from the patent law. It also
rejected as the sole test of subject matter eligibility the Federal
Circuit’s deeply-flawed ""machine or transformation"" test, under which no
process is patentable unless it is tied to a particular machine or
transforms an article to another state or thing. Subsequent developments
threaten to undo that holding, however. Relying on the Court’s description
of the Federal Circuit test as a ""useful and important clue', the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, patent litigants, and district courts have all

Bilski: no longer as the sole rule, but as a presumptive starting point
that threatens to effectively become mandatory. In this Article, we suggest
a new way to understand the exclusion of abstract ideas from patentable
subject matter. No class of invention is inherently too abstract for
patenting. Rather, the rule against patenting abstract ideas is an effort
to prevent inventors from claiming their ideas too broadly. By requiring
that patent claims be limited to a specific set of practical applications
of an idea, the abstract ideas doctrine both makes the scope of the
resulting patent clearer and leaves room for subsequent inventors to
improve upon - and patent new applications of - the same basic principle.
Recasting the abstract ideas doctrine as an overclaiming test eliminates
the constraints of the artificial machine-or-transformation test, as well
as the pointless effort to fit inventions into permissible or impermissible
categories. It also helps understand some otherwise-inexplicable
distinctions in the case law. Testing for overclaiming allows courts to
focus on what really matters: whether the scope of the patentee's claims
are commensurate with the invention’s practical, real-world contribution.

These were driven by falling mortality rates across all age groups, but initially mostly amongst the young. Using ONS mid-year population and deaths estimates for Local Authorities for England and Wales, we show that these improvements have recently reversed. There have been especially high increases in mortality rates within the elderly, a group which we choose to focus our analyses on. In England and Wales, we estimate that there were 39,074 more deaths in the year to July 2015 as compared to the year to July 2014 (32,208 of these additional deaths were of individuals aged 80+). Exploring changes in mortality rates by 5 year age band and sex, we demonstrate that these increases have been felt everywhere geographically; in poor and affluent areas, in rural and urban areas. We explore some possible explanations for the increases and find that few individual factors on their own appear able to explain the patterns we observe. The implications of our findings are profound given what has come before them, combined with the current political climate of austerity. The size, scale and lack of spatial pattern in these changes in 2015 (particularly in comparison to previous years) suggests that something wider is occurring at the population level than simply a one-off event.
