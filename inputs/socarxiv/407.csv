Prior computational analyses attempting to analyze these elements have primarily relied on summarizing relatively low-level features. Beginning with the early work of Barry Salt, one particularly prominent metric is the distribution of median shot lengths. Works on shot length include Yuri Tsivian's Cinemetrics project, Arclight, and Jeremy Butler's ShotLogger. Other computational analyses examine the aggregation of language and average shot color, image compositions, and analysis of film scripts. These projects have demonstrated the feasibility of distributing extracted metadata from copyrighted materials and the power of computational techniques in accessing useful information over a large collection of moving images. However, there is much to be learned from other extractable metadata beyond shot detection and much to be studied in audiovisual media that can only be discovered through computer vision.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-06T22:37:42.120466,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-06T22:37:04.522682,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/citation/,8e3fj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d487650ac87f30019a5fec1/,5d487650ac87f30019a5fec1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8e3fj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8e3fj/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.043,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8e3fj

This paper identifies a fourth: transitional temporality. This approach is inspired by Polanyi's (1944) comparative analysis of the rate of change of economic transformation surrounding the respective commodification of land and labor. Following Polanyi, transitional temporality focuses not on the endpoints of social transformation (as in teleological approaches), nor on moments of transformation (as in eventful approaches), but on the potentially lengthy transitions between structures. While eventful temporality equates agency with the choices made by individuals during relatively rare events, transitional temporality identifies the capacity for agents to alter the rate of change and, in so doing, to prevent or bring about events. This approach recovers Polanyi's oft-ignored analysis of the state's role in modulating the rate of change and foregrounds the social costs of disruption and dislocation resulting from abrupt transitions.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-06T22:36:25.167682,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-06T22:36:09.386794,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,Daniel Hirschman,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/citation/,tuz8p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d486e6390489f001a4b436b/,5d486e6390489f001a4b436b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tuz8p/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tuz8p

Using nearly four years of data on shooting victimizations in Philadelphia we test whether distance to the nearest level 1 trauma center is associated with victim survival. We employ different distance measures based on street network distances, drive-time estimates, and Euclidean distance - comparing the predictive accuracy of each.

It uses a sequential logit model to study the changing impact of family background on educational transitions and educational attainment, comparing birth cohorts that completed their schooling during different stages of the market transition process. Data are derived from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a large and nationally representative household survey that provides detailed retrospective information. The findings show that in reform-era China educational inequality has increased despite large-scale educational expansion. Since the onset of the market reforms the importance of social origin has continuously increased, particularly at the crucial transition to senior high school.

The problems we are referring to are associated to a particular case study in the Mayan area of Yucatan. In this place, where groundwater is the only source of freshwater, the inhabitants have to deal with water problems such as resource scarcity, groundwater pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource degradation. Further, it revealed that one way to improve conservation is to ensure the inclusion of cultural values between people and their environment and this is of significance for evolving strong relations with nature. We examined socio-ecological groundwater relations in contemporary Mayan society by analysing how the ancient Maya obtained freshwater, and how and why contemporary local Mayan communities of Yucatan, Mexico, have transformed the groundwater system by intensify groundwater pollution problems. Several authors have attempted to improve the understanding of complex processes underlying the Maya collapse, and the interactions of this society with nature. But, if the demise of the Mayan populations in the past was the result of complex social and ecological factors, then what are those relations, at present, and how they are conceptualized? What kind of government regulation is necessary, and how can communities make decisions to ensure solutions for conservation, at a time when cultural values, worldviews and traditional practices are being lost? To answer those questions, we review the background to the groundwater problem, and the historical and cultural context of Yucatan groundwater system. We use the Mayan society as a case study to elucidate this and of the induced collapse, exacerbated by the overuse of natural resources in a non- sustainable way. Nevertheless, a very complex traditional ecological knowledge and general worldview of the use of natural resources in Yucatan have significantly shaped the socio-environmental conditions in the region, in particular freshwater resources.",TRUE,FALSE,common pool resources|groundwater|Mayas|social-ecological system framework|Yucatan,2019-08-05T12:49:22.679753,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-05T12:49:04.894736,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/citation/,6nfwz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4754ff26ebf5001888103c/,5d4754ff26ebf5001888103c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6nfwz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6nfwz

It also explores students' perception of Digital Storytelling. This quasi-experimental study involved 52 Form four students from a fully-residential school in Melaka who were chosen using convenient sampling as part of the controlled and experimental groups. Data were collected from pre-tests, post-tests and a semi-structured interview. The quantitative data were analyzed using mean analysis, Wilcoxon Signed Tank Test and Independent t-Test while qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings show that there is a significant difference in the score before and after the intervention but there is no significant difference between the score of the experimental group and the controlled group.

This paper argues that U-learning represents a new perspective in terms of pedagogy. The main contributor to this process is foremost the teacher, who has to adhere to the ever-changing language learning/teaching scenery. This study aims at setting the fundamentals of materials development at the intersection of two major areas of contemporary education, namely the needs of the ‘net generation’ students and the educational potential of the evolving social web and digital technology. It seeks to answer the following questions: What is digital technology and how does it lead to U-learning? What is web 2.0 and how does it affect classroom pedagogy, practice, and the design of quality teaching/learning materials? How does it help teachers improve their practice and materials development procedures? And how can teachers transform today’s innovative technology into ubiquitous learning experiences, promoting learner autonomy, regardless of any geographical or institutional boundaries?

For that sake and in an attempt to answer our research questions: What are the barriers that hinder EFL written expression teachers from the integration of CALL in their teaching practices? What recommendations can be given to overcome these barriers? Therefore, the quantitative questionnaire was used as a main research tool. It is chosen to elicit the participants’ perceptions, perspectives, and viewpoints. The research sample includes a number of seven participants of those who are teaching or had previously taught this module. The statistical results highlight the conclusion that the respondents’ most reported CALL barriers are extrinsic rather than being intrinsic. They mainly include: English as Foreign Language (EFL) teachers’ resistance to change, lack of technical support, lack of training, and insufficient time in the Written Expression session.",TRUE,FALSE,CALL|challenges|innovative teaching methodologies|reforms,2019-08-04T20:50:27.365170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:50:03.791312,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/citation/,fz2m4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4740fdbcd6d9001692abfb/,5d4740fdbcd6d9001692abfb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fz2m4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fz2m4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.20,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fz2m4

It also investigated EFL students' attitudes, motivation, and anxiety towards learning English via WhatsApp. The sample comprised 55 male and female students studying English at the College of Arts, University of Bisha, Saudi Arabia. A closed-ended questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from the sample. The results revealed that WhatsApp has a positive impact on learning English as a foreign language with a score of 3.9 as an overall mean. Students’ attitudes towards using WhatsApp for learning English scored 3.4, while the impact of WhatsApp on motivating EFL students to study English scored 3.6 in total. It was also found that WhatsApp reduced students’ anxiety with a score of 3.8 as the overall mean. Based on these results, the researchers suggest that WhatsApp should be activated at all stages of English language learning and teaching.",TRUE,FALSE,anxiety|attitudes|English language learning|mobile language learning (MLL)|motivation|WhatsApp,2019-08-04T20:50:45.438414,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:50:31.929242,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/citation/,jbzk9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d473faa3ce935001aee2c5a/,5d473faa3ce935001aee2c5a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbzk9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jbzk9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jbzk9
