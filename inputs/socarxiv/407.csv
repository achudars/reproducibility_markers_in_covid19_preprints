It has aimed to understand the role of stylistics analysis in shaping the meanings of literary texts. In addition to explain how cohesion can contribute to interpreting and understanding poetry. The significant of the study is based on the fact that it contributes to the understanding of how linguistic and stylistic analysis of a text can be used, extensively, to clarify features and meanings in texts. Nine poems were selected to represent Wordsworth poetry. The poems were selected randomly. Cohesive devices were identified in the poems and analyzed using the content analysis technique. They were analyzed quantitatively. The analysis revealed a number of interesting results, namely: All types of cohesive devices were used in the poems selected for the purpose of the study (reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and lexical cohesion). There were some variations in the use of some devices; in that certain devices were used at a very high rate of frequency compared to others. The main function of the use of cohesive devices within the poems was to help the poet express romantic values. Based on the results obtained, the study suggests the following: First, it would be interesting, for further studies to conduct more studies on the coherence of English literary discourse.

The present paper aims at accentuating the way(s) diverse socio-cultural configurations can impinge on translators’ strategy of literalism. With this objective in mind, the paper probes Arberry’s translation venture in approaching Imru al Qays’ Mu’allaqa by investigating the pivotal roles culture and ideology fulfill in maneuvering the translator’s word choice. The approach adopted while investigating such postulation is a critical discourse analysis perspective steeped in Van Dijk’s (2004) model of probing ideologies to six of al-Mu’allaqa’s most culturally challenging lines of verse.

Victorian literature is usually read against the relationship between art and reality. The literary merit of a book is determined by the degree of its conformity with the moral values of the time. This paper offers a detached reading of the novel where the value of the book is found in its ability to initiate the reader into an aesthetic world. The research argues that Wilde fragments the act of artistic creation among the artist (the painter Basil), the sitter (Dorian Gray) and the audience (Lord Henry Wotton). This fragmentation renders the novel aesthetically autonomous from its reality.

However, at the very beginning novelists seem to support the victimization of Americans and accuse the Muslims but later, many voices, including Muslim as well as non-Muslim writers, contribute through giving a voice to the ‘enemy’, and the American novelist Jess Walter is no exception. This analytical study, then, aims at providing evidence that Walter portrays Muslim characters in his work The Zero (2006) and that he does so to deconstruct the idea that Americans are totally innocent and victims while Muslims are the only entity to blame. The present paper, thus, is an attempt to pinpoint that through depicting several characters, including American and Middle Eastern ones, as reacting to the dominating ‘truth’, Walter seems to be giving a voice to the voiceless and providing readers with a different version of reality.

The identity of the American subject should be investigated in the light of his/her restless search of “Other modes of freedom” and imaginary homelands.  -Pondering upon this, the researcher realizes that three fundamental questions need to be addressed: What are the aspects of Henderson's spiritual quest?  -As a Jewish hero, how could Henderson be associated with quest, victimization and madness?  Can one think about identity or identities?  To unmask these blind spots, the theme of the quest will be investigated, first.  The researcher shall trace Henderson's movement from a material world – New York – to a spiritual and romantic one, Africa.  Second, Henderson's failure to cope with the new world and therefore his failure to (re) – construct the identity of the American character will be examined in details.  This safely allows us to argue for the madness of the hero.  The conclusion is that there is no ‘absolute identity’ to the American subject.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to investigate the role of subtitling and dubbing in vocabulary acquisition has been carried out in the Arab world. The aim of the present study is to measure the effect of Audiovisual Translation modalities, mainly subtitling and dubbing, in the acquisition of Arabic vocabulary in an Arabic as a foreign language class (AFL) carried out at Sultan Qaboos College for Teaching Arabic For Non-Native Speakers. In order to do this a couple of questions needed answers 1) Which modality (subtitling and/or dubbing) is more conducive to vocabulary acquisition in the Arabic language? And 2) Which modality is more efficient in the long-term memory retention of Arabic vocabulary? Thirty upper intermediate students participated in this case study, which involved them watching a four-minute clip of the American TV series Designated Survivor in three versions: (a) subtitled into Arabic, (b) dubbed into Arabic, and (c) dubbed and subtitled in Arabic.

This paper carefully examines the most widely-read translations of particle هل as held up through the Quran. It is a critique of the translation of the Quran. Contrary to the long-standing concept which perceives هل as solely an interrogative particle, this paper crosses t’s and dots i’s in relation to focusing translators’ attention on other almost-overlooked linguistic functions carried by هل, i.e. corroborative, negative and imperative. It is found that particle هل in all contexts is dealt with from the same perspective in the translations. This entails the translators’ failure to understand the inconsistent linguistic behaviors of هل. This paper has put efforts to plumb the depths of identifying the different functions expressed by هل, which have long stood in the face of translators, a knotty problem that has long escaped the notice of translators, and thus yielded inaccurate renditions of the هل.

As an unmarried female sovereign and being cognizant of her vulnerability, she employed a discourse of contradiction, an instrumental political asset to challenge Renaissance gender expectations. The discrepancy in Elizabeth’s rhetoric is evident in her speeches, prayers, and poetry. This research suggests that the process of self- representation was carefully and skillfully attained through the projection of conflicting depictions. It explores three erratic depictions: masculine and feminine, virgin and mother, and divine and human. This project provides evidence that in her struggle with her gender and with the Renaissance culture, Elizabeth's rhetorical strategy was the creation of paradoxical images, arguing that this clever tactic allowed her to circumvent the issue of gender, legitimize her rule, and craft a unique regal identity.

Research in translating social media posts has recently received a greater attention among translation studies specialists. This paper looks firstly at Twitter as a growing social media networking and its language and, secondly, shedding some light on translation strategies used in translating English tweets into Arabic. Posts on Twitter, ‘tweets,’ by well-known figures are followed, translated, and reposted in other languages every day. Strategies used by Arab translators vary depending on the importance of the tweet as well as the ideology of the translator and the institutions they work for. This paper, therefore, investigates the translation strategies adopted by the Arab online news agencies, mentioned later, on their web pages in translating some tweets posted by the American President, Donald Trump in his first month of presidency. The analysis draws on Vinay and Darbelnet’s (1958/1995) model and Nida’s (1964) translation strategies.",TRUE,FALSE,Online news|social media|translation model|translation strategies|Twitter,2019-07-25T19:06:21.018613,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:06:11.604552,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/citation/,xntya,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f41d18d5d98001c310e5d/,5c6f41d18d5d98001c310e5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntya/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xntya/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xntya

Poetical Translation of Poetry (English-Arabic),"The translation of poetry has been and will continue to be an issue of great concern to translators, men of letters and readers. Poetry has been approached differently by translators. They are divided into two major parties: tone insists on translating poetry into poetry with respect to all prosodic features; another suggests translating sense with no concern in prosody, especially rhyme, rhm, meter and foot, especially when the translator is for some good reason, unable to translate a poem into a poen in the target language(TL). Each party has their own justifications for their claim. This Paper attempts to demonstrate the merits and demerits  of both approaches at translating one and the same poem in terms of poetic translation for the former, and poetical translation for the latter. The aim behind that is two fold: first to satisfy all types of readers; second, to provide concrete evidence for the argument put forward throughout the whole Paper, which is poetic translation is superceding poetical translation in Arabic for Arab readers who still highly appreciate the aestheticity and poeticity of poetry. At the end of the day, it is left to readers to decide which version to prefer. At times, more than one poetic version of translation are suggested for the same poem by different translators. Still on one or two occasions, a middle way version combining some features of each of poetical and poetic translations, is proposed. It is termed as a ‘semi-poetic’ translation, with the ultimate objective of drawing a comparison between the different versions of translation of the same poem to give readers the opportunity to judge for themselves which translation they go for and why. Convincing readers is a daunting ask, but rewarding at the end. This pproach is applied to the translation of five English poems into Arabic.",TRUE,FALSE,Foot|poetic|poetical|poetry|prosodic features|rhyme|rhythm|translation,2019-07-25T19:05:44.576290,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:05:22.868149,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/citation/,r4mxa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f407a62c82a0019d8458c/,5c6f407a62c82a0019d8458c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4mxa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r4mxa/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r4mxa
