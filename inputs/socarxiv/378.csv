However, it is hard to measure this intangible asset appropriately. Standard economic models mostly rely on common measures such as enrollment rates and international test scores. However, these proxies focus rather on the quality of education of pupils than on the distribution of knowledge among the whole population, which is increasingly defined by alternative sources of education such as online learning platforms. As a consequence, the economically relevant stock of knowledge in a region is only roughly approximated. Furthermore, they are abstract in content, and both capital-, and time-consuming in census. This paper proposes to explore Wikipedia data as an alternative source of capturing the knowledge distribution on a narrow geographical scale. Wikipedia is by far the largest digital encyclopedia worldwide and provides data on usage and editing publicly. We com- pare Wikipedia usage worldwide and edits in the U. S. to existing measures of the acquisition and stock of knowledge. The results indicate that there is a significant correlation between Wikipedia interactions and knowledge approximations on different geographical scales. Considering these results, it seems promising to further explore Wikipedia data to develop a reliable, inexpensive, and real-time proxy of knowledge distribution around the world.",TRUE,FALSE,Knowledge Geographies|Mining of Big Social Data|Wikipedia,2019-10-09T14:42:45.707036,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:42:22.851449,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/citation/,c2gd8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9dc13bf6b03e000f1be742/,5d9dc13bf6b03e000f1be742,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2gd8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2gd8/,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67256-44,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c2gd8

At the core of this debate is the question whether behavioural economics is shaped by large-scale content imports from psychology, or whether these transfers have been too selective to challenge dominant approaches in economics. This study contributes to the debate in analysing a variety of bibliographic data from the disciplinary boundary between economics and psychology. Two datasets from the boundary of behavioural economics and psychology are compared to sets of economic and psychology publications in quantifying the use of mathematics, the share of empirical contributions, the authors’ academic background, and their cross-citations via network analysis. In contrast to proposals made by some methodologists and behavioural economists, the statistical results confirm content transfers from psychology via behavioural economics only to a limited extend. The observed level of interaction provides evidence for a selective import of specific psychological findings by a small number of established investigators in behavioural economics. These findings were then intensively debated as divergences from rationality within the growing, but econ-centered community of behavioural economists.",TRUE,FALSE,Behavioral economics|Bibliographic data mining|Citation analysis|Economic methodology|Social network analysis,2019-10-09T14:42:05.396408,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:41:45.828132,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/citation/,83jeg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9dc014a7bc73000be7f846/,5d9dc014a7bc73000be7f846,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83jeg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/83jeg/,https://doi.org/10.1080/1350178X.2018.1511257,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/83jeg

Our main questions concern the BRICs’ willingness to accept AEoI, and their agreement to the Western-dominated OECD as its institutional forum. First, we examine the domestic drivers for BRICs’ participation, as their statist model of capitalism reveals strong disincentives to join this regime and the fact that the budgetary consequences of the global financial crisis were less severe than in Western states. We argue that their agreement on AEoI results more from their persistent balance-of-payments vulnerability to illicit capital than from fiscal weakness, while also discussing the possibilities for mock compliance. Second, we review the role of the non-reciprocal US foreign account tax compliance act (FATCA) in shaping the BRICs’ preference for a multilateral AEoI-regime centred around the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS).

While the former signifies an essential step forward in reducing tax evasion, the BEPS outcomes were criticized for merely patching up flawed taxation principles based on the arms’-length standard. The emergence of global automatic exchange of information is often ascribed to the US who unilaterally enforced its own FATCA automatic information-exchange standard, while no comparable action happened during BEPS. This article investigates the US position on the BEPS outcomes and if a similar unilateral action would have led to more far-reaching cooperation concerning BEPS. By examining the distributional consequences of cooperation in both processes, we conclude that US power in tax governance in both issues is more limited than generally assumed and insufficient to explain global cooperation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-09T14:34:45.998527,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:34:16.844025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/citation/,ewd3j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c9b73fcf91f00121a3068/,5d9c9b73fcf91f00121a3068,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewd3j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewd3j/,https://doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2018.1496558,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewd3j

Both inward and outwards in the parallel OECD negotiations on digital taxation. By drawing on Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Framework, elite interviews and policy documents, I assess the dynamics of the proposal at the EU and OECD. While the DST will fall short in the EU Council due to unanimity requirements, I argue that the Commission actually achieved its pre-prescribed goals. Within the EU, it provided coherency for unilateral DSTs by member states. At the OECD, the proposals increased the threat of uncoordinated unilateral measures. This created a period of uncertainty and pressured laggard states, which helped lead to a tentative window for reform. As such, the proposals are an example of cross-platform policy entrepreneurship by the EU Commission, projecting influence despite unanimity constraints.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-09T14:40:22.021684,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:39:50.655020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/citation/,k2t9j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c9a56f6b03e000f1a20ad/,5d9c9a56f6b03e000f1a20ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k2t9j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k2t9j/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k2t9j

Comparing Frame Occurrence in Online and Traditional News Media Reporting on Europe’s  “Migration Crisis”,"News media have transformed over the last decades, with rising online news suppliers and an increase in online news consumption. We examine how reporting on immigration differs between popular German online and print media over three crucial years of the so-called immigration crisis, from 2015 to 2017. This study extends knowledge on framing of the crisis by examining a period covering start, peak, and the time after the intake of refugees. Moreover, we establish whether online and print reporting differs in terms of both frame occurrence and variability. The period of the crisis provided an ideal test to see whether the focus of media reporting differed between online and print sources. Employing a most similar cases design based on (autonomous) online and print versions of three major German news outlets, we extract the dominant frames in almost 18,500 articles using algorithm-based topic modelling. While results indicate that many frames are more visible in either online or print media, these differences often do not follow theoretical expectations. Furthermore, online media are dominated more by particular frames and, hence, show less diversity than print media. However, important key events happening during our period of investigation do not affect overall diversity of frames.",TRUE,FALSE,Framing|Germany|Immigration|Mass media|Migrant Crisis|Online|Print|Refugees,2019-10-09T14:36:42.247189,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09T14:36:12.935768,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/citation/,h3tpy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/etg5h/,etg5h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c5129fcf91f001219d096/,5d9c5129fcf91f001219d096,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3tpy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h3tpy/,https://doi.org/10.1515/commun-2019-0188,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h3tpy
