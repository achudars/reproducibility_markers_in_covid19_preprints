How Rejecting PAC Contributions Affects Contribution Patterns,"Do pledges to reject corporate PAC contributions minimize corporate influence in elections? I address this question with campaign finance data for Congressional candidates in the 2018 elections. While I find that candidates who pledge to reject corporate PAC contributions receive fewer contributions from business PACs, I also find that they substitute these funds with small-dollar contributions, large-dollar contributions from individuals affiliated with business interests, and large-dollar contributions from individuals outside their districts. These findings support the claim that voters are motivated to donate by anti-corporate PAC pledges, as candidates hope, but that these candidates likely substitute corporate PAC contributions with funds from sources beyond small-dollar donations. This study is the first to examine the effects of rejecting corporate PAC contributions on contribution patterns and the first test of the claim that anti-corporate PAC pledges will increase small-dollar donations.",TRUE,FALSE,Campaign Finance|Elections|Political Action Committees|Small Donors,2020-04-19T05:03:41.495753,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:45:19.081598,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/citation/,cf3jn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3m546/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/relationships/node/,3m546,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e988d0ad69735053bbdaa31/,5e988d0ad69735053bbdaa31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf3jn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cf3jn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cf3jn,NA

For example, in a recent academic text on the politics of the region, India merits only a few passing references and is described merely as a country that ‘interacts with the Asia-Pacific in various ways’.1 Although it would be a significant mistake to overlook or discount the role that India is playing in this region, such omissions are somewhat understandable. From a geographic standpoint, India does not border the Pacific Ocean and it is only through its far-flung Nicobar and Andaman island territories that it is even adjacent to the key maritime choke points linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans. For those who narrowly conceive of East Asia stretching in an arc from Myanmar to Japan on the basis of race or a mythical quasi- Confucian culture, India would not appear to ‘belong’. In terms of security linkages, India has traditionally had little involvement with either of the two key security issues in the region: the China–Taiwan dispute and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (North Korea) quest for nuclear weapons. Finally, from an economic standpoint, at present India’s economic linkages with the region do not approach the depth or breadth that the nations of East Asia and Australasia have among themselves. While all of these factors may appear to be good reasons for not considering India’s role in the region, to do so would be a mistake. A steadily expanding economy, paired with a growing partnership with key regional actors, is positioning India to have a dynamic impact on the emerging economic and security architecture of the Asia- Pacific.",TRUE,FALSE,Asia|Australia|India|Japan|Look East|New Zealand|South Korea|Taiwan,2020-04-19T05:03:52.266726,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:44:43.664160,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/citation/,jkges,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e988cd9d69735052cbdd86c/,5e988cd9d69735052cbdd86c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkges/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jkges/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jkges,https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203828861-13
65pgr,preprints,2020-04-16T16:42:30.062297,2020-04-19T05:03:46.658689,2020-04-18T14:44:03.201470,NA,NA,COVID-19: Insights from Innovation Economists (with French executive summary),"The present document provides the take of innovation economists on the current pandemic. It is addressed to the general public and focuses on questions related to the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) ecosystem. It does not present new research findings. Instead, it provides a reading of current real-world developments using economic reasoning and relying on existing economic research.

The first part of the report explains the root causes for a general underinvestment in Research and Development (R&amp;D), with a particular focus on vaccines. These causes include an insufficient demand for vaccines in normal times and the very characteristics of R&amp;D. Governments can intervene to mitigate these problems, but government intervention comes with its own set of issues. We discuss three of them, namely free riding, setting research priorities, and acting on scientific knowledge.

The second part discusses several aspects related to current STI policy reactions. First, we observe a sizable shift of funds towards research on SARS-CoV-2. Aren’t we wasting money by allocating so much of it on one single scientific problem? Using the concept of the ‘elasticity of science,’ we argue that we are far from a situation where additional funding would represent a waste of money.

Second, we also observe an unprecedented level of cooperation among researchers but also an intense competition to find therapeutic solutions and vaccines. We seek to make sense of this apparent antonymy, highlighting how both cooperative and competitive forces might accelerate research.

Third, we focus on one policy tool, namely patents, and we discuss whether the existence of patents hampers the search for a solution. We argue that it might, but we provide ways in which patents can be beneficial. They can accelerate research (such as through patent pools) or ensure greater access to innovations (such as with compulsory licensing).

Fourth, we notice that the whole STI ecosystem has been rapidly refocusing on SARS-CoV-2 in a way similar to mission-oriented R&amp;D (MOR) programs such as the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. We highlight the fundamental differences between MOR and the present situation. Today’s response is characterized by a proliferation of a wide range of innovative solutions offered by a complex set of institutions and actors with great intellectual freedom and decentralized competition.

The third part of the report assesses some potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We firstly discuss its impact on R&amp;D investment. We explain how innovation might be negatively affected by a prolonged economic downturn and highlight the crucial role of stimulus packages in confronting the recession. We also address the influence of the crisis on ICT, arguing that it has been a formidable catalyst for ICT adoption. Next, we focus on clean technologies, another major societal challenge besides the pandemic. There are strong reasons for why cleantech investment may suffer. However, the crisis also offers significant opportunities to accelerate the green transition. Finally, we focus on open science, in particular on open access and open data. The current crisis could be a catalyst for the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Practices.

The last part of the report offers some concluding thoughts. The STI policy response cannot be limited to the urgent need for ‘technological fixes.’ A second line of response involves the production of new knowledge to prevent outbreaks (ex-ante) or mitigate their effects (ex-post). Furthermore, the current crisis is a reminder that all branches of science matter. The pandemic has many facets, and a significant number of scientific disciplines can contribute to dealing with it. We conclude with a forward-looking note, arguing that the most substantial impact of the pandemic may lie outside of the public health realm or the science system. It offers a unique opportunity to adapt the set of rules that govern our society.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|economics|innovation|policy,2020-04-19T05:03:46.643724,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:44:03.201470,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/citation/,65pgr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e988af7d69735053bbda569/,5e988af7d69735053bbda569,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65pgr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/65pgr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/65pgr,NA

In an attempt to answer the objective, a quantitative research method utilizing a descriptive-correlational research design was employed. The study was conducted in Region XI which is located at the Southeastern  part  of  Mindanao, Philippines. The employees of print media companies in Region XI were the respondents particularly those in printing press business industry that offers printing, publications, and adverting services. There were 419 employees of printing industry participated in the study. The study was employed the questionnaires adapted from different studies and to fit the context of the respondents of this study. The instrument was divided into four parts such as Innovative Work Behavior, Work Engagement, Organization learning and Work Performance. Results revealed that there is a significant relationship between innovative work behavior, organizational learning, work engagement and work performance of print media employees. Among the three independent variables, only the organizational learning and work engagement significantly predict employees work performance while the innovative work behavior does significantly predict employees work performance.

Despite the fact that little is known about this mode of policing, a consensus seems to prevail regarding its ineffectiveness for crime deterrence and crime prevention. To emphasize this gap of research, this study systematically reviews existing literature on routine police patrol.
Methods: A systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines of scientific studies (n=4) was conducted. Evidence was synthesized quantitatively (e.g., tabular) and qualitatively (e.g., narrative argumentation). 
Results: The synthesized results provide no ground for the diagnosed ineffectiveness of routine police patrol, that seems to be believed throughout criminological studies. Despite the outdated character of the majority of reviewed studies, results show inconsistencies and fail to clearly establish positive or negative quantitative crime deterrent effects.
Conclusion: Contemporary research does not adequately understand the effects of routine police patrol and builds leading police research on a limited number of methodically flawed studies from the mid 1970’s. Future research should establish the effectiveness of this mode of policing and optimal spatial allocation of police officers following a sound methodological framework.",TRUE,FALSE,crime|deterrence|police|routine police patrol|systematic review,2020-04-19T05:03:59.346179,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:39:47.883965,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/citation/,gkdfp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9856034301660516a05287/,5e9856034301660516a05287,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gkdfp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gkdfp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gkdfp,NA

Whereas the former is well known, the latter is not. Arguably, contagion itself and the severity of its symptoms are likely to vary among elderly persons living alone, co-residing with family members or dwelling in institutions. Arguments in favour and against the premise that single-living elderly are better able to self-isolate can be made. Long-term care facilities have worsened the effects of the epidemic because they have often become death traps in some but not all countries. Once contagion takes place, living arrangements can make a huge difference in the way the disease can be managed by the individual, his family and society. Properly understanding the dynamics of contagion and the handling of the disease in terms of living arrangements of elderly people is essential for effectively tackling future outbreaks of similar epidemics.",TRUE,FALSE,contagion|co-residence|COVID-19|epidemics|lethality|living alone|population aging|rest homes,2020-04-19T05:03:59.672595,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:39:06.350025,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/citation/,bfvxt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e98433bf135350512d5669a/,5e98433bf135350512d5669a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfvxt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bfvxt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bfvxt,NA

A Study of the Italian Twittersphere from Before, During and After the Law on Mandatory Vaccinations","In July 2017, a law aimed at reversing the decline in vaccination coverage (Law 119/2017) made child vaccination mandatory in Italy. The law sparked a heated debate which was a breeding ground for disinformation and misinformation but also set the stage for some initiatives that have been trying to fight the problem.
This paper analyzes the Twitter vaccine-related information environment by focusing on the information sources shared by about 500,000 tweets published from 18 months before to 18 months after the promulgation of the Law 119/2017 (three years), it highlights clusters of sources shared by the users and changes in problematic and quality information over time.
Results show that the politicization of the topic was associated with a growing spread of misinformation, and that the vaccine-related information environment is characterized by an homophilic and polarized structure grouping together and opposing, on the one side, anti-vaccinations, blacklisted sources, alternative therapy and conspiracy websites, and on the other side, scientific and health sources. Moreover, despite the new initiatives aimed at increasing quality information online and fighting misinformation and “fake news”, there was a relative lack of scientific information both during and after the debate on the vaccinations law, while problematic information seems to have grown over the three years taken into consideration.",TRUE,FALSE,Anti-Vaccine Movement|Disinformation|Health Disinformation|Misinformation|Social Media|Twitter|Vaccine,2020-04-19T05:03:57.969700,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:40:21.599322,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/citation/,cnkm8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e981a4df135350511d52b40/,5e981a4df135350511d52b40,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnkm8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cnkm8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cnkm8,NA

We build on prior research by comparing the size and linearity of compositional effects in primary and secondary schools and testing whether students differ in sensitivity to school composition, while addressing critiques of potential biases from measurement error and selection effects. A set of residualised-change and cross-sectional models were tested for selection bias, linearity, differential sensitivity and substantiveness of the compositional effect. We found that the relationship between composition and achievement growth was larger in secondary than primary schools while addressing potential biases from measurement error and selection effects. The socio-economic compositional effect was non-linear in several academic domains, reducing as average school SES increased.  Secondary students differed in sensitivity to composition by family socio-economic status, with sensitivity reducing as family socio-economic status increased. We found that socioeconomic composition was a substantive effect, both as a comparative predictor of academic achievement and explaining school-level variance in achievement growth. We conclude that the school socio-economic compositional effect substantively influences systemic performance and equity. We argue school composition should be a leading focus of policy reform as reducing school segregation would improve systemic school performance and equity.",TRUE,FALSE,differential sensitivity|measurement error|non linear|residualized change|school composition|selection bias|socio-economic,2020-04-19T05:03:48.059412,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:37:40.886137,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",Michael G.

And we can get a hypothesis that Narmer (Yu the Great) may use the Egyptian boats to come to Zhejiang, China (中国浙江). Besides, in my point of view, the single-log coffin in the Royal Mausoleum of Yue Kingdom on the Seal Mount resembles Abydos boats in meaning and shape. By the way, from the remains of Narmer (Yu the Great) in China and Japan, it can further prove hyperdiffusionism from Egypt by Grafton Elliot Smith. Besides, a series of conclusions can be drawn from the comparative study of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph characters and ancient Chinese characters: the hieroglyph name of eighth nome of Upper Egypt is the Chinese character Ji(冀). The ancient Abydos city is the Yang (阳) city which was the capital of Chinese recorded several Emperors, Yao (Iry-Hor/Ro), Shun (Ka/Sekhen), Yu (Narmer). Furthermore, we can get a conclusion that Double Phoenixes Greeting the Sun in the archway in Yu mausoleum (大禹陵) resembles winged sun disk symbol in Egypt in meaning and shape. By the way, in my point of view, wupeng boat(乌篷船) resembles the unique and striking black boat of Tomb 100, the oldest tomb with painted decoration on its plaster walls at Nekhen. So in this paper and the previous paper the Location where Narmer probably buried, I can get a hypothesis that Yu(Narmer) chose Fanshan (反山) as his tomb at first , but died while on a hunting tour to the eastern frontier of his empire, so the fleet used the wood pile to fasten the Wupeng boat(乌篷船), and used the Wupeng boat(乌篷船) to carry the body of Narmer(Yu the Great), used Burying Stones(窆石) to bury him in Yu mausoleum (大禹陵) ,  Mount Kuaiji (会稽山) , south of present-day Shaoxing (绍兴).",TRUE,FALSE,Abydos boats|Burying Stones(窆石)|hyperdiffusionism|mortise-and-tenon|Narmer|Royal Mausoleum of Yue Kingdom on the Seal Mount|single-log coffin|Tomb 100|wood pile|wupeng boat(乌篷船)|Yu mausoleum (大禹陵)|Yu the Great,2020-04-19T05:04:00.745254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:36:58.112497,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce5|Arts and Humanities|History|Other History,Bohai Xu,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/citation/,2qybm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e97d307d6973504ecbe2d33/,5e97d307d6973504ecbe2d33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2qybm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2qybm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2qybm,NA
