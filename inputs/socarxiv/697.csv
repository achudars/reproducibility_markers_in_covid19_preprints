punishes willful infringers by subjecting them to treble damages. An odd
set of legal rules stemming from patent law's effort to determine what
constitutes willful infringement effectively requires companies confronted
with a patent first to obtain a written opinion of counsel and then to
disclose that opinion in court. To do that, the accused infringer will have
to waive its attorney-client privilege in virtually every case. Even worse,
the law puts the question whether an accused infringer will have to waive
privilege in the hands of the patent owner, who can send a carefully
crafted letter putting a potential defendant on notice of the patent. A
patent owner thus triggers the obligation to obtain a written opinion of
counsel without actually threatening to sue anyone. In turn, accused
infringers who are aware of these rules respond to such letters by
obtaining a sort of pseudo-legal advice that both they and their attorneys
recognize to be a construct. Both plaintiffs and defendants are playing a
costly game.

The rules of this game have perverse consequences for patent law. Some of
these consequences affect litigation - lawyers and clients who know that
the lawyer's advice will be disclosed to the other side will behave
differently, withholding information and candid advice from each other. But
other consequences extend beyond litigation. They infect pre-litigation
advice, essentially making it impossible for a competent lawyer to advise a
client that a competitor's patent should be avoided. The rules of the
willful infringement game set traps for the unwary, who may not realize the
consequences of failing to obtain the necessary written opinion of counsel.
They interfere with a client's ability to choose counsel. And they
discourage engineers and companies from reading a competitor's patents at
all, thereby undermining the disclosure function that is at the foundation
of the patent system.

One possibility is to abolish the willfulness rule entirely. We ultimately
reject this approach because we worry that ordinary patent damages alone
will be insufficient to deter infringement optimally in many cases. Another
possibility is to abolish the rule that requiring disclosure of opinions of
counsel. While a good idea, this option would not solve the problems
created by the willfulness game, because many defendants will still need to
rely on the opinion of counsel in order to disprove willfulness.

Instead, we think the better approach to willful infringement is first to
redefine it as adopting a technology with knowledge that it was derived
from the patentee, and second to adjust the premium charged for it. Many of
the problems with the willfulness rules stem from the fact that willfulness
is an ongoing inquiry. The ongoing nature of the inquiry adversely affects
a defendant that develops or adopts a technology in good faith but later
learns it is infringing a patent. Changing the focus of the inquiry to the
time of adoption is consistent with the ordinary understanding of
willfulness outside of patent law and would help end the willfulness game.
An independent developer could never be a willful infringer, and thus would
not need either to obtain or disclose in court a written opinion of counsel
merely because it later learned of a patent. By contrast, an accused
infringer would need advice of counsel if it was aware of a patent and
affirmatively sought to design around the patent. Such an accused infringer
therefore would have to waive privilege. But since only the accused
infringer's intent at the time of adoption would matter, the scope of
privilege waiver would be limited to communications at the time of
adoption, and would not infect the advice given by litigation counsel.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:08.311391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T19:15:17.337000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/citation/,sgkf7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wj7cu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/relationships/node/,wj7cu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c09546594d900206358a61/,57c09546594d900206358a61,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sgkf7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sgkf7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sgkf7

Property Rights and Collective Rights Organizations,” Rob Merges makes the
case that intellectual property (IP) owners vested with property
entitlements can and do contract away their right to an injunction when it
is efficient for them to do so. The result was to cement for many the
superiority of property over liability rules, since Merges demonstrated a
seemingly critical asymmetry between the two. Merges’s evidence suggested
that if a judge or a legislature gets the damages calculation wrong, we are
stuck with an inefficient liability rule, but that we weren’t similarly
stuck with an inefficiently-allocated property rule.

The evidence Merges brought to bear in his path-breaking article is
extremely important. But it is incomplete. True, parties can contract
around inefficient property rules in IP cases. But as I show in this paper,
they can - and do - contract around inefficient liability rules as well.
The result does not prove the superiority of liability rules over property
rules, but it does undermine a major premise that has been used to support
the claim that IP rights must be protected by property rules.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:35.599220,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T19:15:00.481000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/citation/,a9qmc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/89ufe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/relationships/node/,89ufe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c095369ad5a102074c8c93/,57c095369ad5a102074c8c93,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9qmc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a9qmc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a9qmc

as a mental act and a competing vision that focuses on the actual building
of a working product. The definition of invention in the 1952 Patent Act
incorporates both conception and reduction to practice, sometimes choosing
the first to conceive as the inventor and at other times choosing the first
to reduce an invention to practice. But in trying to walk that middle
ground, patent law has actually discouraged inventors from getting their
inventions to work in practice, rewarding those who run to the patent
office before they are fully done with the invention and giving them
precedence over those who take the time to make sure their invention works
by building and testing it. The problem is even worse under the new America
Invents Act passed in 2011, which encourages patentees to file their
applications as soon as possible.

The fact that the law encourages inventors to file first and figure out
later how (or even if) the invention works for its intended purpose is
unfortunate. It produces underdeveloped patent applications that do not
communicate useful information to the world. It facilitates the rise of
patent trolls who obtain patents but never bother to produce a product,
instead making a business of suing those who do. And it pushes people to
patent things just in case, adding more patents into a system already
overburdened with them.

I reject proposals to go to the opposite extreme, requiring patentees to
make products. But we should not be in the position in which we currently
find ourselves: treating inventors less favorably if they try to build and

product-producing companies can sometimes provide such innovation, either
directly, through working the patent or transfer of technology to others
who do, or indirectly, when others copy the patented innovation. The
available evidence suggests, however, that patent licensing demands and
lawsuits from NPEs are normally not cases that involve any of these
activities.

Some scholars have argued that patents can be valuable even without
technology transfer because the ability to exclude others from the market

law serves its proper purpose of encouraging market exchange and lowering
consumer search costs. As we have explained in detail elsewhere, the
doctrine ensures that trademarks do not become a weapon used to suppress
speech or to interfere with rather than promote the efficient operation of
the marketplace.

Those goals are even more important in the context of trademark dilution.
Unlike a normal cause of action for trademark infringement, trademark
dilution gives broader rights to a few famous mark owners to prevent even
non-confusing uses in order to protect the uniqueness of their marks
against blurring and tarnishment. But because trademark dilution can exist
even when goods do not compete, and even absent any likelihood of
confusion, it is even more critical that the universe of actions that can
give rise to dilution be cabined by a clear and effective trademark use
doctrine.

The Lanham Act has had a trademark use limitation on dilution since the
first dilution legislation was enacted in 1996, but recent amendments have
changed the language and scope of that limitation, leading to some
confusion about what is and is not protected. In this article, we parse the

categorical rules or broad, open-ended standards that allow for
case-specific adjudication. Antitrust law is generally thought of as
inhabiting the standards end of this spectrum. In fact, however, despite
the generality of the enabling statutes antitrust law is rife with
categorical distinctions.

In Part I, we explore not only the well-known distinction between conduct
that is per se illegal and conduct judged under the rule of reason, but
also a number of categorical distinctions the courts draw, either to help
delineate the scope of the per se rule or to create distinctions within the
scope of the rule of reason itself. By and large these rules don't come
from the antitrust statutes. They are created by courts, who are in effect
converting case-specific standards en masse into categorical rules.

In Part II, we identify a number of problems with these distinctions. One
problem is administrative: courts spend a great deal of time trying to
parse conduct in order to put it on one side or another of the lines they
have created. Indeed, in many cases courts spend more time on
categorization than they do on actual economic analysis of the case itself.
Second, judicial antitrust categories are subject to manipulation. Parties
go to great lengths to fit into a box that will give them more favorable
treatment, sometimes by legal argument, sometimes by restructuring a
transaction, and sometimes by concealing or misrepresenting the facts of
that transaction. Third, a number of the categories the courts have created
make no sense, whether because they have lost their meaning over time,
because their boundaries have eroded, because they actually tell us very
little of relevance to the competitive effects of the transaction, or
because they are simply dumb. The net result is a mess. Categories have
become conclusions, displacing the fact-specific economic analysis in which
antitrust law is supposed to be engaging.

In Part III, we argue that there is a better way. We evaluate the costs and
benefits of the judicial creation of categories, and contend that the
complex of antitrust boxes the courts have created today does more harm
than good. We don't mean to suggest there is no value to categories, and
that everything must be thrown into a pure cost-benefit analysis. Some
rules (the per se rule against price fixing, for instance) make sense.
Rather, the important thing is to make sure that the categories we use have
empirical support, and that they are communicating valuable information to
courts about the competitive effects of a general practice. We think the
courts have gone too far in the creation of rules in a variety of cases.
Finally, we suggest that courts make more use than they do of certain tools

this reason, the fundamental requirement for getting a patent is that you
have invented something new.

It is curious, then, that patent law itself purports to pay no attention to
which aspects of a patentee’s invention are in fact new. A patented
invention is legally defined by its claims – written definitions of the
invention. And those written definitions virtually never call out what it
is that is new about the patentee’s invention.

Even if the parties do identify the novel element of an invention, the law
purports not to care. Long-standing patent law doctrine has decried any
focus on the “point of novelty” of an invention. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit evaluates the claim as a whole, not just
the piece of the claim that the patentee actually added to the storehouse
of knowledge. As the court frequently puts it, “there is no legally
recognizable . . . ‘gist’ or ‘heart’ of the invention.”

It turns out, however, to be hard to sustain a rule that a law concerned
with novelty will pay no attention to the point of novelty. And so
point-of-novelty issues crop up in a number of different doctrines in
patent law, from figuring out who counts as an inventor to whether the
inventor has disclosed the “best mode” of practicing the invention to when
the sale of a product exhausts the patentee’s rights in the patent. Courts
are inconsistent in whether and how they consider the point of novelty in
these doctrines and more. But when the Federal Circuit presented with a
question in point-of-novelty terms, it most often falls back on the mantra
that there is no point of novelty to an invention, even if it means
discarding long-standing precedent.

It’s time to rethink the no-point-of-novelty doctrine in patent law. I
argue that ignoring what is novel about patentee’s invention makes little
sense as an across-the-board matter, and leads to a variety of harmful
consequences. While refusing to focus on the point of novelty serves some
valuable purposes, there are other ways to achieve those ends. And in the
end, a patent regime that pays attention to what the patentee actually
invented, not what the patent lawyer wrote down, is more likely to achieve
the goal of promoting innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:42.042746,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T18:46:07.401000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/citation/,mbf6w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y7dk7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/relationships/node/,y7dk7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c08e70594d90020b358a61/,57c08e70594d90020b358a61,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbf6w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbf6w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mbf6w
