This paper uses qualitative interviews to understand the process by which graduates of elite colleges decide where to live following graduation. It shows that many graduates are indifferent about exactly where they live, and find themselves funneled towards certain cities based on geographically uneven access to two key types of information. Facilitative information eases the job search process, enabling graduates to find and obtain opportunities they want, while formative information helps them determine what they want in the first place.  Graduates’ position in social structure—in particular their past experiences and personal networks—affects their exposure to both types of information in ways that strongly influence where they end up and on occasion even overcome their stated location preferences. This geographically uneven access to information supplies one mechanism leading to the spatial concentration of human capital.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-16T19:16:29.682034,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16T19:15:50.683980,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/citation/,f6rnk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8d28ce075b640019a3d3c1/,5c8d28ce075b640019a3d3c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6rnk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6rnk,NA

The present paper builds from this growing literature in its analysis of the formation of National Public Radio (NPR), to better understand how organizational actors translate racialized practices into new organizations at their foundation, even when they seek greater racial inclusivity. I coin a new analytical concept, white institutional isomorphism, to analyze how organizations that embrace a mission of diversity may end up reproducing racially exclusionary practices. White institutional isomorphic pressures are racialized norms that shape the standards and practices adopted across organizations within a given field. Using organizational meeting minutes, external reports, oral histories, and founder memoirs, I show that early implementation of station membership criteria, hiring practices, and programming priorities, while considered race-neutral decisions by the founders that shared a white habitus, inhibited the inclusion of nonwhite voices into NPR’s workforce, station membership, and programming.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity|organizations|race|radio|whiteness,2019-03-16T15:41:45.108558,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16T15:41:24.320705,FALSE,NA,no,"National Public Broadcasting Archives, College Park, Maryland",,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Laura Garbes,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/citation/,tj5cs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8d0c65075b640019a3be05/,5c8d0c65075b640019a3be05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tj5cs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tj5cs,NA

Amidst the chaos, analysts were expected to provide stakeholders with impact estimates immediately following the hurricane. Unfortunately, this strong need for fast information after the disaster coincided with limited options for high-quality data sources to help stakeholders address challenges such as resource allocation and bond-pricing. Given the stabilization of data sources since the hurricanes, this paper examines historical demographic and economic data to give a long-term view of population change in Puerto Rico. First, we juxtapose population, employment, hurricanes and significant economic events to make the argument that the clearest driver of population decline in Puerto Rico is simply the economic health of the island (i.e. employment). Second, we focus on Pre- and Post-Hurricane Irma/Maria migration estimates to highlight the spike in outmigration following the hurricanes, as well as the, return immigration in the first half of the first half of 2018. Finally, we study historical net outmigration and employment trends to illustrate the short-lived outmigration impacts of hurricanes while also highlighting the long-term outmigration impacts of economic downturns. In short, we argue that the primary reason people are leaving Puerto Rico is the struggling economy and not hurricane-related destruction. The hurricanes simply exacerbated the economic-related outmigration trends and we believe that any serious plans for Puerto Rico’s restoration must include special attention to stimulate the economy.",TRUE,FALSE,Economy|Employment|Hurricane Maria|Population|Puerto Rico,2019-03-15T21:51:06.931490,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T21:36:03.327899,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/citation/,3frzu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8c03f1075b640019a2deb8/,5c8c03f1075b640019a2deb8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3frzu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3frzu,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11111-020-00355-5

Testing a Salience Model on German Service Sector Employees,"The present study tested an extended version of Voydanoff's (2004) 'differential salience vs. comparable salience' model in a sample of German service workers. Our findings partially support the model in a different national/cultural context but also yielded some divergent findings with respect to within-domain resources and boundary-spanning demands. In line with the theoretical framework, work-to-home interference (WHI) mainly occurred because of high work demands and not because of a lack of work resources. Boundary-spanning resources yielded comparable potential to reduce WHI and enhance work-to-home enrichment (WHE). WHE was expected to more likely occur due to the activation of work resources rather than the absence of work demands. However, control over one's work did not have a significant impact on WHE. In addition and contrary to the theoretical model, boundary-spanning demands were found to be differentially rather than comparably salient to the work–family interface.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-15T21:47:21.461992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T21:34:46.260928,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",The authors,2011,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/citation/,2jva4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8bfd9180f5d2001783073b/,5c8bfd9180f5d2001783073b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jva4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2jva4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2jva4,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2010.07.008

This finding, however, can depict people of color or poor people as more prejudiced than White, middle-class families. In this 18-month ethnographic study, the author complicates this rejection paradigm through documenting the narratives of 40 LGBTQ youth experienc- ing homelessness. The author examines how poverty and family instability shaped the con- ditions that the youth perceived as their being rejected because of their gender and sexuality.

In particular, I define lineal kinship organization as a social system that emphasizes interactions among lineally related kin — that is, individuals related through females only, if the emphasis is towards matrilineal kin, and individuals related through males only, if the emphasis is towards patrilineal kin. In a given population, the emphasis may be expressed in one or more social domains, corresponding to pathways for the transmission of different resources across generations (e.g. the allocation of food, the transfer of access to the natal territory or household).
A lineal bias in any domain can be viewed as a bias in investment towards a particular set of kin — specifically, towards the offspring of daughters if the bias is matrilineal, and towards the offspring of sons if the bias is patrilineal. Effectively, investment is restricted to the offspring of the females in the population in one case, and to the offspring of the males in the other. This is distinct from a bias in investment towards daughters and towards sons, respectively.
Overall, I propose a shift in focus — from viewing matrilineal and patrilineal kinship as unitary phenomena, to consideration of the different aspects of the social system featuring a bias towards lineally related kin.",TRUE,FALSE,descent|kinship systems|lineal kinship organization|matrilineal|patrilineal|post-marital residence,2019-03-15T18:28:41.535204,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T18:20:56.130140,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/citation/,2sznm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8bd6b3075b640019a2ae7b/,5c8bd6b3075b640019a2ae7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sznm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2sznm,NA

Results are compared to a control condition in which social identity is not induced. Results show that when the outgroup is better off than the ingroup, the average subject is spiteful: they derive negative utility from the outcomes of the outgroup other.

Identity, desistance and the experience of imprisonment","Desistance research has pushed criminologists to develop a nuanced conceptual account of criminal identity and human agency. However, these tools have mostly not been used to consider identity changes among long-sentenced prisoners, despite the growing preponderance of long-term imprisonment in England and Wales. As a result of this, desistance theory has not been used to evaluate the administration of indeterminate sentences, meaning that practitioners may be missing out on some of the insights that it can generate. This qualitative study begins to fill that gap, using a phenomenological analysis of eighteen in-depth semi-structured interviews with life- sentenced prisoners at a single prison in England, all of whom had been convicted of murder. It argues that most eventually attempt conscious projects of personal change during imprisonment; second, that many frame change in terms which are not consistent with the official discourses of risk reduction (which govern their progression through the sentence); and third, that how they themselves conceive and pursue personal change is affected by their position in the sentence and the life course, and also by the specific nature and circumstances of their index offences. The analysis classifies four different styles of agency found in the sample: ‘defensive’ and ‘fractured’ agents were unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for the offence, and were consequently in penal ‘dead ends’; while ‘corrective’ and ‘redemptive’ agents had encountered ‘turning points’, in that they accepted responsibility, albeit in different ways. The analysis describes each group’s characteristic ways of describing the offence and their part in it. It also describes their attitudes to prison social life in general, and to rehabilitative intervention in particular. The study as a whole suggests that much of the personal change which lifers themselves frame as significant happens outside rehabilitative interventions, and may be invisible to key prison staff. This raises important questions about whether prisons and prisoners think about rehabilitation in the same way, with consequences for the legitimacy of penal power.",TRUE,FALSE,criminology|desistance|england and wales|human agency|indeterminate imprisonment|life sentences|long-term imprisonment|prisons|risk-needs-responsivity|risk reduction,2019-03-15T15:45:22.888700,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T15:30:16.481471,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/citation/,3phn7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8b7e1280f5d2001681ddc2/,5c8b7e1280f5d2001681ddc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3phn7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3phn7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3phn7,NA
