This is particularly attractive for developing countries in which large parts of the population do not have access to quality basic services. Public sector managers looking to adopt innovation practices have established enabling structures and processes for their municipality or department, and have sought to empower civil servants with an innovation ‘culture’ or ‘mindset’. However, the growing pressure for public officials to adopt innovation thinking and engage with external innovators can create tensions with existing processes and ‘bureaucratic’ practices. Through a case study of South Africa’s state-owned enterprises, municipalities, sector departments and public innovation intermediaries, this chapter argues that a more nuanced view is needed of the diverse actors, roles and activities that do (and could) support public sector innovation. Each of these entities contributes specific legitimacies and capacities to innovation processes, based on underlying values, which can be better recognised and supported to achieve positive innovation outcomes and more inclusive service delivery.",TRUE,FALSE,development|government|innovation|South Africa,2021-03-18T15:26:05.604989,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T15:25:51.519936,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/citation/,e2xaz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60536994e8afef00835f3332/,60536994e8afef00835f3332,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2xaz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2xaz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2xaz,NA

Gender Inequality in the Employment Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany,"This paper evaluates gender inequality in employment risks during the first and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. We use individual-level panel data collected weekly between 20 March and 9 July 2020, and again in January 2021, to examine the risks of short-time work, job loss and unpaid furlough, as well as having to work on-site by means of growth curve modelling. The results reveal gender inequality in employment risks and gendered use of governmental support schemes. During the early phase of the pandemic, women had a higher probability of being temporarily exempted from work, but a lower probability of being in short-time work and receiving the associated state benefits. Compared to men, women also continuously had a higher probability of working on-site rather that from home. Consequently, women’s employment during the pandemic is more polarized between job loss or working on-site with the associated infection risk. Gender inequalities are rooted in the long-term gendered dualization of the German labour market with the low-wage sector and marginal employment being female dominated. The results call for close monitoring of long-term gendered effects of the pandemic recession and an adjustment of governmental crisis measures to the requirements of the female workforce.",TRUE,FALSE,Corona crisis|Furlough|Growth Curve Modelling|; Lockdown|Short-time work|Unemployment,2021-03-18T14:52:01.307994,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T14:51:30.784328,FALSE,NA,no,data is available after signing a data sharing agreement,,no,no preregistration,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/citation/,tzma5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605365c0c402cc0081977d30/,605365c0c402cc0081977d30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tzma5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tzma5,NA

EU Solidarity and Risk-Sharing in the COVID-19 Crisis,"Fiscal integration has long been regarded as a necessary condition to ensure the long-term stability of the euro. In the aftermath of the euro crisis, concerns about a populist backlash of Eurosceptic voters constrained national governments in their ability to pursue such integration. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, national leaders were able to agree to the Next Generation EU, a pandemic recovery fund of over 750 billion euro establishing an unprecedented, far-reaching, albeit temporary, fiscal stabilization capacity. Still, we know very little about citizens’ preferences towards the pandemic recovery fund? To answer this question, we conducted an original survey experiment on public support for different designs of a European pandemic recovery fund. We fielded the survey in five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain) in July 2020, at the time that national leaders agreed on the recovery fund. Our results show that there is surprisingly high support for a joint European fiscal instrument and that citizens react to different elements of the pandemic recovery fund. They prefer a broad program that is directed at countries in need, but they are skeptical about common debt. Yet, citizens’ skepticism towards common debt is not important enough for them to negatively evaluate the program as a whole. Overall, the pandemic recovery fund agreed under ‘Next Generation EU’ is a well-tailored instrument to generate widespread political support across European member states.",TRUE,FALSE,conjoint experiment|European Union|fiscal integration|pandemic recovery fund|public opinion|risk-sharing|solidarity,2021-03-18T14:34:28.304987,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T14:34:07.871538,FALSE,NA,no,The study relies on a novel survey that was conducted by the authors.

specificities in the student's admission process of a Brazilian federal university, which works as a natural
experiment. Individuals who are comparable in terms of previous academic achievement end up having
classmates with better or worse performance in college because of the assignment rule of students to
classrooms. Thus, our identification strategy for estimating peer effects on academic outcomes eliminates the
endogenous self-selection into groups that would otherwise undermine the causal inference of peer effects.
Overall, our findings showed that joining a class with high-ability students damages academic achievements
of the lowest-ability students at UFMG. Although male and female students are both negatively affected by
being in the first (better) class, we found gender differences. Specifically, being at the bottom of the better
class make females take less radical decisions compared to male students in the sense that female students
continue to study even though with lower performance (reduced GPA and credits earned) while male students
seem to be more prone towards dropping out (increased number of subjects – or even University registration
– cancelled and reduced attendance in classroom). We have also found other heterogeneities in peer effects
in college in terms of class shift, period of admission, area of study and parents’ education. This study is a
necessary step before investigating the impact of peer quality on after-graduating decisions using the same
natural experiment. This will allow us to deepen our understanding of how peer effects can also have long-lasting impacts.",TRUE,FALSE,College|Heterogeneities|Peer effects|Regression Discontinuity Design,2021-03-18T15:54:01.422678,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T15:53:39.441959,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/citation/,7n6ks,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60535a2ae8afef007b5f4385/,60535a2ae8afef007b5f4385,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n6ks/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7n6ks/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7n6ks,NA

Implementing these practices in traditional government departments is a challenge. Whilst relatively independent and flexible innovation agencies, hubs and programmes have been established to play a mediating role between the private sector and government, there continues to be significant friction between expected innovation-enabling practices and established bureaucratic procedures. A common response is that the public sector needs to be de-bureaucratised to support innovation. Through a case study of South Africa, this chapter aims to provide a more nuanced picture of where specific public sector capacities and legitimacies can be enhanced. This is done by highlighting (1) the significant diversity of public organisations and officials influencing industrial and social innovation; (2) the reasons why certain procedures and practices are in place; and (3) potential adjustments through which innovation support can be improved, including how it can better serve inclusive development goals. This analysis is an initial attempt to profile the distinctive characteristics of public sector innovation enablers, and provides a framework for identifying routines through which innovation and inclusive development outcomes may be achieved.",TRUE,FALSE,development|government|Innovation|policy|South Africa,2021-03-18T14:16:42.505327,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T14:16:23.117976,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/citation/,qcdjg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605353d690bb4e0078157ff7/,605353d690bb4e0078157ff7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcdjg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qcdjg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qcdjg,NA

After unpacking some of the key thinking around openness proffered by Karl Popper and others, we explore the adoption of open government practices in innovation by considering four important instruments: the opening of innovation and technology policy processes, co-creation and collaborative solution development by civil servants, government entities acting as innovation brokers, and public sector procurement of innovation. Through a case study of South Africa, we highlight how innovation actors prioritise particular values of openness over others. For example, in pushing for more open interaction between state and non-state actors as a more effective way of addressing social challenges, values of legality and impartiality are often minimised. This oversight leads to project failures, legitimacy crises and exploitation of relationships by powerful entities. In response, we suggest that public sector innovation programmes and platforms can more explicitly recognise different values, especially from emergent grassroots innovation networks, and thereby enable sustainable application of open government practices.",TRUE,FALSE,co-creation|inclusive development|Innovation|open government|procurement|South Africa,2021-03-18T13:01:24.979917,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T13:00:59.716581,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Cataloging and Metadata|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/citation/,4y6n9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60534c6290bb4e0086151579/,60534c6290bb4e0086151579,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y6n9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4y6n9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4y6n9,NA

These two areas of practice and research have converged around similar mechanisms aimed at achieving inclusive development outcomes including; open interaction between government, technologists and end-users in the design of policies and services; open, market-oriented approaches to delivering public services and meeting the needs of citizens; and a central role for information and communication technologies (ICTs) in policy development and innovation activities. We argue, however, that an uncritical adoption of open, ICT-oriented practices risks shifting responsibility and trust for governance and development outcomes to largely unaccountable global and national network enterprises. Taking South Africa as our primary focus, including its new White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), we note a renewed interest in adopting open government practices in relation to IID. More significant, we suggest, is the emergence of ‘grassroots’, hybrid civic-technology innovation networks at the fringes of formal open government initiatives. This article considers new questions that arise around how these grassroots movements sustain meaningful interaction with mainstream STI processes, how public officials may engage with such movements in order to meet national development outcomes, and the role of ICT in these spaces.",TRUE,FALSE,ICT|inclusive development|innovation|open data|open government|South Africa,2021-03-18T12:50:11.811194,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T12:49:51.695601,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Cataloging and Metadata|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/citation/,hmt8v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6053486ce8afef00775f0328/,6053486ce8afef00775f0328,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmt8v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hmt8v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hmt8v,https://doi.org/10.1080/20421338.2020.1746046

This article provides an overview of three methods to identify causal effects that are rarely used in sociology: instrumental variable (IV) regression, difference-in-differences (DiD), and regression discontinuity design (RDD). I provide intuitive introductions to these methods, discuss identifying assumptions, limitations of the methods, promising extension, and present an exemplary study for each estimation method that can serve as a benchmark when applying these estimation techniques.

Evidence from the European Union,"Governments redistribute ever larger shares of their budgets to enhance the economic performance of specific areas within their jurisdiction. However, there is little evidence about one of the most fundamental questions arising from such place-based policies: Do citizens reward politicians for funding that benefits their local environment?  To answer this question, I turn to the European Union and leverage quasi-experimental data from an initiative that distributed vouchers to European municipalities to establish free and high-quality WiFI connectivity before the European Parliament election in 2019. Moreover, I analyze geolocated data about beneficiaries of two major European Union funds, European Parliament election results along with register data from polling stations, and a city-wide survey experiment in Denmark. The results show that European place-based policy has little to no impact on turnout and Eurosceptic voting in European Parliament elections. The findings are discussed in the light of the recently introduced European Union recovery fund to combat economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,European Union|Place-Based Policy|Regression Discontinuity Design|Spatial Data Analysis|Survey Experiment,2021-03-18T11:12:43.047803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T11:12:15.994427,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Roman Senninger,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/citation/,tqjer,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605302ffc402cc005697a84b/,605302ffc402cc005697a84b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqjer/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqjer/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqjer,NA
