However, only a scarcity of research has examined the consumption process when the fundamental intention is to leverage group belonging. The literature comprises a single theoretical framework that describes this behaviour, a nascent proposition that has not been tested. This study reviews the transferability of the model and its descriptive extent of the phenomenon in a different context than the one originally used for its proposal. A qualitative deductive case study and a pattern matching analysis technique were employed. The findings revealed that the model is transferable, thus revealing its suitability for future research on consumer behaviour intentionally aimed to promote belonging.

A sample of 3,289 Italian high school students was used to validate the two constructs and compare their suitability and sensitivity for research on academic performance. First, the dimensionality, validity, and invariance of the two constructs were evaluated, and second, their relationships with students’ standardized test scores were modeled, accounting for potential confounders at individual and family levels.

Voters' preferences are captured by payoffs assigned to combinations of outcomes for each issue and they can be nonseparable: a voter's preference over an issue might be dependent on the other issue. When the collective decision in this context is reached by voting on both issues at the same time, multiple election paradoxes may arise, as studied extensively in the theoretical literature. In this paper we pursue an experimental approach and investigate the impact of iterative voting, in which groups deliberate by repeating the voting process until a final outcome is reached. Our results from experiments run in the lab show that voters tend to have an optimistic rather than a pessimistic behaviour when casting a vote on a non-separable issue and that iterated voting may in fact improve the social outcome.

As such, an abundant literature has focused on who gets temporal autonomy, without exploring exactly what that autonomy entails. This has important implications on our understanding of how temporal autonomy relates to social inequalities. This paper thus intends to shed light on the multiple dimensions of temporal autonomy and to determine whether they are linearly and hierarchically distributed among the French wage-earner population. Using data on 8086 respondents from the 2010 French Time-Use survey, three dimensions of temporal autonomy are identified: control over work time; control over time off; and autonomy in work organization. While control over work time can be read as a social gradient, control over time off is found to be industry-specific and less available to workers in education, health, personal services and manufacturing, and autonomy in work organization is more dependent on size of establishment and is gradually more prevalent as size decreases.

In this article, we analyze the privatization of companies as a potential but so far neglected factor behind the postsocialist fertility decline. We argue that privatization is linked to lower fertility by catalyzing uncertainty, shifting the cost of care work onto families, and reducing the resources available to support social reproduction. We test this hypothesis using a novel database comprising information on the demographic and enterprise trajectories of 52 Hungarian towns between 1989-2006 and a cross-country dataset of 28 countries in Eastern Europe. We fit fixed and random-effects models adjusting for potential confounding factors and control for time-variant factors and common trends. We find that company privatization is significantly associated with the postsocialist fertility decline. The observed level of privatization among Hungarian towns corresponds to 0.37 fewer childbirths per woman on average, i.e., approximately 54.3% of the overall fertility decline. Cross-country fixed effects models covering 28 former socialist-bloc countries for the 1989-2012 period confirm the town-level findings.

In order to develop a healthy adaptation process between the migrant community and the host society, it is especially necessary to conduct studies on the acculturation processes of young migrants. Exploring the acculturation orientation of migrant students in Turkey, one of the leading countries experiencing the migration movements intensively, this study collected data from a total of 110 migrant students, 69 females and 41 males. “Vancouver Index of Acculturation”, “Revised Social Contact Scale”, “Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support”, “Turkish Proficiency Level Questionnaire” and “Personal Information Form” were employed as data collection tools. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The analyses results revealed that the level of perceived social support of migrant students from their families and the quality of social contact significantly predicted their heritage culture orientation and explained 18% of them. In addition, the quantity of migrant students’ social contact and the quality of social contact significantly predicted their mainstream culture orientation and explained 25% of them. As a result, the present study put forth that in order to support the heritage culture orientation of migrant students, the perceived social support from the family should be improved, and the quantity and quality of social contact should be increased to reinforce their mainstream culture orientation and to facilitate the acculturation processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Acculturation Orientation|Migrant Students|Social Contact|Social Support,2020-12-13T15:39:41.687987,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-13T15:39:13.224437,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/citation/,5dxph,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd5c2caf0df5402592f06c6/,5fd5c2caf0df5402592f06c6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dxph/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5dxph/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5dxph,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.03.04.163
