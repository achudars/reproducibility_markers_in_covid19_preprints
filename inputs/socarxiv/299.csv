Flooding and Fertility Choices in Bangladesh,"A growing demographic literature has examined the impacts of climatic variability on human populations. Most of this work has focused on migration, morbidity, and mortality. Much less attention has been given to the effects of climate change on fertility, which represents an important gap given many plausible reasons to expect such effects. We address this issue by examining the relationship between exposure to flooding and fertility in Bangladesh. We link birth records (n=355,532 person-years) from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) with satellite-derived measures of flooding from 2002 through 2014 and estimate statistical models of the relationship between flood exposure and subsequent fertility outcomes. We also conduct secondary analyses of the relationship between flood exposure and four expected causal pathways: women’s marriage, contraceptive use, employment, and health. Results suggest that flood exposure reduces the probability of childbearing, and that this effect operates with a two-year lag. Negative effects are concentrated among women with a primary school education or higher and low-parity women. In contrast, women at high parities (e.g., at or above four) tend to increase their fertility in response to flooding. We find little evidence that observed flooding effects operate through the causal pathways we test, raising questions for future research about the mechanisms that explain our findings.",TRUE,FALSE,Bangladesh|climate change|fertility|flooding,2020-04-12T03:35:41.544768,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:35:25.600552,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Brian Thiede|Joyce Chen|Valerie Mueller|Yuanyuan Jia|Carolynne Hultquist,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/citation/,cz482,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8fbe10d697350271bdba63/,5e8fbe10d697350271bdba63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cz482/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cz482,NA

on 4 April, 2020 to track and visualize these massive and
extraordinary expansions of police power and the unequal
patterns of enforcement they are likely to produce. In doing
so, we hope that we can bring to light patterns of police
intervention, to help understand who is being targeted, what
justifications are being used by police, and how marginalized
people are being impacted. More broadly, we hope the
project will inform a larger conversation about the role of
policing in society, to scrutinize public health and police
collaboration, and to focus attention toward the harms of
criminalization. Having an understanding of these patterns in
coming weeks will help inform approaches to actively resist
the logic and practices of policing crisis and disease, rather
than allow them to become widespread and normalized.
Through the acts of identifying, reporting, and visualizing
events related to the policing of COVID-19, the project
offers a living repository of publicly accessible data that can
be used by activists, academics, journalists, and community
members to analyze, discuss, and challenge the policing of

The prevalence, intensity  and determinants of multiple jobholding in Canada","While traditional labour market estimates indicate little change in the proportion of workers holding multiple jobs in North America, survey instrument deficiencies may be hiding more substantial growth driven by the gig economy. To address this possibility, I test a broader measure of multiple jobholding to examine its prevalence in the Canadian workforce based on two national studies of workers (2011 CAN-WSH and 2019 C-QWEL studies). Almost twenty percent of workers in 2019 report multiple jobholding—a rate that is three times higher than Statistics Canada estimates. While multivariate analyses reveal that the multiple jobholding rate in 2019 was thirty percent higher than in the 2011 CAN-WSH study, multiple jobholders in 2019 were less likely to report longer work hours in secondary employment. Analyses also reveal that having financial difficulties is consistently associated with multiple jobholding in 2011 and 2019. Collectively, these findings suggest that while the spread of short-term work arrangements has facilitated Canadians’ secondary employment decisions, for many workers these decisions may reflect underlying problems in the quality of primary employment in Canada, rather than labour market opportunity.

Communities are frequently described as dependent upon natural resource development, but limited attention has been paid to what that means. In the literature, resource dependence is often treated as over-specialization in, or over-reliance upon, the natural resource sectors. However, the logic of over-specialization conceptually grounds dependence in poor economic outcomes. Thus, a one-dimensional typology of dependence based upon a threshold of the share of development in the natural resource sector---as has commonly been used in prior scholarship---does not fully capture the concept and risks tautology. In this paper I address this ambiguity by formally defining natural resource dependence as over-specialization in the natural resource sectors. I then present an ideal typology and classification scheme for natural resource communities in the United States. The typology has two dimensions---the level of development and the level of economic prosperity---and six mutually exclusive categories---extractive specialized, extractive dependent, non-extractive specialized, non-extractive dependent, hybrid specialized, and hybrid dependent. I classify counties from 2000 to 2015 and find that while extractive dependence decreased over the study period, non-extractive dependence increased.",TRUE,FALSE,Ideal types|Natural resource dependence|Poverty|Rural tourism|United States,2020-04-12T03:33:21.487612,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:33:00.264303,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/citation/,j5skm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xfyug/,xfyug,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8dfc25d6973501c9bd98ef/,5e8dfc25d6973501c9bd98ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j5skm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j5skm,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12357

Using Google Trends to Track Social Responses to COVID-19","We already know which countries have controlled the spread of COVID-19 better and what “good practices” have enabled them to do so. Eventually, some of these policies could be replicated in other countries. But it is not enough to make a well-informed public intervention. We also need quickly available indicators of how actively populations are responding to the virus threat because current changes in social behaviour could mean significant differences in the spread of the COVID-19 in two weeks (after the incubation period). In this article, Pablo Beytía Reyes and Carlos Cruz Infante explore the potential of Google Trends to quickly track social responses to the pandemic. In all the countries that have reached a downward changepoint in the COVID-19 contagion, an “information saturation peak” preceded it: people were massively searching for information on the subject over 2 to 5 days, and about a week after the peak of searches was reached, a decline in the growth trend of coronavirus confirmed cases could be observed. Does it make sense to associate a Google search boom with a decrease in transmission trends? The authors propose that the frequency of searches is a quick indicator of 1) people’ concerns on the virus, 2) the development of a more informed citizenry on how to avoid transmission and 3) active social response to the virus spread, which generally lead to a downward change in the contagion trend.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|COVID-19|crisis management|digital methods|digital trace analysis|epidemic|healthcare policy|public policy|social indicators,2020-04-08T13:31:45.652362,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08T13:31:16.389482,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/citation/,yndb7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8dc333d697350194bda664/,5e8dc333d697350194bda664,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yndb7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yndb7,NA

Reviewing practices, that is, practices of ordering, defining or delineating scientific fields can be understood as an often neglected, yet prevailing textual practice of community building, particularly in novel and emerging research fields, such as synthetic biology. In this article, I aim to explore the structure and content of review articles as a dedicated scholarly genre in synthetic biology, focusing on the period between 2002 and 2012. Based on a theoretical framework combining approaches from genre analysis and the sociology of translation, I explore the different types of review articles one finds in the field, how these review articles deal with or order research in the field, and how they present the field as a whole. I found that modes of legitimation and presentation have changed during the studied period. While in the beginning, review articles referred to the histories of other fields and disciplines, in the more recent years I found a more narrative mode of legitimation whereby synthetic biology is presented as an engineering field with its own history.

Established approaches involve turning databases of radiocarbon-date densities into single summary proxies that cannot fully account for chronological uncertainty. Here, I use simulated data to explore an alternate Bayesian approach that instead models the data as what they are, namely radiocarbon-dated event-counts. The approach involves assessing possible event-count sequences by sampling radiocarbon date densities and then applying MCMC to estimate the parameters of an appropriate count-based regression model. The regressions based on individual sampled sequences were placed in a multilevel framework, which allowed for the estimation of hyperparameters that account for chronological uncertainty in individual event times. Two processes were used to produce simulated data. One represented a simple monotonic change in event-counts and the other was based on a real palaeoclimate proxy record. In both cases, the method produced estimates that had the correct sign and were consistently biased toward zero. These results indicate that the approach is widely applicable and could form the basis of a new class of quantitative models for use in exploring long-term human and environmental processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Bayesian Hierarchical Regression|Hierarchical Radiocarbon-dated Event Count (HiREC) Model|Palaeoclimatology|Radiocarbon Dating,2020-04-08T13:28:01.147759,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08T13:27:35.608756,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/yv64t/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,W.

However, there remains considerable uncertainty in the empirical literature, in part because different studies operationalise the measurement of drug dependency in different ways. Some, for example, use comprehensive and sophisticated clinical instruments, others use simplified screening tools, while some use single-item self-report measures. Whichever the method, each is an attempt to accurately operationalise the manifestation of drug dependency as an objective trait, yet through their mode of administration, they undoubtedly capture other confounds. The resulting bias can have significant implications for the subsequent estimation of the drug crime relationship, especially if a mode of administration (such as the single-measure self-report) crosses over into other important domains such as personal and social identity. The present study examined the correlation between self-reported drug dependency and crime among a large sample of Australian police detainees who were affirmatively screened for dependency on UNCOPE—a six item clinical screening tool which operationalises dependency as the presence of multiple behavioural and affective experiences of compulsive drug use (Hoffmann, Hunt, Rhodes, &amp; Riley, 2003; Proctor &amp; Hoffmann, 2016). Using a mix of descriptive and negative binominal regression techniques, we modelled the frequency of self-reported prior offending in the past 12 months using data from the Drug Use Monitoring in Australia program. After controlling for type, frequency, and longevity of drug use, as well as other demographic factors, we find that those who self-report a drug dependency have higher average rates of prior offending. We argue that these results reflect the social and cultural power of drug-dependency identities and the centrality of identity as a third, often unobserved variable in the drug-crime correlation. These result will assist criminologists and criminal justice professionals in further developing interventions to assist drug dependent offenders within the criminal justice system.",TRUE,FALSE,crime|criminal offending|dependency|drug use|identity|self-report,2020-04-08T13:26:24.035936,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08T13:26:10.199389,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Cameron T.

ReflectingTeachingArtisticResearch.,"The name “Ludics,” is derived from the term “ludus,” meaning “play,” a term that is useful in connection with games and rules of play. As a concept for artistic research, the Ludic method is introduced here as it combines both games and rules of play. Conceptual ludic art explores rules of play, systems of investigation and knowledge acquisition through game mechanics as well as the fundamentals of perception, experience and cognition. The theory and practice of artistic research are concerned with ludic methods of approaching art and science and epistemic things (“Erkenntnisgegnstände”), insights achieved through research. Their goals are written fictitiously, presented participatively and made public processually. The methods of artistic research comprise contradictions, and are found in feedback between peers in conference contributions and in exhibitions, between radical artistic uniqueness and the claim of universal validity (which is required for the validation of artistic research). We need to clarify the scientific understanding of epistemic things, and as a consequence, introduce a new concept of a ludic artistic research epistemé. Ludic objects are artefacts that trigger discourse and the application of certain rules of research. They constitute an interplay of art and knowledge. Teaching this understanding is equally tied to a certain playful approach toward serious, rule-driven research. Following a ludic method, we introduce a new trope to artistic research, the idea of a playful movement in thinking that dissolves the established trope of art as a field with no further connections than aesthetics per se. The ludic objective thus stems from technologies and cultural techniques of insight, as well as theories, experiments and philosophical conceptions that are connected to the perceived, conceived and lived world.",TRUE,FALSE,epistemology|experiments|ludic objects|udic research method,2020-04-07T21:58:31.677709,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-07T19:05:06.485600,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cca|Arts and Humanities|Art Practice,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/citation/,7j32f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8cb7d4f135350134d53be5/,5e8cb7d4f135350134d53be5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7j32f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7j32f,NA
