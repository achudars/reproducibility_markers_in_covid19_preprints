Grounded on the interpretive paradigm, forty two (42) participants were recruited to partake in this study. Further, reflection papers from the participants serve as the narratives of the study and where then reflectively analyze via the process of thematization. 

After the three (3) level of reflective analysis, the following themes were identified: (1) Dedication: Focused Learning; (2) Mastery of Professional Qualities; (3) Setbacks: Stress &amp; Weariness. The themes shows that in general, the overall experience of the participants was affirmative and optimistic claiming that LRSS promotes a conducive learning environment wherein they felt “less pressured” to perform task. Further the participants felt that the LRSS provides them with a mean to fully realize the development of their professional qualities, skills and attitude of a “real” nurse since it mirrors the realities of an “on-the-job-training”. Lastly, the identified setbacks of the LRSS are two-folds: stress and a sense of weariness, largely attribute to the consecutive days of duty schedules as well as a perceived monotony of activities in the area of exposure. 

Insights from this study suggest that there is a need to update and upgrade strategies and methodologies of teaching implemented in the clinical area to provide varied approaches to learning skills as well as limit the perception of monotony among student clinicians. Further research that dwells on the (1) nature of stress, (2) the patterns of coping and adjustment among student clinicians is also implied",TRUE,FALSE,Clinical Rotation|nursing|nursing education|qualitative research|Related Learning Experience,2019-10-16T18:38:01.705481,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16T16:08:14.584078,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d60|Education|Health and Physical Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/citation/,nb8pa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da6d375fcf91f001224c1fd/,5da6d375fcf91f001224c1fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nb8pa/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nb8pa

Spurred on by global economic change, robotization, and the decline of labor unions, state labor markets have shifted away from an occupational regime dominated by the production of goods to one characterized by the provision of services. Prior studies have proposed that deterioration of employment opportunities may be associated with the rise of substance use disorders and drug overdose deaths, yet no clear link between changes in labor market dynamics in the U.S. manufacturing sector and drug overdose deaths has been established. Using restricted-use vital registration records between 1999-2017 that comprise over 700,000 drug deaths, I test two questions. First, what is the association between manufacturing decline and drug and opioid overdose mortality rates? Second, how much of the increase in these drug-related outcomes can be accounted for by manufacturing decline? The findings provide strong evidence that restructuring of the U.S. labor market has played an important upstream role in the current drug crisis. Up to 77,000 overdose deaths for men and up to 40,000 overdose deaths for women are attributable to the decline of state-level manufacturing over this nearly two-decade period. These results persist in models that adjust for other social, economic, and policy trends changing at the same time, including the supply of prescription opioids. Critically, the findings signal the value of policy interventions that aim to reduce persistent economic precarity experienced by individuals and communities, especially the economic strain placed upon the middle class.",TRUE,FALSE,Drug Overdose Deaths|Economic Conditions|Manufacturing Decline|Mortality|Social Determinants,2019-10-16T18:35:40.855844,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16T16:07:42.289077,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course",Nathan Seltzer,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/citation/,cdwap,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da6ae13a7bc73000bee507c/,5da6ae13a7bc73000bee507c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cdwap/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cdwap

Natural resource development generally takes two forms, extractive (e.g. oil and gas, mining, timber) and non-extractive (e.g. tourism, recreation, real estate). However, research has rarely examined both in-tandem. Drawing on the concept of dependence (i.e. over-specialization), I test the hypothesis that increasing levels of both forms of development was associated with diminishing returns to economic prosperity— operationalized as per capita income, inequality, and poverty—in rural America over the period of 2000 to 2015. Extractive development exhibited the expected relationship in remote rural counties for all outcomes, while non-extractive development had a generally negative relationship with per capita income, a positive relationship with poverty, and no relationship with inequality.

There have been many attempts to propose a standard for textual resource interoperability, from the ubiquitous Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format to more recent proposals like the Distributed Text Services (DTS) protocol. In this paper, we critically survey these attempts and introduce our proposal called SHINE, which aims to escape from TEI’s legacy and prioritize instead the ease for software developers to representation and exchange textual resources and their associated metadata. We do so by combining a hierarchical model of textual structure with a flexible metadata scheme in SHINE, and we continue to define and develop it based on user-centered and iterative design principles. Therefore, we argue that SHINE is a protocol for textual interoperability that successfully balances flexibility of resource representation, consistency across resource representation, and overall simplicity of implementation.",TRUE,FALSE,digital humanities|digital resources|digital texts|interoperability|metadata|TEI|textual resources,2019-10-16T18:28:42.234809,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16T16:06:08.289484,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Cataloging and Metadata,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/citation/,qrmg8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bx8pw/,bx8pw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da5a583a7bc73000bed7a68/,5da5a583a7bc73000bed7a68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qrmg8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qrmg8
