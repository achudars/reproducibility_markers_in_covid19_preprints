a growing number of economic sectors. As to the hospitability industry in
particular, recent innovations in the field of digital technologies
prompted the rise of so called Online Travel Agents (OTAs) and the demise
of the traditional merchant model.

Recently national competition authorities (NCAs) in the EU investigated so
called rate parity clauses in the contracts between the three largest OTAs
and their hotel partners. These are contract clauses laying down the
hotelier’s obligation to display the same room prices across sales
channels. The parallel investigations conducted by the NCAs revealed an
array of anticompetitive effects stemming from rate parity obligations.
While the German NCA concluded that there was insufficient evidence of the
efficiency gains of these clauses, and therefore decided to prohibit them,
the French, Italian and Swedish NCAs implicitly recognised that some level
of protection against free-riding was necessary, and accepted commitments
to reduce the scope of the rate parity obligation.

The hotel online booking cases were closely followed in the EU and beyond,
since they could help clarify a number of key assessment issues concerning
a category of commercial practices already widely spread in online markets.
In-depth analyses of the NCAs’ findings are now needed, especially in view
of the promotion of an effective antitrust-based platform regulation. In
particular, this article explores some of the challenges related to the
application of the traditional free-riding defence to rate parity
obligations.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:45.561681,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-21T18:44:01.378000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/citation/,vqhez,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uw66h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/relationships/node/,uw66h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/579117f2594d9001fca988c9/,579117f2594d9001fca988c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqhez/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vqhez/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vqhez

I provide a rigorous foundation for the model by showing that transforming a distribution by exponential weighting (and normalizing) systematically affects the information entropy of the resulting distribution. For weights greater than one the resulting distribution has less information entropy than the original distribution, and vice versa. As the entropy of a distribution measures how informative a decision maker is treating the underlying observation(s), this result suggests a useful interpretation of the weights.

First, I examine three interstellar space projects: NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft; 100 Year Starship’s manifesto on their quest to travel to another star; and SETI’s search for life in the universe. Finally, I turn to corresponding examples of interstellar travel in speculative fiction.

In 2013, NASA announced a transmission from the Voyager 1 spacecraft as the “sound of interstellar space” and marked it as crossing a boundary into the “space between stars.” Organizations like 100 Year Starship and the Interstellar Message Composition program at SETI describe interstellar travel in terms of spacecraft, listening for signals, and active transmission. Fiction and science also co-render humans into interstellar scale via speculative technologies like artificial intelligence, instantaneous travel across the universe by “folding space,” and the “generation ship,” in which generations of crewmembers live and die during a multi-year voyage to another star.

This ethnography of interstellar ontologies across multiple sites and scales builds on feminist science studies (Haraway), recent work on abstractions as scientific things (Helmreich), and the concept of hyperobjects – non-human entities that are massively distributed in time and space (Morton). As interstellar space moves between abstraction, text, place, and object, I find that it unfolds to reveal a constellation of potentially inhabited worlds inscribed by both scientists and speculative fiction; what was remote, insensate, and desolate becomes intimate, poetic, inhabited.

one aspect of the impact of opposing movements: rhetorical strategies. I
examine historical documents produced by social movement organizations to
determine the processes through which interactions between opposing
movements are integrated into the everyday work of producing movement
claims. This historical analysis evaluates the flyers, newsletters, and
press releases of lesbian and gay movement organizations in the United
States over time, comparing documents produced before the emergence of the
Christian antigay countermovement in 1977, with those produced immediately
following the countermovement’s entry into the political scene. I analyze
the shifts in lesbian and gay activists' claims between these two brief
time periods and link these changes to the presence of Christian antigay
activists. I find that frames, tone, and language shift for issues that
were directly addressed by the Christian antigay movement (lesbian and gay
rights), but that no similar change was present for issues on which the
antigay movement remained silent (police harassment and lesbian/gay media
representations). These findings support the claim that opposing movements
alter the political context in which the other side works, but they also

applied to all sorts of programs, organizations, and practices. However,
few studies have specified clearly what safe spaces are and how they
support the people who occupy them. In this paper, we examine one social
location typically understood to be a safe space: gay-straight alliance
groups in high schools. Using qualitative interviews with young adults in
the United States and Canada who have participated in gay-straight
alliances, we examine the experiences of safe spaces in these groups. We
unpack this complex concept to consider some of the dimensions along which
safe spaces might vary. Participants identified several types of safe
space, and from their observations we derive three inter-related dimensions
of safe space: social context, membership and activity.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:02.512804,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-20T19:38:59.865000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/citation/,y6g82,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/npu2s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/relationships/node/,npu2s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578fd3556c613b01eba2ecba/,578fd3556c613b01eba2ecba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6g82/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y6g82/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y6g82
