Pre-formed intact groups were used to conduct this quasi-experimental study. It used a pretest and post-test control group design. The participants were 122 first year university students. Computer-based reading comprehension exercises were used as intervention that   lasted   for   six   weeks.   Vocabulary   was   pre-taught   through   WhatsApp. Post-test results of the reading comprehension achievement test revealed that   the treatment group outperformed their counterparts in the control group. The results indicate the significance of technology incorporation in language learning process. The study shows the effective use of technology in   EFL reading   instruction.   It   works best   when   integrated   in   the   instructional scheme. Results of the study also suggest that freely available technological resources can be used to create a conducive reading environment.

It investigates the effect of the academic attainment of ESL teachers on the evaluation of ESL error seriousness. The educational attainment of teachers, both native and non-native, include the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. Participants in the study include 34 non-native Palestinian ESL teachers, 26 English native speaking ESL teachers, and 10 English native speakers who are not teachers. Errors in this study are taken from compositions written by Arab-Palestinian students. Eight error categories including prepositions, concord, word order, plural, pronouns, spelling, vocabulary, and verb form are used. Four correct sentences are also included. All participants for the study had to underline errors and evaluate them by indicating the points from 0-5 they would deduct for each error; 5 indicates very serious errors; 0 is for error-free sentences; “1” is for errors which can easily be excused; “2”, “3”, and “4” are means to show intermediate degrees of seriousness. Results of the study show that the three academic groups differ in their evaluation of errors. Whereas the Ph.D. groups are the most lenient, the M.A. groups are the least tolerant.

The purpose of the current study was to test the correlation between the independent variables (including, level of social media use, interactivity with peers, interactivity with teachers, active cooperative learning, engagement) and the dependent variable (i.e., learning performance) of female Saudi students in a sex-segregated educational system.  A cross-sectional survey was administered to 283 participants, representing 15.8% of the target population of female Saudi students enrolled on a distance learning course at King Abdulaziz University.  The data were analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling, to generate and validate the Social Media-Learning Performance (SM-LP) model. The SM-LP model predicted with a substantial effect size (R2 = 67.7%) that female Saudi students perceived that they could potentially improve their learning performance, in a sex-segregated education system, through high levels of social media use, stimulating inter activity with peers and teachers, as well as active collaborative learning, and engagement.

Using Google Scholar with the exact topics as search terms, 50 research reports were obtained. The results obtained from the critical analysis of the methodologies used in these reports are discussed in this review. Most studies were on power distance and individualism/collectivism dimensions of culture. A large number of conceptual frameworks and as many as 121 measurement instruments have been proposed by different workers. Research approach in any particular study is determined by the framework and the instrument chosen or self-developed instruments. Surveys and interviews are more commonly used. Not estimating internal consistency or reliability tests in some works makes it difficult to judge the validity of the method of data analysis. Generally the sample size is in the range of 200-500 participants in surveys. Small sample sizes used in a few works may affect the validity and applicability of their findings. It is concluded that large groups of scientists doing a common research programme across several countries is better than individual researches.

Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space.
This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, autonomy types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (emails), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test.

Examining Object-Relations in a Postwork Society.,"In this article we look at repair as an emergent focus of recent activism in affluent societies, where a number of groups are reclaiming practices of repair as a form of political and ecological action. Ranging from those that fight for legislative change to those groups who are trying to support ecological and social change through everyday life practices, repair is beginning to surface tensions in everyday life and as such poses opportunities for its transformation. We survey a few of
the practices that make up this movement in its various articulations, to take stock of their current political import.
While we suggest that these practices can be seen as an emergent lifestyle movement, they should not be seen as presenting a unified statement. Rather, we aim to show that they articulate a spectrum of political positions, particularly in relation to the three specific issues of property, pedagogy and sociality. These three dimensions are all facets of current internal discrepancies of repair practices and moreover express potential bifurcations as this movement evolves. Drawing on a diverse methodology that includes discourse analysis and participant observation, we suggest some of the ways in which this growing area of activity could play a significant role in resisting the commodification of the everyday and inventing postwork alternatives.",TRUE,FALSE,commons|feminist pedagogy|object-relations|postwork|property|repair,2018-07-02T10:55:08.647101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-05T11:33:04.599623,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/citation/,7um9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3mevh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/relationships/node/,3mevh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e4d4be9ad5a1022ff4d307/,58e4d4be9ad5a1022ff4d307,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7um9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7um9v/,https://doi.org/10.1080/09502386.2017.1298638,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7um9v

The dual nature of networks creates a challenge – if the observed network ties are a single random draw, is it realistic to expect that diffusion only follows the observed network ties?  This study takes a first step towards integrating these two perspectives by introducing a social space diffusion model.  In the model, network ties indicate positions in social space, and diffusion occurs proportionally to distance in social space.  Practically, the simulation occurs in two parts.  First, positions are estimated using a statistical model (in this example, a latent space model).  Then, second, the predicted probabilities of a tie from that model – representing the distances in social space – or a series of networks drawn from those probabilities – representing routine churn in the network – are used as weights in a weighted averaging framework.  Using longitudinal data from high school friendship networks, I explore the properties of the model.  I show that the model produces smoothed diffusion results, which predict attitudes in future waves 10% better than a diffusion model using the observed network, and up to 5% better than diffusion models using alternative, non-model-based smoothing approaches.",TRUE,FALSE,social networks,2018-07-02T10:55:08.511477,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-04T20:14:54.418604,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/citation/,cgftk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2phst/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/relationships/node/,2phst,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e3fe40b83f69023611390f/,58e3fe40b83f69023611390f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgftk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cgftk/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0081175018820075,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cgftk
