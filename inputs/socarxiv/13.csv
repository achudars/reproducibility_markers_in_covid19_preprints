Decades of research in social sciences have variously offered insights into understanding how such bold transformations might occur. However, these insights remain disjunct and of limited scope, providing only partial explanations on the processes of change required for solving global environmental challenges. Reductionist approaches tend to focus on micro-level changes within the individual, largely assuming that social structures and norms would shift incrementally as a result of individual behavior change. On the other hand, holistic, social structural approaches tend to describe how macro-level changes occur, while generally glossing over individual differences in terms of values, motivations and personal characteristics. There is an urgent need to integrate these two approaches in order to understand how individual actions influence and are in turn influenced by social structures and norms. In this paper, we synthesize a range of insights across these two different schools of thought and integrate them in a novel framework for transformative social change. One key distinction we make to bridge individual and collective perspectives lies between individual actions that comprise the practice itself and those that push for a broader societal change in practice. Our conceptual framework explains the interconnected relationships among individual behaviors, collective actions, and social-structural arrangements and suggests how these interdependent processes can together instigate both behavioral and societal change. We apply this general framework in the context of global wildlife trade and identify a variety of pathways towards transformative change.",TRUE,FALSE,Collective action|Global wildlife trade|Integrative framework|Pro-environmental behavior|Social-ecological systems|Social norm|Transformative social change,2021-02-16T06:12:41.339309,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-16T06:12:21.994967,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,Rumi Naito,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/citation/,5zmxd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602ad3e938d71900097440dd/,602ad3e938d71900097440dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zmxd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zmxd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5zmxd

In particular, consensus is lacking on how to conceptualize different aspects of sexual wellbeing among young people. We propose a new conceptual framework for adolescent sexual wellbeing that draws on existing theories and definitions, grounded in theories related to positive youth development, empowerment, human rights, gender, social-ecological and life-course perspectives. The framework highlights six interrelated domains of key competencies that are central to healthy adolescent sexuality development, whether or not sexual activities occur: 1) sexual literacy, 2) gender equal attitudes, 3) respect for human rights and understanding consent, 4) critical reflection skills, 5) coping skills and 6) interpersonal skills. These competencies have the potential both to strengthen and impede adolescents‚Äô sexual wellbeing in relation to both themselves and others. Personal sexual wellbeing includes, but is not limited to, having a positive sense of one‚Äôs own (sexual) self and body, and recognising and appreciating feelings of pleasure and desire. Relational sexual wellbeing can include developing and maintaining mutually respectful, gender equal relationships with other people that are that are part of young people‚Äôs sexual socialisation, such as peers, parents and community members. Over time, relational sexual wellbeing may also include outcomes related to intimate partners, such as equality in relationships, safe and pleasurable sexual interactions, free from violence and coercion. Whether young people are able to translate competencies into desired actions and achieve a sense of sexual wellbeing depends on the personal, social and economic resources available to them, their (sexual) agency, and on the influence of opportunity structures such as policies, laws and norms.

This study also examines whether the impact of the family varies significantly by age. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, an event history analysis is conducted to address how the mechanisms of social learning by family affect the timing and types of first union formation.  This research shows an individual with lower parental relationship quality and parental divorce cohabit during adolescence and early adulthood to leave the familial conflict home environment.  Furthermore, intact family and higher relationship quality between parents are associated with a greater likelihood of marriage than cohabitation. This study suggests that parental divorce during adolescence affects the timing and types of the first union formation. In contrast, parental divorce in the later stage of the transition to adulthood is not associated with the first family formation behavior. Although young adults with different levels of parental relationship quality had the same rates of marriage, lower marital relationship quality is associated with higher rates of cohabitating. Adolescents who suffer from parental divorce and lower parental relationship quality with better socioeconomic status have lower rates of cohabitating but the same odds of marrying with lower socioeconomic status counterparts.

In their recent paper, however, Silva et al. propose that the high fertility of ADE is not of anthropic origin but instead the result of alluvial deposition starting in the Middle Holocene (8200-4200 cal BP). In order to support this argument, they marshal data and observations from a single expanse of ADE, the archaeological site of Caldeir√£o, and disregard or misread other studies of ADEs in the Central Amazon region. Silva et al.'s claim, an epilogue to ‚Äògeogenic‚Äô models laid to rest over 40 years ago, also dismisses research showing how long-term anthropic soil enrichment occurs as a result of daily practices at contemporary indigenous settlements.

Yet few researchers have studied immigrants in same-sex couples on a large scale. Using the American Community Survey from 2008 to 2019, this study compares immigrants in same-sex couples to corresponding different-sex couples in order to characterize and assess the scale of ‚Äúsexual migration‚Äù to the U.S. Moreover, we evaluate how the policy environment regarding same-sex couples shapes migratory patterns. We find that, compared to different-sex immigrant couples, immigrants in same-sex couples come from richer, more democratic countries that are less represented in immigrant networks. Fixed effects models show that as origin countries become more LGBT-friendly, we see more LGB immigrants from those countries in the U.S. On the individual level, immigrants in same-sex couples are more likely to live in progressive U.S. states, an effect that increases in strength as migrants come from for more LGBT-friendly countries of origin. Our findings put into question dominant models of migration that emphasize economic and network effects, suggesting the importance of considering sexuality as well as political and lifestyle motivations more broadly.",TRUE,FALSE,immigration|LGBTQ policy|same-sex couples|sexuality,2021-02-15T19:20:22.321427,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15T19:19:21.358577,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/citation/,hxjkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6029afe723238302fc9d9011/,6029afe723238302fc9d9011,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hxjkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hxjkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hxjkt

We study the impact of a 1996 law that created local government with electoral quotas for Scheduled Tribes, a historically marginalized and impoverished community of 100 million in India. Using difference-in-differences designs paired with remote sensing data on deforestation, we find that formal representation reduces the rate of deforestation by thirty percent. These effects are larger in villages close to mines, where representation likely lowered commercial extraction. Combining these findings with research that the same institutions improved economic outcomes, our results challenge the commonly held assumption that there must be a trade-off between development and protecting the environment. While conservation policy tends to comprise environmentally focused institutions, we suggest more attention be given to umbrella institutions, such as political representation, which can address conservation and development in tandem.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-15T19:24:01.441980,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15T19:21:41.291289,FALSE,NA,no,sources listed; substantial preprocessing required,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/citation/,3uvmc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6029769d23238302ec9d6653/,6029769d23238302ec9d6653,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvmc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3uvmc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3uvmc
