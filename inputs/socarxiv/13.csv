I focus on six non-religious and recurrent topics that feature in the sermons, namely business, family, nationalism, health, trust, and patience. I demonstrate that the content of the sermons respond strongly to events of national importance. I then link the Friday sermons with ~4.8 million tweets on these topics to study whether and how the content of sermons affects social media behaviour. I find generally large effects of the sermons on tweets, but there is also heterogeneity by topic. It is strongest for nationalism, patience, and health and weakest for business. Overall, these results show that religious institutions in Turkey are influential in shaping the public’s social media content and that this influence is mainly prevalent on salient issues.

How Context and Time Shape  Immigrants' Trust in the Police in Europe,"The relationships between police and minorities have received increasing interest in many Western societies in recent years. We examine first-generation immigrants’ trust in the police in Europe from a comparative and longitudinal perspective. On the contextual level, we test the impact of police size on trust and, on the individual level, we analyze the role of assimilation processes and discrimination experiences. We draw upon data of roughly 21,500 immigrants observed in 24 countries over 13 years contained in the European Social Survey. Results show that immigrants in countries with more police trust the police less, which is partly, but not fully, explained by cross-national differences in crime, rule of law, and GDP. However, there is no longitudinal effect of police size within countries, mostly because the national police size hardly changes over time. On the individual level, we show that initially high levels of trust in the police among immigrants tend to erode with length of stay in a country. We argue that two simultaneous processes drive this pattern: A fading reference effect (downward assimilation) and an increasing discrimination effect. We discuss implications for future research and policy development based on this reasoning.",TRUE,FALSE,Europe|European Social Survey|Immigrants|Police|Trust,2021-05-11T14:20:26.804995,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-11T12:05:23.212127,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://europeansocialsurvey.org/|https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/citation/,3xcpn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609a67796801ab069d2a930c/,609a67796801ab069d2a930c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xcpn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3xcpn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3xcpn

To examine the association between wage-setting policy and food insecurity.

Methods. We estimated multilevel regression models, using data from the Gallup World Poll (2014–2017) and UCLA’s World Policy Analysis Center, to examine the association between wage setting policy and food insecurity across 139 countries (n = 492 078).

Results. Compared with countries with little or no minimum wage, the probability of being food insecure was 0.10 lower (95% confidence interval = 0.02, 0.18) in countries with collective bargaining. However, these associations varied across employment status. More generous wage-setting policies (e.g., collective bargaining or high minimum wages) were associated with lower food insecurity among full-time workers (and, to some extent, part-time workers) but not those who were unemployed.

Conclusions. In countries with generous wage-setting policies, employed adults had a lower risk of food insecurity, but the risk of food insecurity for the unemployed was unchanged.

Practicing AWD in rice production can reduce water consumption by 30% and mitigate methane emissions by 30-70% without yield penalty. Primary research was conducted in Rangpur, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, and Sherpur Divisions. The analysis depicts the dynamic among the stakeholders involved in outscaling AWD using the Net-Map tool, and demonstrates the influence of irrigation management systems in the selected catchment areas and the impacts of AWD in rice farming. Findings reveal that AWD-practicing farmers, pump owners, and the Upazila Irrigation Committee are the three most powerful influencers for outscaling AWD. The pre-paid irrigation system significantly improves water efficiency and cost-effectiveness when practising AWD. Additionally, AWD leads to a lower frequency of pumping resulting in reduced costs compared to the continuous-flooding practice. Finally, the results guide the formulation of recommendations to create favourable conditions for AWD outscaling, which contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing sustainable rice production in Bangladesh.",TRUE,FALSE,alternate wetting and drying|climate-smart agriculture|institutional analysis|irrigation management|low-emissions rice,2021-05-12T14:56:03.465137,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-12T14:55:12.766510,FALSE,NA,no,Contact authors directly for anonymized data.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/citation/,snq2u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/609a2d846801ab06902a59dc/,609a2d846801ab06902a59dc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snq2u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/snq2u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/snq2u

However, studies have shown hesitation towards COVID-19 vaccination uptake and a lack of trust in government agencies; putting children at risk for not receiving preventative medical care. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between trust in public health agencies and parental intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. 
Methods: Residents of a Midwestern state who reported being parent/guardian of one or more child, aged &lt;18 living at home, were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey conducted during September-October 2020 (n=238). Participants were asked their level of trust in both state and local public health departments and if they planned on vaccinating their children against COVID-19. Resident geography, rural, suburban, and urban, was categorized using definitions from the Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA) and matched to participant county of residence. Descriptive and binomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to predict probability of vaccine intent for children.
Results:. Among participants, 132 (55.5%) reported intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Factors that were found to significantly decrease probability of vaccinating child were being a rural resident and lower level of trust in both state and local public health agencies.  
Discussion: Results from this study highlight the importance of addressing public health agency  mistrust among individuals, regardless of geography, to assure more equitable vaccine delivery. Further, special focus may be needed for those living in more isolated, less populated areas, where a higher level of trust may be needed before parents vaccinate their children.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-12T14:55:47.681142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-12T14:54:33.465241,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be accessed by request.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Saint Louis University,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/citation/,9f3r6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6099718d6801ab06212aaebf/,6099718d6801ab06212aaebf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9f3r6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9f3r6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9f3r6

Despite a rich literature, however, it is not well understood how media exposure influences attitudes towards immigrants. In contrast to previous studies, we argue that people rely on 'availability heuristics' shaped by mass media. From that point of view, it is the specific content of media discourse on immigration that affects people's concerns. We use 'Structural Topic Models' to classify media content of more than 24.000 articles of leading German newspapers from 2001 to 2016. Utilizing 'linear fixed effect models' allows us to relate a person's concern towards immigration as reported in the German Socioeconomic Panel to prevalent topics discussed in print media while controlling for several confounding factors (e.g., party preferences, interest in politics, etc.). We find a robust relationship between topic salience and attitudes towards integration. Our results also reveal that specific topics with negative contents (e.g., domestic violence) to increase concerns, while others (e.g., scientific studies, soccer) decrease concerns substantially, underlining the importance of available information provided by media. In addition, people with higher education are generally less affected by media salience of topics.",TRUE,FALSE,German Socioeconomic Panel|Immigration|Mass Media|Structural Topic Model,2021-05-10T13:25:42.008658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-10T13:24:53.711764,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,Lukas Erhard,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/citation/,3vuy2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6098f76b6801ab05fb2a6b99/,6098f76b6801ab05fb2a6b99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vuy2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3vuy2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3vuy2
