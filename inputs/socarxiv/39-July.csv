Evidence From Five Decades of Swedish Taxation Data,"As with many social transfer schemes, pension systems around the world are often progressive: individuals with lower incomes receive a higher percentage of their income as a subsequent pension. On the other hand, it is well known that those with lower earnings have higher mortality and thus accumulate fewer years of pension income. These opposite factors, therefore, both contribute to the progressiveness of a given pension system. Thus far, empirical research efforts to disentangle the effects of mortality inequality on lifetime pension income have been scarce. To close this gap, we use Swedish taxation data linked with death registers from 1970 to 2018 to study how education and pre-retirement earnings relate to lifetime pension income from age 60 onwards, as well as how inequalities in mortality between groups contribute to overall inequalities in lifetime pension income. The results show that both a progressive replacement structure and mortality differentials contribute to the overall distribution of life-course pension payments. A substantial proportion of the total inequality in lifetime pensions can be attributed to the fact that socially advantaged groups live longer, and this is particularly true for men. Mortality differences can explain up to 28% of the lifetime pension benefits between socioeconomic groups. We conclude that inequalities in mortality play an important part in determining the overall degree of between-group income transfers in a pension system.",TRUE,FALSE,mortality inequality|pension progressivity|Sweden,2021-05-25T10:29:43.234502,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:29:31.411720,FALSE,NA,no,Registration data not publicly available.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/citation/,b78e9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60abe6dd0b6c69023c9b819c/,60abe6dd0b6c69023c9b819c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b78e9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b78e9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b78e9,NA

With growing availability of multi-wave surveys, social scientists are increasingly turning to latent trend models applied to survey data for examining changes in social and political attitudes. With the aim of facilitating this research, our study compares different approaches to modeling latent trends of aggregate public opinion: splines, Gaussian processes, and discrete autoregressive models. We examine the ability of these models to recover latent trends with simulated data that vary with regard to the frequency and magnitude of changes in the true trend, model complexity and data availability. Overall, we find that all three latent trend models perform well in all scenarios, even the most difficult ones with frequent and weak changes of the latent trend and sparse data. The two main performance differences we find include the relatively higher squared errors of autoregressive models compared to the other models, and the under-coverage of posterior intervals in high-frequency low-amplitude trends with splines. For all models and across all scenarios performance improves with increased data availability, which emphasizes the need of supplying sufficient data for accurate estimation of latent trends.",TRUE,FALSE,autoregressive models|Gaussian processes|latent trend models|public opinion|splines|survey data,2021-05-25T10:22:07.261227,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:21:41.520959,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/citation/,gauvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j45er/,j45er,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60abcdbf8a5d3d02250cc599/,60abcdbf8a5d3d02250cc599,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gauvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gauvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gauvx,NA

Through the work of extraction studies, we know that much of this matter is violently pulled from the ground—the metals in electronic devices, for instance, were cut out of the earth. Previous work in new materialist STS has critiqued the construction of the ‘object’ as obscuring how things work and are made, yet the role of extraction in things has gone largely unacknowledged. In this paper, I argue that extraction is a core element of contemporary technoscience. I define the term dis-origining to analytically describe the way that objects are made to seem as if they come from nowhere, within and far beyond the STS literature, comparing this term with related concepts including Haraway’s (1988) god-trick and Marx’s commodity fetish.

Drawn from the city register of Duisburg, a metropolis of 500,000 inhabitants, voters eligible for the September 2021 Bundestag elections are the target population. They are stratified into four groups by onomastic classification: native Germans, Germans of Turkish Descent, Germans with a (Post-) Soviet background and Germans of any other immigrant origin. This note presents ten measures of optimising the recruitment of individuals from these four groups under the constraints of an all-encompassing high-incidence pandemic with distance measures and curfews in place, with closed shops and schools and reduced other care facilities. In addition, the report puts forward statistical analyses of some measures applied in an experimental design and estimates the overall and per-person-recruited costs. 
Overall, the pandemic forced us to make drastic changes to research design and field organisation and to invest much more time and money than planned. Especially overburdened postal deliveries and restrictive policies for public places made the endeavour most difficult. So far, the ongoing fieldwork has produced a response rate of 8.2 % (only individuals willing to participate in telephone interview) with 11.0 % as a likely expected outcome. One individual recruited to take part in the telephone panel survey costs an estimated 53-71 €.
Early-bird incentives produced a positive response (meaning the willingness to partake in the survey) of 5.5 % compared to 4.0 % among those without early-bird incentives. The most effective measure to boost overall positive response among initial non-responders was in-person canvassing with unconditional incentive (21.3 %) instead of postal reminders (9.9 %). Canvassing a smaller group of people in person proved to be as costly as reminding a larger group of people in writing: we estimated costs of 60-61 € per additionally recruited survey participants through either channel.",TRUE,FALSE,canvassing|corona|covid-19|election|immigration|incentive|reminder|response|response rate|survey|voting,2021-05-25T10:26:23.765912,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:25:59.354837,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/citation/,dpz9q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60abaf998a5d3d020f0cc717/,60abaf998a5d3d020f0cc717,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dpz9q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dpz9q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dpz9q,NA

However, contrary to this general finding, illicit drug offence detections increased significantly. In this study, we explore the geographical distribution of the increase in Queensland, Australia, using spatiotemporal generalised additive model (GAM) to identify locations in the Local Government Area (LGA) of Brisbane where drug offence detection rates were unusually high during the three months of the COVID-19 lockdown (April-June 2020). Contrary to expectation, we find that the increase in drug offence detection rates appears to have been modest in most places, but widespread and diffuse throughout the city. We conclude that drug offence detections are most likely to have increased incidentally, probably as a consequence of general street policing initiatives which saw an increase in the visibility and vulnerability of drug user communities. We do, however, identify five locations in Brisbane where the drug offence detection rate exceeded the prediction by a considerable margin (in one case, more than double the worst case prediction). We argue that in these locations the increase was likely the result of some spatial displacement of inner-city drug markets coupled with a series of targeted policing activities.

We find that priming the COVID-19 pandemic increases altruism and reciprocity towards compatriots, citizens of other EU countries, and non-EU citizens. Priming common European values also boosts altruism and reciprocity but only towards compatriots and fellow Europeans. Priming common economic interests has no tangible impact on behaviour. Trust in others is not affected by any treatment. Our results are consistent with the parochial altruism hypothesis, which asserts that because altruism arises out of inter-group conflict, humans show a tendency to favor members of their own groups.",TRUE,FALSE,altruism|COVID-19|Europe|reciprocity|survey experiment,2021-05-24T11:46:06.036203,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-24T11:45:49.843751,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/6164,prereg_analysis,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/citation/,q9y7b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ab31d48a5d3d01e60cecaf/,60ab31d48a5d3d01e60cecaf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9y7b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q9y7b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q9y7b,NA

This paper focuses on the relationship between neighborhood walkability and the changing walking behavior of 514 individuals during these lockdowns. The spatial context of this relationship highlights three main urban design aspects of the novel and innovative urban neighborhood planning: walkable access, spatial proximity, and social cohesion. This study demonstrates how restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 Pandemic affect the walking behaviors of the individuals, within 15-20 minute walkable and non-walkable neighborhoods located in different socio-economic geographies from American, European, Asian, Western Pacific, African, and Eastern Mediterranean cities. The discussion section of the methodology is supported by a survey questionnaire conducted in 24 disparate neighborhoods. Our data obtained from survey questionnaires is indicating that lockdown restrictions during the Pandemic influenced the walking purpose. Research findings also reflect limitations during the Pandemic complicate individuals’ requiring access to amenities in urban neighborhoods. With a nod to future studies on this topic, this paper proposes a basic framework as well as a thematic analysis with superimposed polar matrix charts.",TRUE,FALSE,15 minutes neighborhood|COVID-19 pandemic|Health|Urban Planning|Walkability,2021-05-25T10:22:42.080573,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-25T10:22:27.245296,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/citation/,69n4m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ab1adba480c601bf0d1a54/,60ab1adba480c601bf0d1a54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69n4m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69n4m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69n4m,NA

He hoped that in return, the Sultanate would reward him with another Eyalet to rule alongside Egypt, but that never happened. Since Muhammad Ali had far-reaching political ambitions, he decided to annex the Levant due to its strategic, economic and demographic importance. So he took advantage of the turmoil and the state of weakness that the Ottoman Empire was going through, and sent an army to the Levant, conquering it with ease, forcing the Sultan to recognize this new situation due to European Pressures, and in order to maintain peace throughout the Empire. Muhammad Ali Pasha’s annexation of the Levant resulted in its exposure to many dangers as a result of the increase in Western interference in its internal affairs, which in return was the result of Muhammad Ali Pasha’s alliance with France, whose influence increased consequently in the Levant under the Pasha’s rule. This prompted the rest of the European powers to work on preserving their interests in the region, which had a long term negative effect on the Ottoman Sultanate and its subjects.",TRUE,FALSE,Ibrahim Pasha|Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali’s Dynasty|Ottoman-Egyptian war|Ottoman Empire|The Eastern Question|The Egyptian era in the Levant|The Sick man of Europe|Western ambitions in the Arab countries,2021-06-01T04:00:26.998861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-29T17:05:23.102161,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd7|Arts and Humanities|History|Islamic World and Near East History,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/citation/,5vabq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60aab14a8a5d3d01c00c9424/,60aab14a8a5d3d01c00c9424,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vabq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5vabq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5vabq,https://doi.org/10.33193/JALHSS.67.2021.480
