The purpose of this study is an attempt to understand the factors that attract tourists to visit Malaysia. The primary data were collected through questionnaire survey on 735 tourists who visited the state of Melaka, Malaysia. This study used descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modelling (SEM) in order to analyze and draw the inferences. Model fit was initially tested using the overall fit and regression paths. Then the hypothesized model was analysed and modified based on the results of the analysis to find a better fit of the data and to more adequately describe the relationships between the factors.

His performance not only objects to Iranian culture industry, but also emphasizes the importance of an audience as well a proper space in furthering this act. The paper will deconstruct this act of rebellion by scrutinizing the local culture industry in Iran, and then contrasting it with the atmosphere created in this particular underground setting. It will attempt to understand the impact of such a small-scale performance in the grand scheme of the country’s youth movement, and it will analyze the importance of space in engendering it. By manipulating and satirizing the common sounds of the Iranian culture industry in a small, underground concert space, artists such as Bozkido provide a tiny fraction of Tehran’s student population shelter from the atmosphere above-ground, while also fostering a new technocultural community in the city centered on music and cohesion.",TRUE,FALSE,electronic music|iran|music|musicology,2019-02-28T16:36:07.854170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T16:35:29.972128,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d44|Arts and Humanities|Music|Musicology,Undergraduate Awards (UA),2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/citation/,t4wfs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c771c158d5d98001a3d976f/,5c771c158d5d98001a3d976f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4wfs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t4wfs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t4wfs,NA

The expulsion of large numbers of Roma individuals, accompanied by other discriminatory practices and forms of hostility, exclusion and violence against the Roma across Europe, has brought the attention of the media and policy makers to Roma issues to a greater extent than ever before during the last decade. The range of problems still afflicting the lives of many Roma nowadays is extremely wide, well researched and profusely documented. This contribution leaves aside issues related to free movement and EU citizenship, thus moving the debate beyond the narrow framework of the ‘migrant Roma’. The contribution considers the wide range of relevant EU competences in this field, and assesses how comprehensive and appropriate the EU’s approach to Roma issues is. The analysis combines legal instruments, policy papers, and case law, draws from legal and non-legal literature, and integrates considerations of social, economic and cultural nature. In the process, this contribution considers themes that cut across several strands of the EU’s Roma policy, including fundamental rights, intercultural sensitivity, the limits of the ‘integration model’, and issues of enforcement, monitoring and funding. The logical narrative developed puts together the key jigsaw pieces that currently contribute to a EU Roma policy, and clearly identifies the limitations of the current state of affairs.

We investigate whether the rise of immigration influenced the novel and salient outcome of preferences for greater law enforcement spending. We propose that these preferences are consequential for policymaking, reflect popular demand for punitive social control, and represent micro-level preferences underlying the politics of criminal justice. Motivated by literatures on criminal justice politics, minority threat, and the fear of crime, we examine whether stocks and flows of immigration influence individual-level preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data, we analyze between-country variation with multi-level models of 25 countries in 2006, and within-country variation with differences-in-differences (DD) models of 16 countries with available data in both 1996 and 2006. Both multilevel and DD models show that flows of immigration increase preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Indeed, the coefficients for immigration flows are larger than or comparable in magnitude to the coefficients for any other variable, and are robust net of homicide rates and police officers per 100,000. By contrast, the stock of immigrants is not robustly associated with preferences. The results demonstrate that rising immigration contributed to increasing public support for greater law enforcement spending.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-27T21:33:46.452115,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-27T21:33:06.712957,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",Joshua J Fink; David Brady,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/citation/,92zwa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a76hd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/relationships/node/,a76hd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c76e7de82a3950019cff719/,5c76e7de82a3950019cff719,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92zwa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92zwa,NA

change due to fundamental shifts in the way data is generated, collected and processed. In order to address this challenge, several large scale social surveys have been integrated into the European Strategic Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI). This has allowed them to develop specialized and professionalized survey work flows within an integrated infrastructural context. This allows for greater sustainability through investment in survey methodologies and data collection which advance the field of social science. This paper examines three case studies within the ESFRI framework; The Survey of Health &amp; Retirement (SHARE) and the European Social Survey (ESS) are European Research Infrastructure Consortia and are both landmarks within the ESFRI landscape. The third case study is of the Generations &amp; Gender Programme which is an Emerging Community in the ESFRI landscape. The three case studies are used to illustrate the developments but also the persistent challenges for social surveys as they evolve with the framework of European Research Infrastructures.

Recent literature shows that parents generally accept their 
lesbian and gay children. However, parents do not always accept them immediately after they  come out. Acceptance takes time, and transitioning to acceptance is often a complex process that depends on parents’ access to the   necessary resources for coping with the stresses of knowing that their child identifies as lesbian or gay. These resources include counseling or therapy, supportive friends and extended family, and a network of other parents with lesbian and gay children. This study also highlights the need for further research on parental acceptance in non-traditional families and of children with other non-heterosexual identities, such as asexuality, gray ace, bisexuality, or pansexuality.

Unfortunately, however, these techniques have often been developed within disciplinary silos and without broad exposure to other potentially interested constituencies. In this paper, we traverse the literatures of social science, computer science, and statistics to examine a variety of modeling techniques for understanding neighborhood dynamics. We begin our review by examining early concepts of spatial structure first outlined in the Chicago School and discuss how the notions of social ecology and quantitative neighborhood analysis permeated the urban studies for several decades to come. Our survey continues by reviewing contemporary statistical approaches for identifying urban neighborhoods, culminating with the state of the art in subfields known as `geodemographics' and `regionalization'. Following this review, we offer insight into the field's persistent conceptual issues, identify areas ripe for additional research, and highlight newly-developed computational methods that can inform more just and socially equitable public policy, community development, and accountable governance.",TRUE,FALSE,ecometrics|factorial ecology|geodemographics|neighbrorhoods|regionalization|social area analysis,2019-02-27T11:29:07.443132,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-27T11:25:39.467112,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/citation/,3frcz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c75b4b582a3950018cd7849/,5c75b4b582a3950018cd7849,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3frcz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3frcz,NA
