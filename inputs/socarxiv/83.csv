Previous research suggests that people often underestimate the extent of inequality and that rising inequality aggravates misperceptions. Our study deepens the understanding of the multi-layered processes that form meritocratic beliefs, and it identifies key factors at the macro-, meso-, and micro-level. A macro-level factor that proved influential was a cultural script revolving around the Danish lay concept, social arv [social inheritance]. At the meso level, the factor of reference groups in socio-economic heterogeneous schools was instrumental for formations of inequality perceptions, but in dissimilar ways depending on micro-level subjective factors. Overall, the participants viewed the free educational system in Denmark as a part of a welfare system that equalises opportunity structures in principle, while the majority simultaneously exhibited a nuanced awareness of social forces negating meritocracy in practice.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-19T22:46:31.665338,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T22:46:11.577005,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/citation/,tj5cu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602fc36d34d3040175e3c573/,602fc36d34d3040175e3c573,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tj5cu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tj5cu,NA

Considering multiple background futures instead of one single projection in building time-dependent inventories for assessing LFCE solutions would greatly enhance the robustness of the decision support provided by environmental assessments such as Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). Here, we reviewed, through automatized and manual text-mining, six internationally well-recognized global environmental scenario studies and one intelligence report. The aim was to uncover the key variables and cause-effect relationships at play in these scenario studies. Through constructing causal loop diagrams for each reviewed study, we identified the variables with the greatest number of causal connections, the “cause” and “effect” variables, and revealed the most reported cause-effect relationships across all studies. Our main findings are: (1) the top 5 causal variables are mitigation policies, technological progress, consumers’ awareness, economic growth and education level, while (2) the top 5 affected variables are climate change, materials use, food security, natural ecosystems, and social justice. Amongst the top 10 causal and affected variables (3), 68 connected pairs were identified with no disagreement in their causal relationship directions. The three most reported pairs were (4) mitigation policy → climate change, healthy and sustainable diet → land use, and population → materials use (each reported in four studies). Finally, (5) we highlighted that all the reviewed studies are based on the decision-making logic of maximizing utility. We concluded that identifying these key cause-effect variables and relationships was essential for building time-dependent inventories in LCA, and that these may be a more useful input than the direct use of any of the scenario reviewed herein.",TRUE,FALSE,bioeconomy|causal loop diagram|complex system|gamechangers|prospective life cycle assessment|scenarios|ssps|systems thinking,2021-02-19T22:46:02.298873,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T22:45:38.749415,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/citation/,mb68h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ph97s/,ph97s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602f9ae14ad52e016e6e28e2/,602f9ae14ad52e016e6e28e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb68h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mb68h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mb68h,NA

Our results from scraped sexual service advertisements show that the pandemic has had measurable impact on online advertising for sex trafficking in the United States, with a significant decrease associated with stay-at-home orders followed by an increase to levels well above prepandemic levels as Covid-related restrictions were relaxed. We contribute to the policy landscape by showing that the initial decrease was associated with a loss of demand for sexual services due to pandemic-related health concerns, but that a confluence of factors, including the lack of economic and social support, increased the number of people vulnerable to being exploited. This study can assist policy makers in predicting future changes in the sex industry to support a more just and inclusive society.

Yet, our understanding of what causes this divergence in experiences is limited. Adopting propositions from the labour market segmentation literature, I show that, similarly to offline markets, online labour markets are composed of structurally delimited segments with different social processes governing the allocation of work. Using unsupervised clustering techniques from network science, I show that the clustered skill topology constrains mobility between segments in online platforms. I also show that this segmentation explains large differences in the earnings potential of individual workers. Together, these results provide a new explanation for the persistence of diversified experiences in online labour markets and inform strategies for future research of online platforms as highly segmented labour markets.",TRUE,FALSE,clustering|finite mixture models|labour market segmentation|network analysis|online labour markets,2021-02-19T08:55:45.489661,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T08:54:34.657913,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,Martin Lukac,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/citation/,m7ah4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602ed67d4ad52e01156e243b/,602ed67d4ad52e01156e243b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7ah4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m7ah4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m7ah4,NA

Policy-motivated political parties develop ideologies, and voters choose the ideology that best explains their observations. Preferences over policies are then induced by the adopted ideology. We show that in equilibrium political parties always propose different models of the world. This divergence extends to all features of the environment, not just policy dimensions. The degree of divergence on policy dimensions increases after periods of policy stability and falls after periods of policy change.",TRUE,FALSE,electoral competition|ideology,2021-02-19T08:51:42.929851,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T08:51:29.004934,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,Federica Izzo|Gregory J.
