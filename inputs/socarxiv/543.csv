The extent of hedging activities disclosures is captured through a 32-item-template, which consists of a mandatory and voluntary disclosure scores. The results of this study indicate that the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure is still insufficient among the sampled companies even though the disclosure scored is quite high. This study also examines the relationship between the existence of risk management committee (RMC), its characteristics and the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure in two separate statistical models. The regression results imply that the existence of RMC is positive but does not significantly influence the extent of information on hedging activities disclosure. However its characteristics (i.e. RMC independence and RMC meeting) have a significant influence. The findings may provide some meaningful insights to regulators, policymakers and researchers, towards the establishment of RMC as a part of the internal corporate governance mechanisms. In addition to its existence, the effectiveness of RMC also needs to be emphasised.",TRUE,FALSE,Derivatives|Disclosure Index|Financial Instruments|Hedging Activities|Risk Management Committee,2018-07-02T11:42:10.380335,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-09T00:03:40.048378,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/citation/,kxfqe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3prwb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/relationships/node/,3prwb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa168a15b1b970013ba8253/,5aa168a15b1b970013ba8253,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxfqe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kxfqe/,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4042764,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kxfqe

An analysis of fiction readership in Russia,"In his now-classical paper, Paul DiMaggio (1987) claimed that popular culture in modern societies “provide(s) stuff of everyday sociability”. It serves to bridge cultural holes between major social groups patronizing different artistic genres. Intuitively appealing and grounded in a long tradition of theorizing on “mass culture”, the proposition that low-brow art serves as the “least cultural denominator”, however, has been scarcely empirically tested. We developed a dual network approach to testing this proposition. We use data on readership in St. Petersburg, Russia, from the city’s municipal public library system (above 1.300.000 records) to reconstruct a network of 22.000 authors. With this, we demonstrate that counter to DiMaggio and others, authors with predominantly university-educated readership are more likely to bridge cultural holes in taste networks, as measured by weighted betweenness and constraint. We interpret this as a sign that, at least as far as the literature is concerned, it is the relatively high-brow, rather than low-brow, artistic figures that are more likely to serve to bridge cultural holes providing themes for “culture talk” (Lizardo) across large social distances. We discuss three explanations for this fact: institutional (the central role of educational institutions in distribution of literature, in contrast to cinema and other predominantly commercial art forms), structural (we claim that the centrality of high-brow tastes is implicated by Peterson’s omnivorousness model) and taste (more educated audiences prefer cultural products transgressing traditional genre boundaries). We argue that the evidence points in the direction of a combination of all three explanations.",TRUE,FALSE,centrality|cultural capital|cultural consumption|omnivorousness|two mode networks,2018-07-02T11:42:10.147242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-08T23:57:30.301551,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nadezhda Sokolova|Mikhail Sokolov (authors),2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/citation/,6xwzm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rkpmv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/relationships/node/,rkpmv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aa15f1df25d10000e39d816/,5aa15f1df25d10000e39d816,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6xwzm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6xwzm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6xwzm

Using nationally representative survey data (N = 2,569) and semi-structured interviews from the National Study of Youth and Religion (N = 30), I test for and explain differences in school grades of five common profiles of religiosity among adolescents in the U.S: Abiders, Adapters, Assenters, Avoiders and Atheists. My quantitative findings suggest that abiders report better grades than avoiders, and the difference is greatest among middle-class families. This pattern holds after controlling for race, religious denomination, sex, mother’s education level, and income. More importantly, the association between religiousness and grades remains after accounting for other factors associated with religiousness, such as increased parental supervision and reduced likelihood of drinking and having sex. My qualitative evidence suggests that this association is a function of greater conscientiousness and agreeableness among abiders. Therefore, I suggest that middle and high schools reward students who are obedient, respectful, and agreeable. Although it is well known that academic performance is associated with income, school grades are also driven by dispositions stemming from religious engagement.

We develop an “evocation model” of the structure and function of frames.

Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace `big data' -- Facebook's advertisement audience estimates -- that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform's over 2 billion users to measure and `nowcast' digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining `online' indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, `offline' indicators related to a country's overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as  online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps.

I argue that movements seek to maximize user activity on social media platforms for increasing on-site mobilization. To examine what factors affect social media activity and how right-wing movements strategically adjust their content, I analyze the German right-wing movement Pegida, which uses Facebook for spreading its anti-Islam agenda and promoting events in the Internet. Data from Pegida’s Facebook page are combined with news reports over a period of 18 months to measure activity on Facebook and in the public sphere simultaneously. Results of quantitative text and time series analysis show that the quantity of posts by Pegida does not increase user activity, but it is the content of posts that matters. Moreover, findings highlight a strong connection between Facebook activities and the public sphere. In times of decreasing public attention, the movement changes its social media strategy in response to exogenous shocks and resorts increasingly to radical mobilization methods.",TRUE,FALSE,automated text analysis|computational social science|Facebook|pegida|Radical Right|Social Media|Social Movements,2018-07-02T11:41:32.081897,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-04T13:40:10.458982,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/citation/,js73z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ebw7m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/relationships/node/,ebw7m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9afea2a9181f000e750e95/,5a9afea2a9181f000e750e95,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js73z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/js73z/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/js73z

It demonstrates that, in the world of diplomacy, entities like 'Kosovo' can act only when they are carefully staged. Thus far, however, the academic discipline of International Relations (IR) has largely failed to acknowledge the role of diplomacy in the constitution of agency. Therefore, to clarify what is at stake in the theoretical debate, I begin with a systematic discussion of how IR has conceived of diplomatic representation. Taking cue from Bruno Latour's and Lisa Disch's writings on political representation, I then suggest an alternative understanding of diplomacy that takes its performative character seriously. Equipped with this conceptual toolkit, I subsequently turn to the story of Kosovo's representation at the Rambouillet conference held in 1999. Tracing how Kosovo Albanians and their international supporters staged Kosovo's diplomatic performance, and how the Yugoslav/Serbian delegation tried to undermine it, I demonstrate that diplomatic representation can indeed generate agency. I also identify three factors that influence whether or not a diplomatic performance succeeds in making those who are represented act: recognition by other international actors, practical competence, and the alignment of the represented.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|diplomacy|Kosovo|performativity|political representation|practice theory,2018-07-02T11:41:31.792272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-03T15:30:53.129931,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d91|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Eastern European Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Tobias Wille,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/citation/,fdhxj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x2u7b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/relationships/node/,x2u7b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9a6ea3f63187000e0ceb2b/,5a9a6ea3f63187000e0ceb2b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fdhxj/,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41268-017-0120-2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fdhxj
