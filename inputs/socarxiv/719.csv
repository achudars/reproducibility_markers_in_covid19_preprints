Using a large, diverse sample of U.S. resident adults, we ask under which conditions do people reveal their political preferences versus keeping them close to the vest. We find Americans are more likely to share their opinions with friends and family rather than co-workers and they are more likely to share their opinions on more salient topics. More importantly, they withhold their political attitudes specifically from those with whom they disagree in an attempt to avoid conflict. This produces the experience of highly homogeneous social contexts, in which only liberal or conservative views are voiced, while dissent remains silent, and oftentimes goes unacknowledged. This experience is not the result of homogeneous social contexts but the appearance of them. Paradoxically, the mechanism of selective disclosure, whose goal is to prevent conflict at the micro-level, might lead to the perception of greater division in the larger society.",TRUE,FALSE,conversations|politics|public opinion|social networks,2018-07-02T10:53:44.058640,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-29T14:20:34.801000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/citation/,uy3k5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bdbuj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/relationships/node/,bdbuj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58dbc1c7b83f6901fc733437/,58dbc1c7b83f6901fc733437,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uy3k5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uy3k5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uy3k5,NA

Maximus labels the latter as participated beings (ὄντα μεθεκτά) and the former as participating beings (ὄντα μετέχοντα), with God transcending both as their cause. The structure of God-as-cause, participated beings, and participating beings matches Proclus’ three-fold structure of participation with the ontological cate- gories of unparticipated, participated, and participating. While Maximus borrows the basic language and structure from Proclus, he makes certain minor but significant differences, particularly in how the participated beings both relate to their source in God and in their status of existence. This article thus sets out to analyze 1.48–50 in the general context of the Centuries of Theology, considering how Maximus conceives of the ontological distinctions between God and God’s works. A comparison with Proclus’ understanding of participation follows, particularly from Proclus’ Elements of Theology, Prop. 23, which succinctly states the three-term distinction of participation. The resulting comparison shows that Proclus’ framework of participation is flattened for Maximus, where the participated works represent multiple properties distinct in kind from the unparticipated, while God fits analogously in the status of the unparticipated. The underlying ontology supports Maximus’ implicit denial that such participated entities represent distinct divinities, as they do for Proclus, while Maximus’ assertion of God’s transcendence is still secured with the ontological distinction between the participated works and their unparticipated cause.

We first describe the technique in detail and show how it can be implemented by individual researchers on an experiment by experiment basis. We then use a simulation to explore its success in identifying true parameter values compared to current statistical norms (ANOVAs and GLMMs). We find that posterior passing allows the true effect in the population to be found with greater accuracy and consistency than the other analysis types considered. Furthermore, posterior passing performs almost identically to a data analysis in which all data from all simulated studies are combined and analysed as one dataset. On this basis, we suggest that posterior passing is a viable means of implementing cumulative science. Furthermore, because it prevents the accumulation of large bodies of conflicting literature, it alleviates the need for traditional meta-analyses. Instead, posterior passing cumulatively and collaboratively provides clarity in real time as each new study is produced and is thus a strong candidate for a new, cumulative approach to scientific analyses and publishing.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian statistics|metascience|psychological methods|replication crisis|stereotype threat,2018-07-02T10:46:27.290813,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-29T12:44:44.205000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Experimental Analysis of Behavior|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/citation/,67jh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jrjd2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/relationships/node/,jrjd2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58dba79e9ad5a101fadc412a/,58dba79e9ad5a101fadc412a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/67jh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/67jh7,NA

This work explains how the mechanisms of poverty regulation interact with local citizenship practices. In effect, the access of the poor to social rights and the exercise of their political rights are both object of a process of regulation by family values ​​in a context of strong social inequalities. Beyond the fact that social assistance depends on family organisation, the implementation of the ‘Bolsa Família’ Programme is based on informal rules, reflecting the dominant social representations of poverty in Brazil. In addition, the allocation of social benefits depends in part on personalised rapports between the programme’s beneficiaries and political candidates and elected representatives. This work is based on a case study in the Northeast region of Brazil—in a middle-sized municipality of the Ceará state. An ethnographic approach allowed the identification of the logic of operation of a political machine involving social assistance, elected officials, social workers and beneficiaries. More generally, this thesis examines the interactions between the poor and the society as a whole, from a local perspective of contemporary issues of poverty regulation and contributes to the study of the political and electoral use of social assistance.",TRUE,FALSE,Bolsa Família|Brazil|CCT|citizenship|clientelism|Northeast Brazil|poverty|social assistance,2018-07-02T10:52:08.830225,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-28T13:24:15.332000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Flávio Eiró,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/citation/,srukg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7pj3y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/relationships/node/,7pj3y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58da60256c613b0047a06c93/,58da60256c613b0047a06c93,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/srukg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/srukg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/srukg,NA

The reasons for this increase are not well understood, nor are what factors might protect people’s access to food. Here we test the hypothesis that an emerging gap between food prices and wages can explain increases in reported inability to afford protein-rich foods and whether welfare regimes can mitigate its impact. We collected data on 21 countries from 2004-2012 on food prices and deprivation related to food, denoted by reported in ability to afford to eat meat, chicken, fish or a vegetarian equivalent, every second day, from EuroStat 2015 edition and on wages from the OECD 2015 edition. After adjusting for macroeconomic factors, we found that each 1% rise in the price of food over and above wages was associated with greater self-reported food deprivation (β = 0.063, 95% CI: 0.033 to 0.092); particularly among impoverished groups. But, this association also varied across welfare regimes. In Eastern European welfare regimes, a 1% rise in the price of food over wages was associated with a 0.081 percentage point rise in food deprivation (95% CI: 0.051 to 0.11) while in Social Democratic welfare regimes we find no clear association (p = 0.37). Rising prices of food coupled with stagnating wages are a major factor driving food deprivation, especially in deprived groups; however, our evidence indicates that more generous welfare systems can mitigate this impact.",TRUE,FALSE,food|food insecurity|welfare regimes,2018-07-02T10:49:08.486486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-28T11:06:29.971000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/citation/,fvyx7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k6zyj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/relationships/node/,k6zyj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58da4309594d90004aaf353f/,58da4309594d90004aaf353f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvyx7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fvyx7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fvyx7,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980017000167

To date, however, less effort has been aimed at uniting these lines of inquiry.  In particular, do friendship bonds emerge, based in part, on shared levels of cognitive ability?  Several disparate lines of evidence suggest this might be the case, however, a need remains to replicate this work using large national samples coupled with psychometrically sound measurement.  The current study helps to fill this void in the literature using a national sample of American children.  Our results reveal that preadolescent friendship dyads are robustly correlated on measures of general intelligence, and the effects withstand correction for potentially confounding variables.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:55:04.581015,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-27T16:59:04.871000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology,Brian Boutwell,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/citation/,yv8yd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pe5hb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/relationships/node/,pe5hb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d94105594d900045af3481/,58d94105594d900045af3481,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv8yd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yv8yd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yv8yd,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2017.07.002
