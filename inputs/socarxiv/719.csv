Despite a recent turn towards the study of political violence within the field of contentious politics, scholars have yet to focus their lens on genocide. This is puzzling, as the field of collective action and social movements was originally developed in reaction to fascism (Nazism in particular), while research on collective action and research on genocide has long shown parallel findings and shared insights. This paper reviews the history of this scholarly convergence and divergence, and suggests that recent findings of research on genocide can be improved by the consideration of concepts from social movements and collective action. It then details three theories of the micro-mechanisms that mobilize individuals for contention – framing, diffusion, and networks – and specifies how they refine existing explanations of civilian participation in genocide. In the conclusion, I suggest that a contentious politics approach to genocide would consider it one form of collective action among others, analyzable within the existing framework of collective action and social movement theory.",TRUE,FALSE,collective action|contentious politics|genocide|political violence|preprint|socarxiv|social movements,2018-07-02T10:46:25.419420,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-20T03:04:54.955000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/citation/,5p64y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m9ck9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/relationships/node/,m9ck9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578eea58b83f6901f2dad1da/,578eea58b83f6901f2dad1da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p64y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5p64y/,https://doi.org/10.1111/soc4.12304,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5p64y

developed through a synthesis of new social movement theory and Frickel

to the SIMs model, this paper argues that many new disciplines emerge 
through contentious collective action on the part of political and 
intellectual outsiders rather than through the action of intellectual 
elites. The framework is demonstrated and tested through a narrative 
exploration based on secondary sources and scholar-activist tests of the 
emergence of two disciplines, women’s studies and Asian American

This article is about behavioral variation in genocide. Research frequently suggests that violent behaviors can be explained by or treated as synonymous with ethnic categories. This literature also tends to pre-group actors as perpetrators, victims, or bystanders for research purposes. However, evidence that individuals cross boundaries from killing to desistance and saving throughout genocide indicates that the relationship between behaviors and categories is often in flux. I thus introduce the concept of behavioral boundary crossing to examine when and how Hutu in 1994 Rwanda aligned with the killing behaviors expected of them and when and how they did not. I analyze interviews with 31 Hutu, revealing that transactional, relational, social-psychological, and cognitive mechanisms informed individuals’ behaviors during the genocide. The result is a dynamic theory of action that explains participation without homogenizing individual experience due to presumptions about behavioral and categorical alignment.",TRUE,FALSE,action|behavior|boundaries|genocide|political violence|preprint|rwanda|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:47.477818,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-20T02:23:54.226000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/citation/,pe578,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dmb7k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/relationships/node/,dmb7k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578ee0bb6c613b01eba2ec24/,578ee0bb6c613b01eba2ec24,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe578/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pe578/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0735275115587721,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pe578

On the one hand, decentralisation and autonomy may allow ethnic minorities to directly control their own affairs or to better hold regional rulers to account. On the other hand, decentralisation and autonomy in multi-ethnic countries may foster centrifugal forces and bestow legitimacy and resources to secessionist groups. Current evidence from cross-country or cross-ethnic group econometric studies are limited by crude operationalisation of decentralisation and often questionable treatment of endogeneity.


The paper makes three key contributions: i) it builds a new dataset bringing together up-to-date and cutting edge data on decentralisation and autonomy (RAI) and ethnic group violence (EPR), thereby providing new insights on groups exposure to decentralisation in 81 countries between 1945 and 2010; ii) it tests how various facets of decentralisation (autonomy, self-rule, shared-rule, political decentralisation) relate to ethnic violence; and iii) it exploits dynamic panel data techniques, namely the difference-GMM estimator, to account for reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity biases. The validity and strength of the estimator are explicitly established.


I find that regional autonomy - even when decentralisation is otherwise limited - strongly reduces the incidence of ethnic civil wars. The conflict-mitigating effect of autonomy is maximal when regional governments command substantial powers in terms of policy-setting and when political decentralisation is strong. Political decentralisation is also found to be a strong and consistent factor of ethnic peace in the absence of regional autonomy. In contrast, granting regional governments wide-ranging authorities on policy and fiscal matters does not reduce the incidence of large-scale ethnic conflict on its own. Granting autonomy to regional governments which have no substantial powers of self-rule is weakly correlated with higher chances of onset of civil wars but a combination of autonomy and above-median self-rule and political decentralisation strongly reduces such a likelihood. Regional autonomy appears to be the only effective strategy to stop existing civil wars.

It is no accident that biotechnology patent cases repeatedly coalesce around such process-related issues; rather, in biotechnology patenting a discontinuity at the center of patent law has finally come to light.

However, this archaic claim is a poor fit to the context of cyberspace, and courts have had to substantially revise the elements of the claim to accommodate it to computer networks. In doing so, they have created a new species of property right which is now being applied to a wide variety of automated computer interactions.

Analysts doing cluster analysis sometimes want the data to tell them the optimum number of clusters. Common ""stopping rules"" use the Calinski-Harabasz pseudo-F statistic and Duda-Hart indices, which are based on squared Euclidean distances between cases. Cluster analysis operates on a pairwise matrix of distances between the objects clusters, which are usually created from the observed variables. However, approaches such as expert judgement or algorithmic pattern-recognition (as used for instance in sequence analysis) often output matrices of pairwise similarity or difference whose relationship to the observed variables is much less direct. Built-in Stata utilities allow calculation of the CH and DH indices when cluster analysis starts from variables, but not with cluster analysis that starts from a pairwise distance matrix (unless the distances are squared Euclidean distances defined on variables which are still available). In this note I present two small Stata utilities that will calculate the CH and DH statistics from the distance matrix, if the distances are squared Euclidean. If the distances have another metric, these utilities can be seen as calculating a pseudo-CH pseudo-F or pseudo-DH statistic, potentially extending their use to new applications.
