Such scripts are amplified by a context in which a version of Islamic family law that envisions women as primarily domestic and men as household authorities and breadwinners has been institutionalized. However, this vision is also being challenged by women’s increasing educational attainment as well as competing egalitarian discourses of gender in Islam. The gendered religious scripts used by Muslim couples compensate for social changes that threaten to reshape both domestic and public life. I propose that how Muslim men and women talk about their marriages and households has become a key mechanism for accomplishing modern Muslim gender identities in a context where men’s authority is at risk.

A vibrant and diverse Indonesian women’s movement arose in the 1990s and played an important role in the democracy movement. Since then, women’s rights activists have achieved some crucial reforms, but have also confronted unprecedented and complex challenges—notably, the rise of religious conservatism. This chapter examines how the Indonesian women’s rights movement has fared with the advent of democratization. While democratization in Indonesia has produced important gains for women’s rights, it has also empowered conservative activists who oppose much of the agenda of the women’s rights movement. Women’s rights activists have had difficulty responding to this challenge because of ideological divisions and lack of a mass base, and because the state has been increasingly willing to defer to conservative forces. In short, the key factors for the fate of women’s rights activism during Indonesia’s democratization have been the patterns of women’s mobilization, the strength of counter-movement mobilization, and political decentralization—all of which have been shaped by pre-transition political legacies. The experience of activists in Indonesia suggests that the recent literature on democratization and women’s rights would benefit from greater consideration of how and when democratization processes can empower illiberal actors, counter-movements, and/or backlash against women’s rights.",TRUE,FALSE,Democratization|Feminism|Gender|Indonesia|Islam|Muslim|Women|Women's Rights,2019-05-23T21:10:21.448177,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23T21:10:03.830002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Rachel Rinaldo,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/citation/,cfyva,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce709b035f2580017a88ade/,5ce709b035f2580017a88ade,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfyva/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfyva,NA

This is, in short, the focal question of this article. Current media discourses of ""Big Data"" are characterized by a high degree of metaphorization and these metaphors play a key role in how we (mis)understand this ill-defined phenomenon. For example, media scholars Cornelius Puschman and Jean Burgess argue that associated metaphors of big data as a force of nature to be controlled and a form of nourishment/fuel to be consumed lead to a deceptive understanding of big data in terms of natural phenomena. These metaphors are misleading, they argue, as by evoking the image of big data as a force of nature their value is presented as a naturally given, while the fact that value and meaning are actually inscribed by analysis is obscured. This article aims to further deconstruct the representational politics of big data metaphors, directing specific attention to changes in the discursive—specifically metaphorical—framing of data practices in the 1990s, comparing academic discourses with corporate media discourses.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-23T20:56:41.870909,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23T20:56:31.308890,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/citation/,z2ejm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce6594135f2580018a6eb27/,5ce6594135f2580018a6eb27,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z2ejm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z2ejm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z2ejm,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.037

Today I want to focus on the most important question of all: are we building the world we all want?"" Zuckerberg goes on to propose how Facebook can shape an equitable future, explaining how, ""In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us."" This is a radically optimistic and persuasive agenda, and if one were to focus solely on the efforts of community building, then one might not be compelled to consider how, in fact, Facebook will achieve its future vision. Omitted from this sanguine future narrative is any mention whatsoever of data as its key asset. The basic work Facebook does is to collect data and to hold on to it for a long time, if not forever. Thus, the future conjured for us by Facebook necessitates the production of data by its participants, though not once is data referenced.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-23T20:55:08.792774,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23T20:54:44.809404,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/citation/,3kfs5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce650fb2a50c400177ea437/,5ce650fb2a50c400177ea437,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3kfs5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kfs5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3kfs5,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.038

Since 2006, the counties in Norway have been financing OER, thus ensuring access to high-quality educational materials. In 13 interviews, opportunities and challenges are analysed from the perspective of the experts. Quality assurance, professionalization processes, user-oriented design as well as licensing issues and the development of a new platform are also discussed.
