Recent studies have advanced the political backlash model by emphasizing the process at lower levels, measuring broad political disagreement within congregations and subsequent disaffiliation among religionists. I argue that while studying political disagreement at the congregational level is a step in the right direction, the role of conflict on specific, salient issues has been underemphasized. Using data from the Baylor Religion Survey, I exploit a unique set of items to analyze what I call “conflicted religionists”—religionists who experience attitudinal conflict with their churches—and I measure conflict on two salient issues: same-sex marriage and abortion. I find that there is a considerable proportion of conflicted religionists on both issues and that the probability of experiencing conflict varies drastically across different groups in the sample. I further demonstrate that experiencing conflict is significantly associated with lower church attendance. I conclude with a discussion of the importance of salient issues for our understanding of political backlash and future disaffiliation.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitude Conflict|Conflicted Religionists|Political Backlash|Politics and Religion|U.S. Religious Change,2019-10-28T19:21:42.480457,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-28T19:21:16.019685,NA,NA,available,NA,https://www.baylor.edu/baylorreligionsurvey/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/citation/,sk857,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vw3f9/,vw3f9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db71ea1cfc96c000ebfb07e/,5db71ea1cfc96c000ebfb07e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sk857/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sk857/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sk857,NA

We find evidence that human raters have significant non-uniform preferences over these nonsense words, and we detail the consequences of this finding for social science work that utilizes identifiers without accounting for this effect.

Yet conservationists increasingly recognise the importance of implementing demand-side interventions that target the end consumers in the trade chain. Their aim is to curb the consumption of wildlife or shift consumption to more sustainable alternatives. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps in our understanding of the diversity of consumer motivations in the context of illegal wildlife trade, which includes hundreds of thousands of species, different uses, and diverse contexts. We developed a typology of common motivations held by wildlife consumers that can be used to inform conservation interventions, based upon consultation with multiple experts from a diversity of backgrounds, nationalities, and focal taxa. We identified five main motivational categories for wildlife use: experiential, social, functional, financial, and spiritual, each containing sub-categories. This framework is intended to facilitate more nuanced approaches to demand reduction, such as the tailoring of interventions—whether behaviour change campaigns, enforcement efforts, or incentive programmes—to the specific context in which they will be used.

According to current interpretations, the indicators used – mainly generic average duration, specific average duration, the frequency of participation – provide information on the behavior of the individuals in the analyzed sample and, ultimately, the reference population. Here a different interpretation is proposed, based on the fact that the indicators refer instead to a sample of events of participation in activities rather than to the individuals that those events produce. In other words, we try to show that the usual interpretations of these indicators are mostly incorrect.",TRUE,FALSE,events|indicators of participation|individuals|time use survey,2019-10-26T19:13:41.661932,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-26T19:13:17.322954,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/citation/,3y2d4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db3038b743c23000ca03c53/,5db3038b743c23000ca03c53,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y2d4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3y2d4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3y2d4,NA

Experimental evidence on the efficacy of childcare subsidies in raising parental labor supply","As a policy tool aimed at raising parental labor supply, childcare subsidies come with high expectations. Using data from a factorial survey, we examine whether childcare subsidies reach their goal. Because of the simultaneity of the decision to take up a job and arranging childcare, we experimentally alter hypothetical income (e.g., gross earnings from a job, income from other sources) as well as aspects of the childcare setting including subsidy levels. Using an alternative specific conditional logit model, we show that subsidies have the expected effect of increasing parents’ labor supply. Moreover, the results from simulations based on the estimated utility function show that varying subsidy levels have different effects on subgroups of parents. Subsidies are especially efficient in raising the labor supply of high income, Swiss-born parents, and especially for women. We also find that subsidies already have the desired effect at 25% of total childcare costs and that the marginal utility of higher subsidy levels decreases quite sharply beyond that threshold. Subsidies covering 25% of the total costs for childcare lead to an approximately 3 hours per week increase in the labor supply of women.",TRUE,FALSE,childcare subsidies|economics of the household|factorial survey experiment|family policy|labor supply,2019-10-26T19:02:43.815727,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-26T19:02:24.357830,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/citation/,sbp48,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db2f43946b571000c07c428/,5db2f43946b571000c07c428,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbp48/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbp48/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sbp48,NA
