Competing explanations downplay the negative consequences of “creative destruction” and focus instead on unhealthy lifestyles. This article contributes to this debate by presenting the first empirical analysis of the role of deindustrialization in the deaths of despair epidemic that hit Eastern Europe in the 1990s. Drawing on the thematic analysis of 82 semi-structured interviews in four deindustrialized towns in Hungary, the article constructs a general sociological framework for analyzing deaths of despair applicable to other rustbelt areas. Deindustrialization engenders individual and social processes that affect health by increasing stress and eroding coping resources. By conceptualizing deindustrialization as a fundamental cause of ill health, sociology has great potential to contribute to understanding the root causes of deaths of despair.",TRUE,FALSE,deaths of despair|deindustrialization|fundamental cause|health inequality|psychosocial stress,2020-12-20T02:49:41.582739,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-20T02:49:14.328093,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/citation/,m5r78,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fddb2b8149e75058102a807/,5fddb2b8149e75058102a807,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5r78/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m5r78/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m5r78

Focusing on twenty-one European countries, this paper establishes that countries differ in the strength of the pathways that connect educational credentials to the occupational structure, though there is considerable variability in the country rankings of the strength of individual pathways. Pathway strength matters for the quality of occupational matching, for employment and earnings, and for the earnings gap between well matched and less well-matched workers. In general, the total effects of local linkage strength are to raise earnings and to lower unemployment risk, though positive total effects of local linkage on earnings are concentrated at the lower tertiary and non-tertiary educational levels. Suggestive evidence that pathway effects are stronger in high-linkage countries exists for male and for older female workers, and the results also support the hypothesis that local linkage is more protective against unemployment in high linkage countries. However, consistent differences between high-linkage and low-linkage countries within educational levels are elusive. Thus, while macro-structural effects may be important, the principal difference among countries appears to be in the extent and distribution of pathway strength leading from educational credentials to occupations.",TRUE,FALSE,educational attainment|labor markets|occupational attainment|occupational segregation|pathways|school to work transitions|skill formation,2020-12-20T02:51:00.934935,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-20T02:50:49.722441,FALSE,NA,no,Access to these data requires a license agreement with Eurostat,,available,NA,https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/european-union-labour-force-survey,prereg_designs,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/citation/,7k4nw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdd6948149e75057102fd4c/,5fdd6948149e75057102fd4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7k4nw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7k4nw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7k4nw

We use unique data gathered during the peak of the UK lockdown (May-June), when many employees were required to work from home, to see whether fathers flexible working was associated with a more equitable division of housework and childcare. We found mothers were more likely to be the ones carrying out more if not all of five of the six categories of housework and care we examined – namely, cooking, cleaning, routine and non-routine childcare, and the education of children/home-schooling, both before and during the lockdown. This was not the case for the DIY tasks. A multivariate regression analysis showed that when fathers worked from home or using flexitime during the lockdown, a more equal division was found for tasks such as cleaning, routine childcare, and to some extent home schooling. Furthermore, fathers who worked flexibly were more likely to report that they had increased the amount of time they spent on housework and care. Mothers also reported that fathers who worked from home increased the time they spent on routine childcare. Overall, the study shows how flexible working, including working from home among men, especially done on a mass scale where there are no negative assumptions or stigma behind its use, may lead to a more equitable distribution of housework and childcare.

This paper examines the current polls leading up to the 2020 election and the impact that defining education may be having on predicting outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,College-Educated Voter|Election Polling|Polling Variables|Presidential Election|Voting,2020-12-20T02:48:42.125824,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-20T02:48:17.396363,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/citation/,xwqps,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdcd8e2f0df5405692f5a84/,5fdcd8e2f0df5405692f5a84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwqps/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xwqps/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xwqps

Yet, less is known about how contact to these three systems evolves as children age, and how children’s trajectories through these institutions should be conceptualized. In this article, we use administrative data on the full population of Danish children born 1982-1995 that had contact to at least one of three systems before turning 21. Theoretically, we argue that children’s trajectories of institutional contacts can be understood as a moral career as suggested by Goffman (1959). Empirically, we study how children move between and are retained within the three systems across childhood. We find that early contact originates with child protective services but branch out through both overlap and transitions to the other systems. Further, across age there is high levels of retention within the systems, and clear gendered dynamics play out as children age. We argue that children’s trajectories across age can be viewed as moving from a position as a subject at risk to a position as subject of risk.",TRUE,FALSE,childhood|child protective services|criminal justice|institutional contact|mental health,2020-12-18T21:40:02.382398,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-18T21:39:40.890569,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/citation/,mybs5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j8zqw/,j8zqw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdcd69d149e750540029188/,5fdcd69d149e750540029188,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mybs5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mybs5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mybs5

Using Stats19 police data 2012-2019, we find a three-fold decline in number of injuries inside low traffic neighbourhoods after implementation, relative to the rest of Waltham Forest and the rest of Outer London.  We further estimate that walking, cycling, and driving all became approximately 3-4 times safer per trip. There was no evidence that injury numbers changed on boundary roads. Our findings suggest that low traffic neighbourhoods reduce injury risks across all modes inside the neighbourhood, without negative impacts at the boundary.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-18T21:38:01.938456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-18T21:37:37.357529,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data,no,"We used a research design similar to our other research looking at impacts of LTNs, using spatial administrative data.",,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/citation/,46p3w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z29uf/,z29uf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdcbcd20694b7059df38b29/,5fdcbcd20694b7059df38b29,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/46p3w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/46p3w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/46p3w

As they increasingly drive bank lending, TLTROs often enable unsustainable investments. This report proposes Green TLTROs, which are refinancing operations that provide banks with cheap funding if they lend in accordance with the EU’s taxonomy of green activities. We discuss the legality of such a market-based programme and show that it is compatible with a level playing field between banks and the singleness of monetary policy. We outline several possible technical designs of the Green TLTROs and suggest a pilot programme for energy efficient housing that can quickly be implemented.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-18T21:29:41.181124,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-18T21:29:10.007699,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies,Positive Money Europe and Sustainable Finance Lab,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/citation/,2bx8h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdca91a0694b70596f37fef/,5fdca91a0694b70596f37fef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bx8h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2bx8h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2bx8h
