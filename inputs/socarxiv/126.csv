An efficient municipal solid waste collection and disposal is closely related to both lower waste tax and higher welfare of the interested population. In Italy, the lack of a centralized regulatory framework has determined heterogeneous performances of sector operators across the country. Firstly, we will be estimating the productive efficiency in different optimal territorial areas and secondly we will be forecasting the economic benefits that would arise under a new regulatory regime. Our approach combines the well-known yardstick competition and the price-cap mechanisms. Results suggest that if all territorial areas converged to the most efficient ones, a potential saving between 12% and 19% emerges, i.e., up to €2bn savings out of €10.05bn total tax revenue in 2015.",TRUE,FALSE,environmental policy|green economy|price cap|price-cap|regulation|waste fee|waste management|waste tax,2020-08-26T20:32:30.283373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-26T20:32:02.863317,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/citation/,h5mgk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4529bfbacde8026a33da66/,5f4529bfbacde8026a33da66,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5mgk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h5mgk/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.07.040,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h5mgk

Empirically, left-right self-placements are often not normally distributed but have multiple peaks (e.g. extreme-left-center-right-extreme). Some stylized facts are extracted from histograms from the European Social Survey. In the bounded confidence model, agents repeatedly adjust their ideological position in their ideological neighborhood. As an extension of the classical model, agents sometimes completely reassesses their opinion depending on their ideological openness and their propensity for reassessment, respectively. Simulations show that this leads to the emergence of clustered ideological landscapes similar to the ones observed empirically. However, not all stylized facts of real world ideological landscapes can be reproduced with the model. 

Changes in the model parameters show that the ideological landscapes are susceptible to interesting slow and abrupt changes.
A long term goal is to integrate models of opinion dynamics into the classical spatial model of electoral competition as a dynamic element taking into account that voters themselves shape the political landscape by adjusting their positions and preferences through interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-25T13:33:01.745307,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-25T13:32:54.226136,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,© Springer International Publishing AG,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/citation/,3qkcr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/us573/,us573,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f44f2df746a8102431a734a/,5f44f2df746a8102431a734a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qkcr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3qkcr/,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-47253-9_22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3qkcr

Recent findings from Sweden however suggested that the association of CCTV with crime may be different in deprived neighborhoods in Sweden where criminal networks exert a large influence. In addition, much less research has been done on the impact of CCTV on crime clearance. 
The present study follows up on this by considering changes in crime, and crime clearance, associated with CCTV in three deprived neighborhoods in Gothenburg. The three neighborhoods had CCTV installed around their main squares/centers in 2018, and changes in recorded crime for seven crime types taking place in public – as well as the share of those crimes where a suspect has been identified is followed. The changes are compared with changes at similar locations in the other six deprived neighborhoods of Gothenburg. 
The results show that relative to controls, violence was significantly reduced at treatment areas. No significant change was noted for property crime. Crime clearance rates increased at treatment areas relative to controls for both property crimes and violent crimes, but no change was significant. This suggests a need for further study on contextual differences of different locations for CCTV, to ascertain whether the effect on violence in deprived neighborhoods can be replicated. It also raises questions on whether the CCTV is cost-effective, since it appears to have small effects on both crime and crime clearance.",TRUE,FALSE,CCTV|crime clearance|crime prevention|police|violence|vulnerable neighborhoods,2020-08-25T13:32:27.996985,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-25T13:31:56.648857,TRUE,Gerell has a part time employment with the national operations division of the police.,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/citation/,s94pm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f44ca8abacde8024533e77e/,5f44ca8abacde8024533e77e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s94pm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s94pm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s94pm

Why? I argue that military cooperation with liberal democracies constrains the state from using severe forms of repression against opposition campaigns. Liberal democracies face costs for human rights violations by their friends, and are likely to coerce the military from repressive actions. Such interconnectedness also socializes the military with democratic militaries that have strong norms against the use of widespread and excessive repression. However, the military is not the only repressing agency, and therefore this constraint does not act to prevent repression but rather to limit its severity. This theory is tested using the NAVCO data and a new, latent measure of military cooperation. I find that military cooperation with liberal democracies does not prevent the state from repressing opposition movements, but it does limit the severity.

Specifically, τb is not a measure of similarity; it is a measure of concordance or rank-order similarity. Although S is a measure of similarity, it does not account for the degree of third-party relationships, only the symmetry of such relationships. A new algorithm, D, which incorporates the degree of mutual relationships into the measurement of foreign policy similarity, is introduced. The resulting D − score is standardized, as opposed to the S − score which has four commonly used versions in addition to several others that may be subjectively defined. Second, the input data for measures of foreign policy similarity are typically data on formal alliances. Generally speaking, alliances are a granular indicator of an underlying, military-strategic relationship between states, more generally referred to as military cooperation. As such, the policy portfolio used to calculate D can include additional indicators of military cooperation. Alliances, joint military exercises (for which new data has been collected), arms transfers, and multinational combat and peacekeeping operations are combined using a graded response model to estimate military cooperation as a latent trait. The latent trait is used as input data to calculate the D − score, which is directly compared with the S − score and shown to be consistent with intuitive notions of policy similarity while the S-score is not. In a replication study, the new measure is shown to not be substitutable with the S-score.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-25T05:22:45.148033,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-25T05:22:15.391494,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon request.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/citation/,fuet4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f43d5fc746a8101e81ac6f1/,5f43d5fc746a8101e81ac6f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fuet4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fuet4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fuet4

Using a systematic search strategy, we examined 56 out of 15,592 papers which detailed types of sexual relationship and associated sexual partners. We found most studies were published within the C21st, with the majority conducted within the USA. Studies used a range of primarily quantitative designs. We examined the number of partnerships noted in included papers; to appraise existing work regarding any partner typologies. We found that studies tended to have a close focus on one kind of relationship/partner (e.g., ‘casual’) rather than explore a large range of diverse partnership types. Subsequently we synthesised the types of relationship/partner detailed within the literature by extracting and interpreting the commonalities and differences among reported partnership types. In this way, we were able to develop a spectrum of eight categories of relationships. These categories were; 1) ‘married/committed’; 2) ‘main partner’/’serious partner’/’stable’ or ‘Long term’; 3) ‘steady’; 4) ‘girlfriend’/’boyfriend’; 5) ‘dating’/’going out’; 6) ‘friends with benefits’; 7) ‘fuck buddies’ and ‘booty calls’; and finally: 8) ‘super casual’, ‘hook-ups’, ‘meets and one night stands’. It is hoped that these synthesised categories will be useful for those wishing to target and tailor sexual health interventions by relationship/partner type, or enhance further theoretical research into romantic and sexual relationships.",TRUE,FALSE,Intimate relationships|Partner type|Partner typologies|Relationship categories|Sex partner|Sexual health|Sexual partnerships|Sexual relationships,2020-08-25T05:25:00.932699,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-25T05:24:48.216093,FALSE,NA,no,Reviewed published literature listed in databases,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/citation/,fvmqw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f43d537f5791501a7ea7aec/,5f43d537f5791501a7ea7aec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvmqw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fvmqw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fvmqw

Participants: 1,806 students attending a racially diverse 4-year university with a high rate of first generation college students.
Methods: An online survey utilizing measures of depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), faculty and academic advising support, economic insecurity, studying conditions, family conditions, trouble concentrating on schoolwork, and academic performance. OLS regression is used to explain academic performance and trouble concentrating.  
Results: Four of five students reported trouble concentrating, and trouble concentrating strongly decreased academic performance. Faculty and peer advising support and adequate studying conditions improved academic performance. Depression strongly increased trouble concentrating. Adequate studying conditions and academic advising support improved concentration.
Conclusions: In the upcoming year, faculty and student support services should highlight mental health issues and services, and increase supports for students experiencing distress.",TRUE,FALSE,academic performance|Covid-19|depression|stressors|trouble concentrating,2020-08-25T05:21:41.852842,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-25T05:21:28.113717,FALSE,NA,no,Based on original data restricted to use by the co-investigators by ou IRB to protect confidentiality.
