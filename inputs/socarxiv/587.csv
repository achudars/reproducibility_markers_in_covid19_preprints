It allows for collateral arrangements adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out the market price of a collateralized contract. This framework is very useful for valuing outstanding derivatives. Using a unique dataset, we find empirical evidence that credit risk alone is not overly important in determining credit-related spreads. Only accounting for both collateral posting and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of derivatives. We also empirically gauge the impact of collateral agreements on risk measurements. Our findings indicate that there are important interactions between market and credit risk.

Methods: Systematic analysis of media reports of anti-deportation protests. We manually coded 6419 article about 986 protest events. Results: The frequency of anti-deportation protest has increased in Austria and Germany, but not so in Switzerland. Many different kinds of actors are involved in anti-deportation protests, and most commonly these are actors who protest on behalf of those threatened with deportation. These actors come from across the political spectrum, and protest is predominantly local in nature. In the three countries, repertoires of protest vary, but demonstrations are the most common form. In 59% of cases, the focus is on policy reform, and in 41% of cases the focus is on a specific deportation.

This paper explores how organisations can cope with high employee turnover. This paper aims to highlight potential benefits of maintaining a network of employee alumni and rehiring former employees. Finally, this paper also introduces the concept of recoverability to define the potential of employee alumni to be rehired.

Approach:
This paper reviewed the latest literature on employee alumni and rehiring. This paper does not discuss the potential antecedents of employee turnover, instead focuses on a coping mechanism for the consequence. 

Findings:
This paper challenges the assumption that former employees can no longer contribute to the organisation after their resignation. Additionally, this paper disputes the premise of employee turnover finality by exploring employee rehiring as a potential solution to recoup lost human capital. Finally, this paper identifies an apparent lack of human resources management literature on employee rehiring. 

Research Implication:
This paper discusses scientific and practical implications and future research directions on employee alumni and rehiring. 

Originality:

As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart’ urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey’s growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey’s multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city’s hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to ~9,000 and ~124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 minutes by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as ~8,000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city’s schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 minutes by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and ‘smart’ urban investment strategies.",TRUE,FALSE,equity|open-source data|smart cities|transportation,2018-07-02T11:53:44.568059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T14:49:15.010204,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Mayaud|J.

Strategic Action, Temporality, and the Expansion of US Higher Education","The massive expansion of US higher education after World War II is a sociological puzzle: a spectacular feat of state capacity-building in a highly federated polity. Prior scholarship names academic leaders as key drivers of this expansion, yet the conditions for the possibility and fate of their activity remain under-specified. We fill this gap by theorizing what Randall Collins first called educational entrepreneurship as a special kind of strategic action in the US polity. We argue that the cultural authority and organizational centrality of universities in the US national context combine with historical contingency to episodically produce conditions under which academic credentials can be made viable solutions to social problems. We put our theorization to the test by revisiting and extending a paradigmatic case: the expansion of engineering education at Stanford University between 1945 and 1969. Invoking several contemporaneous and subsequent cases, we demonstrate the promise of theorizing educational expansion as an outcome of strategic action by specifically located actors over time.",TRUE,FALSE,credentialism|entrepreneurship|field theory|higher education|historical sociology|organizational theory|political sociology|science policy|strategic action,2018-07-02T11:53:44.485001,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-30T20:18:51.175487,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf029000zm/,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/citation/,pd8c4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0efa0964f25a000d72bef7/,5b0efa0964f25a000d72bef7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pd8c4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pd8c4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pd8c4

This paper tries to move beyond this limitation and discusses data-based value creation in data-intensive infrastructures, such as social media, by focusing on processes of data generation, use and reuse, and on infrastructure development activities. Building on current debates in value theory, the paper develops a multidimensional value framework to interrogate the data collected in an embedded ethnographical case study of the development of PatientsLikeMe, a social media network for patients. It asks when, and where, value is created from the data, and what kinds of value are created from them, as they move through the data infrastructure; and how infrastructure evolution relates to, and shapes, existing data-based value creation practices. The findings show that infrastructure development can have unpredictable consequences for data-based value creation, shaping shared practices in complex ways and through a web of interdependent situations. The paper argues for an understanding of infrastructural innovation that accounts for the situational interdependencies of data use and reuse. Uniquely positioned, the paper demonstrates the importance of research that looks critically into processes of data use in infrastructures to keep abreast of the social consequences of developments in big data and data analytics aimed at exploiting all kinds of digital traces for multiple purposes.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|crowdsourcing|data-intensive infrastructures|data reuse|information infrastructures|infrastructural innovation|infrastructure development|social media|value|value creation,2018-07-02T11:53:43.999978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-30T15:05:05.381154,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/citation/,msvqh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n78jp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/relationships/node/,n78jp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0eaac172e399000fb2bba8/,5b0eaac172e399000fb2bba8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msvqh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/msvqh/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infoandorg.2017.08.001,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/msvqh

New analyses of the dynamic effects of own and reference income on life satisfaction,"Do people adapt to changes in income? In contradiction to much of the previous literature, I find no evidence of adaptation to income in GSOEP (1984-2015) and UKHLS (1996-2017) data. Furthermore, I find that people also do not adapt to changes in reference income. Instead, reference income effects may be subject to reinforcement over time. Following the empirical approach of Vendrik (2013), I obtain these findings by estimating life satisfaction equations in which contemporaneous and lagged terms for a respondent’s own household income and their estimated reference income are simultaneously entered. Additionally, I instrument for own income and include lags of a large set of controls. What was found to be adaptation to raw household income in previous studies turns out to
have been driven by reinforcement of an initially small negative effect of household size that grows large over time. Implications of this result for the estimation of equivalence scales with subjective data are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|BHPS|equivalence scale|GSOEP|income comparison|life satisfaction|SOEP|subjective well-being|SWB|UKHLS|Understanding Society,2018-07-02T11:53:43.928146,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-30T15:03:50.822143,NA,NA,no,The Understanding Society/BHPS data is available from: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation.
