Especially little is known about how only-children fare in different societies. Using data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 on 15-year old students from 31 countries, we examine how family socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive and noncognitive outcomes of only-children vary across countries. In particular, we analyze the importance of the country-level family size composition to explain cross-national differences in only-children's status and performance. Our analysis reveals four patterns: First, we found a substantial variation in the proportion of only-children across countries. Second, only-children in countries where small families are more prevalent are more likely to come from high-SES families than are those in countries where small families are less prevalent. Third, where the proportion of small families is higher, only-children fare consistently better across performance outcomes than do those in countries where the proportion is lower. With regard to cognitive outcomes, such cross-national patterns are largely explained by the cross-national variation in only-children’s prestige in family SES. Lastly, we also find important associations between the relative outcomes of only-children and policies, such as educational policies and the school tracking system.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive and noncognitive performance|cross-nation approach|family size|family socioeconomic status|only-child|PISA|siblings,2018-07-02T11:10:50.417680,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-07T09:15:37.934243,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",Seongsoo Choi,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/citation/,kc6x5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3gw9a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/relationships/node/,3gw9a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59b10bc99ad5a1025487b1e8/,59b10bc99ad5a1025487b1e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kc6x5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kc6x5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kc6x5,NA

Traditionally, such information has been collected from a single informant. More recently, research has suggested that a multiple in-
formant approach to collecting FHH results in improved individual risk assessments. Likewise, recent work has emphasized the importance of incorporating health-related
behaviors into FHH based risk calculations. Integrating both multiple accounts of FHH
with behavioral information on family members represents a significant methodological challenge as such FHH data is hierarchical in nature and arises from potentially error-prone processes. In this paper, we introduce a statistical model that addresses that challenges using informative priors for background variation in disease prevalence
and the effect of other, potentially correlated, variables jointly with handling the hierarchical structure nesting multiple FHH accounts into families. Our empirical example
is drawn from previously published data on families with a history of diabetes. The results of the model assessment suggest that simply accounting for the structured na-
ture of multiple informant FHH data improves classification accuracy over the baseline

In short, no.
The U.S. Tax Court will not apply the OECD BEPS Action 9 Recommendation regarding risk allocation for three reasons. (1) Two Constitutional reasons: (a) the Constitutional cavalcade of hierarchy regarding international law in the United States—much less the precedential value of a secondary source, such as OECD reports. (b) The concept of stare decisis that is embedded in the common law system of the Anglo-American tradition relies on cases being decided as they have been decided in the past. The tradition of upholding prior precedent is not easily broken—except for egregious reasons, such as regarding slavery. 
(2) Given the status of international law and international secondary sources in the United States in addition to the concept of stare decisis, the U.S. Tax Court—as all courts in the United States—consistently build on judicial application of law. Four key transfer pricing cases since the 1986 transfer pricing tax reforms in the United States will be shown to support the concept of stare decisis.
(3) Finally, the most recent transfer pricing case—Amazon—shows that the Court still upholds the prior precedential cases through stare decisis. Moreover—and perhaps more importantly in the international context regarding other countries’ decision to implement Action 9—had the IRS brought the argument of Action 9 forward, not only would the entire case would have been analyzed differently, but the prospect of bringing Action 9’s reasoning forward, the IRS would have for forfeited all claims to the pricing of the transferred intellectual property (IP) to the “empty company”—as will be shown later.",TRUE,FALSE,BEPS|International Tax Law|OECD|Transfer Pricing|US Tax Law,2018-07-02T11:10:48.816091,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-05T23:43:11.412543,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1e|Law|Taxation-Transnational,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/citation/,nf98w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u7tkr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/relationships/node/,u7tkr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59af358fb83f69025483a9da/,59af358fb83f69025483a9da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nf98w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nf98w,NA

This paper subjects this observation to empirical scrutiny using statistical analyses of new democracies over the past half-century and a case study. Contrary to Huntington’s suggestion, I argue that new democracies growing out of mass mobilization are more likely to survive than new democracies that were born amidst quiescence. Survival analysis of 112 young democracies in 80 different countries based on original data show that the longer the mobilization, the more likely the ensuing democracy is to survive. I use a case study of South Africa to investigate the mechanisms. I argue that sustained unarmed uprisings have generated the longest-lasting new democracies. These uprisings are forced to develop an organizational structure, which provides a leadership cadre for the new regime, forges links between the government and society, and strengthens checks on the power of the post-transition government.",TRUE,FALSE,contentious politics|democratic consolidation|democratic deepening|democratic survival|democratization|mobilization|nonviolence|social movements,2018-07-02T11:10:48.529384,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-05T13:35:22.055061,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/citation/,nqbhm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v4fcw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/relationships/node/,v4fcw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59aea78e6c613b02536acd0f/,59aea78e6c613b02536acd0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqbhm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nqbhm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nqbhm,NA

Hodges. I reject arguments that the movement is likely to enter a period of decline and argue that we should analyze the post-marriage movement developmentally. The LGBT movement is actually multiple movements made up of numerous strands developed over time. This developmental approach views movements as a set of organizations and actors who are best served by keeping these numerous strands active and available to call on in times of need. In uncertain political times where the movement seeks to defend its gains and gain new ones, it can resist decline by activating and institutionalizing these numerous strands.

Why might such norms persist?  Existing approaches see this issue as an information problem, where individuals misconstrue a norm as popular among others, and conform so as to feign their endorsement.  But even when the unpopularity of the norm is revealed, conformity sometimes continues.  My theory thus identifies when and why individuals might conform to such visibly unpopular norms by focusing on the need to credibly signal commitment to their interactants in nascent relationships.  For embedded relationships to be beneficial, individuals need to discern whether their relationship partners are committed to collective interests over individual interests.  In this context, conformity to a visibly unpopular norm signals that the conformist is willing to violate her own preference to meet a behavioral standard demanded by the collective (i.e., norm).  Insofar as actors recognize this signaling value, visibly unpopular norms persist.  Using both qualitative and experimental methods, I leverage a visibly unpopular “ideal-worker” norm – norm around excessive drinking in after-hour business gatherings in South Korea – to test this theory. A macro implication is that an unpopular norm might persist not despite visible unpopularity but precisely because of visible unpopularity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:10:46.295580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T17:36:00.350743,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Minjae Kim,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/citation/,93krj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wmvez/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/relationships/node/,wmvez,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ac3cdd594d9002537d710f/,59ac3cdd594d9002537d710f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93krj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93krj,NA
