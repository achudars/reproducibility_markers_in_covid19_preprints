Recent statistics from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) indicate that 93 percent of individuals aged 65 and older were covered by Medicare in 2013. Those without Medicare include those who are not eligible for the public health program, though the CPS ASEC estimate may also be impacted by misreporting. Using linked data from the CPS ASEC and Medicare Enrollment Database (i.e., the Medicare administrative data), we estimate the extent to which individuals misreport their Medicare coverage. We focus on those who report having Medicare but are not enrolled (false positives) and those who do not report having Medicare but are enrolled (false negatives). We use regression analyses to evaluate factors associated with both types of misreporting including socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. We then provide estimates of the implied Medicare-covered, insured, and uninsured older population, taking into account misreporting in the CPS ASEC. We find an undercount in the CPS ASEC estimates of the Medicare covered population of 4.5 percent. This misreporting is not random - characteristics associated with misreporting include citizenship status, year of entry, labor force participation, Medicare coverage of others in the household, disability status, and imputation of Medicare responses. When we adjust the CPS ASEC estimates to account for misreporting, Medicare coverage of the population aged 65 and older increases from 93.4 percent to 95.6 percent while the uninsured rate decreases from 1.4 percent to 1.3 percent.",TRUE,FALSE,Administrative records|health insurance|Medicare|Survey measurement error,2018-07-02T10:49:04.252709,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-17T16:23:02.346000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/citation/,ejcdm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uzgwm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/relationships/node/,uzgwm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/587e43569ad5a1021fa75f17/,587e43569ad5a1021fa75f17,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejcdm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ejcdm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ejcdm,NA

Past research has found a strong relationship between the local concentrations of a racial minority group and increased representation among police, as well as evidence of the disparate treatment of Blacks and Hispanics by White police officers. Using confidential, establishment-level public employment data on police departments from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, linked to Census local labor market data, we examine how department size and local demographic dynamics are associated with Black/Hispanic underrepresentation in policing. We find that police departments in labor markets with larger Black and Hispanic populations, and those with a greater number of officers on their force, are more likely to report underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic officers relative to the labor market. However, the effect of local population composition is reduced for bigger departments, suggesting a positive effect of organization visibility on minority police integration. In addition, the presence of Blacks and Hispanics in top leadership positions is positively associated with proportional representation, suggesting that minorities in leadership positions may have a beneficial impact on Black and Hispanic officer hiring.",TRUE,FALSE,EEOC|employment discrimination|policing|racial inequality,2018-07-02T10:46:26.660008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-14T23:09:20.348000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/citation/,5zykt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/upkcz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/relationships/node/,upkcz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/587aae809ad5a10202a1a85e/,587aae809ad5a10202a1a85e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zykt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zykt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5zykt,NA

Empirical evidence is drawn from the Academy conversion scheme for secondary schools in England that was recently pursued by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government. The opt-in nature of the reform makes it possible to discern the impact that nominally apolitical school governors have on the implementation of the policy. Academy conversion is disproportionately found in more Conservative-voting constituencies due to varying school-level propensities to apply to convert, rather than varying propensities for the Department for Education to authorize conversions. Further, applications to convert are significantly more likely from schools in Conservative parliamentary seats that are under the control of Labour local authorities. Thus, nominally apolitical policy participants appear to act in rather political ways, which has implications for our understanding of the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:47:29.590015,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-13T23:04:01.550000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/citation/,8fhvq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tgu4e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/relationships/node/,tgu4e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58795c02b83f6901fe173877/,58795c02b83f6901fe173877,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fhvq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8fhvq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8fhvq,https://doi.org/10.1111/padm.12100

Privatization, Encompassing Interests, and the Left","I present a theoretical account of the politics of privatization that predicts left-wing support for the policy is conditional on the proportionality of the electoral system. In contrast to accounts that see privatization as an inherently right-wing policy, I argue that, like trade policy, it has the feature of creating distributed benefits and concen- trated costs. Less proportional electoral systems create incentives for the Left to be responsive to those who face the concentrated costs, and thus for them to oppose privatization more strongly. More proportional systems reduce these incentives and increase the extent to which distributed benefits are internalized by elected representatives. Hypotheses are derived from this theory at both the individual and macro-policy level, and then tested separately. Quantitative evidence on public opinion from the 1990s and privatization revenues from Western European countries over the period 19802005 supports the argument.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:53:43.682798,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-13T22:40:20.469000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/citation/,uuqxg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uqd27/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/relationships/node/,uqd27,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/587955a39ad5a101ffa1acd1/,587955a39ad5a101ffa1acd1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uuqxg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uuqxg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uuqxg,https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.11

To what extent do people change responses to include or exclude American Indian? How are people who change responses similar to or different from those who do not? How are people who join a group similar to or different from those who leave it? We find considerable race response change by people in our data, especially by multiple-race and/or Hispanic American Indians. This turnover is hidden in cross-sectional comparisons because people joining the group are similar in number and characteristics to those who leave the group. People in our data who changed their race response to add or drop American Indian differ from those who kept the same race response in 2000 and 2010 and from those who moved between a single-race and multiple-race American Indian response. Those who consistently reported American Indian (including those who added or dropped another race response) were relatively likely to report a tribe, live in an American Indian area, report American Indian ancestry, and live in the West. There are significant differences between those who joined and those who left a specific American Indian response group, but poor model fit indicates general similarity between joiners and leavers. Response changes should be considered when conceptualizing and operationalizing “the American Indian and Alaska Native population.”",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:47:31.853966,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-14T21:03:57.895000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/citation/,94qfz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/49ybm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/relationships/node/,49ybm,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/587790e96c613b01fa6d100f/,587790e96c613b01fa6d100f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94qfz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/94qfz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/94qfz,NA

Critical to this work is an understanding of the coverage of the population by administrative records. Using federal and third party administrative data linked to the American Community Survey (ACS), we evaluate the extent to which administrative records provide data on foreign-born individuals in the ACS and employ multinomial logistic regression techniques to evaluate characteristics of those who are in administrative records relative to those who are not. We find that overall, administrative records provide high coverage of foreign-born individuals in our sample for whom a match can be determined. The odds of being in administrative records are found to be tied to the processes of immigrant assimilation – naturalization, higher English proficiency, educational attainment, and full-time employment are associated with greater odds of being in administrative records. These findings suggest that as immigrants adapt and integrate into U.S. society, they are more likely to be involved in government and commercial processes and programs for which we are including data. We further explore administrative records coverage for the two largest race/ethnic groups in our sample – Hispanic and non-Hispanic single-race Asian foreign born, finding again that characteristics related to assimilation are associated with administrative records coverage for both groups. However, we observe that neighborhood context impacts Hispanics and Asians differently.",TRUE,FALSE,Administrative records|American Community Survey|Foreign born|Record Linkage,2018-07-02T10:52:05.862633,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-12T14:19:37.332000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/citation/,rnx5g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9xe3m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/relationships/node/,9xe3m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58778ba09ad5a10202a1a267/,58778ba09ad5a10202a1a267,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnx5g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rnx5g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rnx5g,NA
