The first pre-translation phase consists in introducing the author, his/her works, style and the text to be translated. The second phase, the translation proper, is divided into three sub-phases: (a) the identification of problems (connotative meanings, figures of speech, idioms, uncommon collocations, culture-bound items, …), (b) the treatment of these problems by opting for the adequate procedures which should be in tune with the overall translation strategy opted for, and (c) the translation of the whole text into the target language. The final third phase is of revision and assessment. The criteria to be taken into consideration are genre-related and the focus is on the stylistic match or mismatch between the source and target texts. The present process-oriented method of literary translation is illustrated through three in-class translations of three literary texts from Arabic into English and vice versa. The targeted students are enrolled in the Master of Translation Science and Linguistics during Fall-Semester 2017 at the Faculty of Humanities at the University Abdelmalek Essaadi.

Lessing portrays a world in which oppression by a male-dominated society is at the root of countless problems. It depicts the effects of global warming in the future emphasizing that the domination of women is the core of all crises in the environment. The novel implies that women are able to lead as most of the female characters in the novel play the role of the leader starting from Daima, the woman who protects Mara and Dann as children, to Orphne the woman who heals Dann from addiction. Applying Greta Claire Gaard’s (1993) principles of ecofeminism to literature classifies and justifies the cause of the movement (p. 20).

SAs are grouped into systematic combination depending on the purpose of the speaker or the playwright. Direct of fit is the most decisive aspect of the combination of some hybrid speech acts. The pragma-stylistics analysis of hybrid (SAs) also reveals the importance of these speech acts in conveying the intended message of the dramatist through the contextual details offered about the characters and events.

It also examines the amount of translation loss resulting from this process. Moreover, the paper highlights some reasons which made translators of the meanings of the Holy Quran lose sight of part of the culture-bound, culture sensitive and language-bound schemata. Euphemism and synonymy, however, were addressed in so far as schemata are concerned. The paper also endeavors to suggest solutions, when possible, to make up for the amount of translation loss resulting from the formal or functional equivalence opted for by many translators of the meanings of the Holy Quran which led to the activation of slightly, and sometimes utterly, different schemata. However, the translation loss is inevitable in many cases. The findings of the present paper are expected to be useful information in the translation of the meanings of the Holy Quran studies and other related areas.

Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements. Culture plays an important role in the course of the idiom interpretation. Only by having a solid foundation of the culture of the target language, the translator can catch the implied meaning. It, therefore, requires enhancing cross-cultural awareness and needs open-minded understanding of the culture of the second language from different aspects. Moreover, the difference between the source language and the target language as well as variations in their cultures makes the process of translating a real challenge. The present paper tries to investigate and identify firstly some existing obstacles in the process of translating idiomatic pairs, and then suggests some theoretical strategies to overcome such difficulties. Following Baker’s (1992) classification of difficulties and strategies and the related sub-categories, the findings show that there are number of factors which should be considered in order to translate idiomatic expressions correctly.

Using a national random sample of American adults, this study examines the link between religion, gender traditionalism, and attitudes toward same-sex unions by utilizing a novel measure of gender traditionalism that is distinctly religious as well. Recent work on images of God reveals that individuals’ views of the divine provide a glimpse of their underlying view of reality. The results suggest that individuals who view God as a “he” are much less favorable toward same-sex unions than those who do not view God as masculine, even while controlling for gender traditionalist beliefs and other images of God. Individuals who view God as masculine are signaling a belief in an underlying gendered reality that influences their perceptions of the proper ordering of that reality, which extends to marriage patterns. These findings encourage future research to identify innovative measures of religion that incorporate aspects of other social institutions to account for their interconnected nature.",TRUE,FALSE,Gay Marriage|Gender|Homosexuality|Images of God|Religion|Same-Sex Marriage|United States,2018-07-02T11:09:34.846790,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-01T14:28:14.983371,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/citation/,32rhj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pbzu6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/relationships/node/,pbzu6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a96e296c613b025469b402/,59a96e296c613b025469b402,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32rhj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/32rhj/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12130,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/32rhj

Although we agree that strict mind-body dualism should be laid to rest, we believe that replacing this dichotomy with a holistic theory risks making it harder for researchers to see analytic distinctions that make a real difference. We use examples from Loic Wacquant's Body and Soul to illustrate our argument that sociologists should replace the old dualism with a new, improved one that incorporates cognitive science regarding differences between habitual, embodied cognition and intentional, discursive cognition. This will help microsociologists and cognitive scientists be in the best possible position to understand, enrich, and improve each other’s work.",TRUE,FALSE,analytical sociology|cognition|culture|dualism|habitus|microsociology,2018-07-02T11:09:34.125644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-01T01:58:07.175180,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Stephen Vaisey and Margaret Frye,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/citation/,p2w5c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mxv3n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/relationships/node/,mxv3n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a8bb679ad5a1025e81e605/,59a8bb679ad5a1025e81e605,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p2w5c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p2w5c/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p2w5c
