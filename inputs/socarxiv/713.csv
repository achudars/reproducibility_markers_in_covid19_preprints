the local environment. This paper analyzes, on the one hand, the urban
disparities on public access to waste collection services (WCS) in the
North-East Region, on the other hand, it performs a comparative analysis
between 2003 and 2010 outlining the changes made in the context of
Romania’s accession to
EU. Also, it performs a quantitative assessment method of uncollected waste
at urban level and correlated to demographic features of each city.
Spatial-temporal analysis of waste indicators using thematic cartography or
GIS techniques should be a basic tool for environmental monitoring or
assessment of projects from this field in every development region (NUTS
2). The EU acquis requires the closure of noncompliant landfills, the
extension of waste collection services, the development of facilities for
separate collection, recycling and reuse according to waste hierarchy
concept. Full coverage of urban population to waste collection services is
necessary to provide a proper management of this sector. Urban disparities
between counties and within counties highlights that current traditional
waste management system is an environmental threat at local and regional
scale.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,cartography|cities|environment|environmental sociology|geography|Preprint|public policy|public services|public utilities|socarxiv|urban geography|urban studies|waste management,2018-07-02T10:51:49.013640,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-29T13:20:55.699000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/citation/,pxhzc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uap4j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/relationships/node/,uap4j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/579b583a594d9001f1d0870c/,579b583a594d9001f1d0870c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pxhzc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pxhzc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pxhzc
