Exploring the Relationship Between Disapproval of Organizations and Job Satisfaction in the French Context.,"Previous research has found that a positive relationship exists between favorable perception of a firm and employees’ job satisfaction: the more positively an organization is perceived, the happier are its workers. However, the current literature has overlooked the consequences of a negative corporate image, or disapproval of organizations. Building on the concept of organizational identification and the social identity literature, we fill in this gap and counterintuitively argue that employees are more likely to identify and align with their organizations when it faces illegitimate criticism. We test our hypotheses on a large-scale survey collected in France and find that perception of disapproval of an organization has indeed an adverse effect on job satisfaction. However, if employees perceive criticism as illegitimate, job satisfaction is positively impacted. This study suggests the existence of micro-level social identity reactions in case of unjustified disapprobation: employees stick together and hold the line against criticism, strengthening the collective identity and adding positive emotional value to the work experience.",TRUE,FALSE,disapproval|job satisfaction|legitimacy|motivation|organizational theory|sociology,2018-07-02T10:55:51.410362,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-22T16:28:03.491719,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/citation/,wez38,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fe3ym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/relationships/node/,fe3ym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58fb83d7594d90024eb6883f/,58fb83d7594d90024eb6883f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wez38/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wez38,NA

Our objective was to estimate the association between increases in mortality in middle-aged non-Hispanic white adults from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015, health inequalities in life expectancy by income, and the surge in support for the Republican Party in pivotal US counties in the 2016 presidential election. We conducted a longitudinal ecological study in 2764 US counties from 1999 to 2016. Increases in mortality were measured using age-specific (45-54 years of age) all-cause mortality from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015 at the county level. Support for the Republican Party was measured as the party’s vote share in the presidential election in 2016 adjusted for results in 2008 and 2012. We found a significant up-turn in mortality from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015 in counties where the Democratic Party won twice (2008 and 2012) but where the Republican Party won in 2016 (+10.7/100,000), as compared to those in which the Democratic Party won in 2016 (-15.7/100,000). An increase in mortality of 15.2/100,000 was associated with a significant (p&lt;0.001) 1% vote swing from the 2008-2012 average to 2016. We also found that counties with wider health inequalities in life expectancy were more likely to vote Republican in 2016, regardless of the previous voting patterns. Counties with worsening premature mortality in the last 15 years and wider health inequalities shifted votes toward the Republican Party presidential candidate. Further understanding of causes of unanticipated deterioration in health in the general population can inform social policy.

The method is illustrated with raster grids on tornadoes occurring between 1955 and 2015 within the most tornado-prone region of the United States. Validation of the results using county- and grid-level data reveals strong correlation between dasymetric estimated and location-specific counts. On a broad spatial scale the method provides a better estimate of where casualties have occurred than counting the number of casualty-producing tornadoes. Case studies using the 1974 Xenia, OH and the 1994 Piedmont, AL tornadoes highlight limitations of the method and indicate that results will be improved with more precise tornado path information.

Research demonstrates a link between aggregate unemployment and employed individuals’ perceptions of job insecurity; however, less is known about whether the stress associated with these perceptions is shaped by others’ unemployment experiences. We analyze a nationally representative sample of Canadian workers (CAN-WSH study; N=3,900) linked to census data, and test whether regional unemployment influences the mental health consequences of job insecurity. Multilevel analyses provide more support for the social norm of insecurity hypothesis over the amplified threat hypothesis: the health penalties of job insecurity are weaker for individuals in high unemployment regions.

Recent legal and policy changes within two prominent institutions, the military and criminal justice system, have profoundly altered the visibility – and subsequent rights – of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) service members and those currently incarcerated. Comparing these two institutions side-by-side illustrates how LGBT inequality mechanisms operate at both an individual and systemic level. Both the military and criminal justice system are total, hypermasculine institutions, both are socially concentrated experiences, both end with a changed relationship with the state, and both veterans and those formerly incarcerated have comparable challenges to reintegration upon returning to their communities. Intersectional analysis provides an apt tool to critically examine how reintegration processes differ for those identifying as LGBT. I examine ways in which existing literature is intersectional and highlight the lack of analyses about systems of power that amplify or moderate former prisoner re-entry and veteran transition for those identifying as LGBT. Finally, I discuss why there may be a lack of attention to intersectionality, and specifically to LGBT individuals, in the literature and address how an intersectional framework would contribute to both public policy and to expanding the existing literature on social inequality and stratification.",TRUE,FALSE,ex-offender re-entry|former prisoner|gender identity|intersectionality|LGBT|military|sexual orientation|stratification|veteran,2018-07-02T10:55:50.849007,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-19T20:01:12.620231,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Brittany N.

Results show that most HR professionals value social media and online search data, though some question its accuracy and usefulness. The majority recognize that because online information emphasizes personal and ascribed traits, it can potentially result in hiring discrimination. They use four strategies to cope with this discriminatory potential.

FANS), this paper examines the association between the presence of co-resident extended kin and children’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The paper demonstrates the differential role of extended kin by family structure, as well as across parental immigrant status – specifically, nativity and documentation status. Children in the sample were found to be disadvantaged in extended family households, especially with regard to internalizing behaviors. This disadvantageous association was found mostly among married-parent extended family households, whereas there was no association between the presence of extended kin and behavior problems in children from single-parent families. This pattern emerged more clearly among children of documented immigrants, compared to those with native-born parents and those whose parents were unauthorized immigrants. These findings suggest a need to modify previous theories on extended family living arrangements; they also provide policy implications for immigrant families.",TRUE,FALSE,children|extended households|family structure|immigrants|internalizing and externalizing behavior problems|undocumented immigrants,2018-07-02T10:55:50.460495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-18T14:55:28.144506,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",Jeehye Kang &amp; Philip N.

I explore if Christmas celebrations translated into typical foodways and if so, by whom, when and why the translation took place. Building on the notion of heritagization, the analysis shows that Christmas was interpreted in light of convivial family life and although food played a role in bringing together the family around the Christmas table, the menu did not speak of typical dishes. The analysis deals with mentality history, and its cultural expression through food and foodways, providing an understanding of how people used food to forge a sense of community.",TRUE,FALSE,Christmas|Festive Culture|Heritagization|Typicality|Women's Magazines,2018-07-02T10:55:50.404234,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-17T20:25:22.357243,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies,Anneke Geyzen,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/citation/,fe7db,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpzae/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/relationships/node/,tpzae,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58f523fe594d900251bd56bf/,58f523fe594d900251bd56bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fe7db/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fe7db/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fe7db,NA

Crucialmente, a tecnologia educacional é agora um negócio multibilionário que envolve corporações globais em nível de práticas e provisão locais. A necessidade de se questionar criticamente a Educação e a Tecnologia é mais premente do que nunca. Este capítulo apresenta algumas questões fundamentais que precisam ser verbalizadas diante de tais avanços. Em particular, retoma os sete desafios críticos propostos pelo teórico das mídias Neil Postman. Ainda que Postman tenha se preocupado com o efeito dos computadores e da Internet nas escolas durante a década de 1990, seus argumentos permanecem relevantes em nossa era de smartphones, big data e computação em nuvem. O texto examina as implicações dessa linha de questionamento crítico para a compreensão do estado atual da Educação e Tecnologia.
