ML interactive installation ""Chat-Hi:"" revisits the question using text generation of Indian Prime Ministers","Situated at the crossroads of computational politics and intellectual history, this essay uses a natural language processing model trained on a large database of speeches from Prime Ministers since 1946 to generate analytically intelligible answers to a much-debated question: what is the idea of India? Building on Khilnani’s account on the inclusive and modernist endeavour of the makers of postcolonial India, this text revisits the argument by contrasting Jawaharlal Nehru’s emphasis on diversity with Narendra Modi’s stress on unity. We argue that the gradual political deepening of the Hindu nationalist project in the country durably amends the state-sponsored idea of India. The article further discusses the epistemic status of ‘human’ insights derived from machine learning outputs.

Based on publication data about Chinese researchers in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) from the Web of Science (WoS), this study aims to provide a birds-eye view of how social science research in Mainland China has internationalized over the past four decades. The findings show that the number of social science articles published by Chinese authors in international journals has experienced a noticeable increase over the period and the collaboration networks of researchers from Mainland China have broadened, with the number of articles with a Chinese first author showing a strong upward trend. In addition, findings show that Chinese scholars are published in a wider range of journals and there has been a steady increase in their appearance in higher impact journals (influenced in part by certain journals). Finally, different social science disciplines show various degrees of internationalization, with Psychology and Business, Economics, Planning accounting for a high proportion of international collaboration articles, while the proportion of Mainland China-led articles and Q1 articles are relatively higher in the areas of Education, Media &amp; Information, and Community &amp; Social Issues.

The  Importance  of  Heteronomous  Networks in  the Swiss Field of Economists (1980-2000),"Economists often argue that economics is a “pure” and “autonomous” discipline. In contrast, the relatively dense institutional and interpersonal networks owned by economists show how the discipline stands at the edge of several social fields and thus can be particularly heteronomous. These networks provide a certain volume and form of social capital which strengthen the discipline, but also highlight its important porousness toward extra-academic powers. Very few studies have focused on the importance of social capital in fields and, to our knowledge, no research has systematically investigated the role of intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary social capital in economics. This chapter aims to focus on the structure and evolution of social capital in the Swiss field of economists. It relies on an original prosopographical database of all economics professors at Swiss universities between 1980 and 2000 (n=200). We exploit the data in two ways: First, through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), we identify two structuring forces among economists. The main opposition is marked by the volume of extra-disciplinary social capital, and the volume of intra-disciplinarity capital only comes in a second place. Second, we show, through class-specific MCA, that, despite the fact that intra-disciplinary social capital gains in importance in the recent period, extra-disciplinary social capital remains the prime structuring logic across time. Although the particularly strong cohesion and autonomy that characterise the discipline, this chapter points out the importance of heteronomous networks, which attest that economics is and stays much less autonomous than economists would argue.",TRUE,FALSE,Bourdieu|Economics|Economists|Elites|Multiple correspondence analysis|Network|Social capital,2020-05-04T15:04:33.800482,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-02T11:39:10.392438,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Thierry Rossier and Pierre Benz,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/citation/,ufhzd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eab035476188b02c6910c1a/,5eab035476188b02c6910c1a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufhzd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufhzd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufhzd,NA

Increasingly, the option for consumers to retain their current supplier whilst taking on additional contracts with local suppliers is viewed as having the potential to support growth of local renewable energy. This study took a behavioural economic approach and conducted two pre-registered nationally representative survey experiments (n=1042, n=762). The main aims of the study were to assess the attractiveness of a multiple supplier model for British consumers and to understand the role of default effects and associated cognitive biases (loss-aversion, cognitive effort and implied endorsement) in consumers’ decisions to remain with incumbent suppliers. Results showed that participants were significantly more likely to engage with local energy suppliers under a multiple supplier model than the current single supplier model. In one experiment, consumers’ preference for adding a local supplier under a multiple supplier model was so strong that it overcame default effects. The perception that the supplier has been recommended (i.e. implied endorsement) was the most robust mechanism associated with remaining with default suppliers, suggesting that explicit endorsement of local suppliers may encourage engagement with the energy market.

Drawing on narrative interviews and individual lifelines conducted as part of a cross-national European study, we describe and explain how age-differentiated lives and times intersected with ill-timed transitions and patterns of inter-generational relations, leading to variations in resilient future orientations. Our analysis yields three key findings. First, failed expectations for intra-generational social mobility, combined with inter-generational obligations, gave rise to negative future orientations amongst those in mid-life.
Second, the crisis created multiple negative life changes that compounded the accumulated costs of poorly timed transitions and adverse experiences within biographies. The effect of this varied by generational cohort, life course stage (with its implications for inter-generational obligations), gender and social class. Third, both life course stage and biographical experience affected peoples’ orientations towards the future, with implications for their resilience.",TRUE,FALSE,Anticipation|Biography|Future orientations|Life course|Resilience,2020-05-04T15:03:19.086292,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-30T11:18:00.244855,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/citation/,tjbr4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaa93e1e4f0810281075cb8/,5eaa93e1e4f0810281075cb8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjbr4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tjbr4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tjbr4,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2019.100293

This study fills such a gap by applying an integrated classification framework to the analysis of the commonalities and differences in political issues that appeared in 78,305 articles from Asian American and African American newspapers from the 1960s to the 1980s. The automated text classification shows that Asian American newspapers focused on promoting collective gains more often than African American newspapers. Conversely, African American newspapers concentrated on preventing collective losses more than Asian American newspapers. The content analysis demonstrates that the issue priorities varied between the corpora, especially with respect to policy contexts. Gaining access to government resources was a more urgent issue for Asian Americans, while reducing or ending state violence, such as police brutality, was a more pressing matter for African Americans. It also helped avoid extreme interpretations of the machine coding, as the misalignment of political agendas between the two corpora widened up to 10 times when the training data were measured using the minimum, rather than the maximum, reliability threshold.",TRUE,FALSE,African American politics|Asian American politics|Computational text analysis|Machine learning|Racial and ethnic politics,2020-05-04T15:03:04.450098,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-30T11:26:37.805903,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/citation/,pg3aq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaa732276188b02a19121db/,5eaa732276188b02a19121db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3aq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pg3aq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pg3aq,NA

First results from the LISS Panel.,"The outbreak of the Corona virus has led to unprecedented measures in education. 
From March 16, all schools in the Netherlands are closed, and children must keep up with their schoolwork from home. Parents are expected to take a crucial role in this “homeschooling”: they are primarily responsible for ensuring that their children follow the curriculum. In this article I report the first results of a module in the LISS Panel that was designed to map how parents school their children in primary and secondary education. Data on a nationally representative sample of 1,318 children in primary and secondary education were gathered in April. The results show marked differences between social groups. Whereas all parents find it important that their children keep up with the schoolwork, children from advantaged backgrounds receive much more parental support and have more resources (e.g., own computer) to study from home. Differences in parental support are driven by the ability to help: parents with a higher education degree feels themselves much capable to help their children with schoolwork than lower educated parents. Parents also report that schools provide more extensive distant schooling for children in the academic track in secondary education (vwo) than for children in the pre-vocational track (vmbo). Finally, there is a clear gender gap: parents feel much more capable to support their daughters than their sons.	These initial findings provide clear indications that the school shutdown in the Netherlands is likely to have strong effects on the inequality in educational opportunities.",TRUE,FALSE,corona|covid-19|education|homeschooling|inequality|netherlands|opportunity,2020-05-04T15:03:16.468200,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-30T11:19:27.235636,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/citation/,hf32q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k4r9w/,k4r9w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaa699be4f081026b0778f8/,5eaa699be4f081026b0778f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hf32q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hf32q,NA

Not since the Spanish Flu in 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic and this has motivated many countries across globe to take a series of unprecedented actions in an effort to curb the spread and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Among these government and regulatory interventions includes unprecedented domestic and international travel restrictions as well as a raft of stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. Each has left criminologists wondering what impact this will have on crime in both the short- and long-term. In this study, we examine officially recorded violent crime rates for the month of March, 2020, as reported for the state of Queensland, Australia. We use ARIMA modeling techniques to compute six-month-ahead forecasts of common assault, serious assault, sexual offence and domestic violence order breach rates and then compare these forecasts (and their 95\% confidence intervals) with the observed data for March 2020. We conclude that the observed rates of reported violent offending across Queensland were not--at least not so far--significantly different from what was expected given the history of each offence series.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|COVID-19|Crime|Police|Queensland|SARS-CoV-2|Violence,2020-05-04T15:02:51.832379,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-30T11:27:08.489542,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Jason Payne and Anthony Morgan,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/citation/,g4kh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaa29313854e2025f6a105d/,5eaa29313854e2025f6a105d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4kh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g4kh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g4kh7,NA
