Tracking Differences in Associations among Active Travel, Socioeconomics, Gentrification, and Self-reported Health","While the health benefits of cycling and walking have been well established, questions remain about whether these benefits hold in varying socioeconomic contexts, including across demographic groups and in the context of neighborhood change. This study examines this relationship, identifying associations between cycling or walking and self-reported health, whether socioeconomic status moderates these associations, and whether gentrification influences the potential moderating effects. This study uses the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, subset to adults who lived in central cities (n = 88,698). Weighted ordered logistic regression models were fit to estimate self-reported health status separately for cycling and walking. Gentrification was measured using an indicator based on previous research using US Census data. People who had cycled in the past week and each additional walking trip were associated with higher odds of reporting better health. Socioeconomic status moderated the positive associations between active transportation and health in a few key cases. Cycling was not as strongly associated with health for Black cyclists or employed cyclists, while women had smaller benefits from each additional walking trip compared to men. Gentrification was an insignificant moderating factor in most cases. Findings suggest planning efforts that continue to support programs that promote cycling and walking are crucial tools in the public health toolbox. The health gains from active transportation might be experienced in a variety of neighborhood contexts.

These rules are intended to support instructors who seek to encourage ethical conduct in (throughout) the practice of science, whether it involves statistics, data science, or qualitative analysis; as well as throughout the employment of tools, methods, and techniques from these domains. Truly integrated ethical training can also promote awareness of the fact that every member of a research – or practice -  team has a specific role, with attendant obligations and priorities, relating to the use of statistics, data science, and qualitative analytic approaches. Even if individuals are not going to be the ‘designated statistician/analyst’ on a project, understanding the roles and responsibilities of team members can strengthen the sense of responsibility and accountability of each member of a science or practice team. True integration of ethical training is not simple to achieve, but the ten rules are based on educational and cognitive sciences, as well as a recognition of the fact that additional content, without furthering a course’s existing learning objectives, greatly dampens enthusiasm for, and the likelihood of, integration of ethical training into quantitative courses. Assumptions for readers of these ten simple rules are: the instructor wants to have something that can be graded/evaluated after the students engage with the case; and that one objective the reader has is to teach how to reason &amp; make decisions ethically as students go about practicing or using statistics. The overarching message of the ten rules is that true integration can benefit from leveraging existing structural features that both streamline learning outcomes and increase the chance of successfully embedding ethical practice standards into existing courses. Success is defined as the creation of reproducible, gradable work from students that signal whether or not the ethics instruction had its intended effects; and the documentation of ongoing (sustained) engagement with the ethics training beyond the end of the course.",TRUE,FALSE,ethical reasoning; ethics training; data science; statistics; statistics education; curriculum development,2020-08-15T21:41:40.906565,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-15T21:41:30.248095,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/citation/,z9uej,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f31a44147928800fb8596af/,5f31a44147928800fb8596af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9uej/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z9uej/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z9uej,NA

Social and political outcomes of the Spanish housing movement,"This study investigates whether housing movements can produce 
significant outcomes. In particular, I examine the case of the Platform 
for People Affected by Mortgages (PAH), the main organization in 
the Spanish housing movement between 2009 and 2017. First, 
I discuss how their demands were framed according to specific 
contexts of legitimation. Second, I distinguish the nature and scope 
of the outcomes produced by this movement. My analysis uniquely 
combines a critical assessment of the PAH’s achievements with its 
unintended consequences and the significant social, political and 
economic contexts that help to explain its major outcomes. The 
global financial crisis, the convergence of the PAH with other anti-
neoliberal movements and shifts among the dominant political 
parties determine the opportunities and constraints of the PAH’s 
development. Within this environment, the housing movement 
strategically operates by framing the culprits of the economic crisis 
in a new manner and by appealing to a broad social base beyond the 
impoverished mortgage holders. I also include the capacity of the 
movement’s organization to last, expand and increase its legitimacy 
as a relevant socio-political outcome. This is explained here through 
the articulation of the PAH’s agency (organizational form and protest 
repertoire) within the aforementioned contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Housing movement|Movement’s outcomes|Political contexts|Spain,2020-08-11T13:16:35.619381,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T13:04:52.716288,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/citation/,thfsz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f31754775d29f00df173a33/,5f31754775d29f00df173a33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/thfsz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/thfsz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/thfsz,https://doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2018.1447094

conducting fieldwork on the streets. Off-line demonstrations, protests with 
gathering bodies and banners, deliberative assemblies and the like have been on 
hold for a long period in countries such as Spain. The coronavirus pandemic and 
the stringent measures taken by the government have set an unprecedented 
situation in terms of social life and politics, especially for the generations who 
did not live under the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1978), where surveillance 
and repression determined daily routines and anti-regime mobilisations. The 
current ruling coalition between the social democratic party, PSOE, and the 
more leftist Unidas Podemos, had opened up a promising term for, at least, 
some progressive policies since they took office in January 2020. However, the 
sudden economic crisis that the pandemic is unfolding has abruptly 
undermined even the least optimistic prospects. 
As a regular online observer of bottom-up organisations, campaigns, and 
collective actions, as well as a follower of the debates that stir and flood the 
political sphere in Spain, I was surprised by some of the innovative ways of 
continuing to protest during these difficult times of home confinement, starting 
March 15, 2020, when the government declared a state of emergency. 
Obviously, online protests are not new at all but, in this short period of time, 
activists explored appealing forms of articulating discourse and campaigns. 
Grassroots mobilisations for social justice have included practices and 
challenges to the authorities previously unforeseen. In particular, the following 
selection of experiences resembles the context of the 2008 global financial 
crisis, although some dimensions have changed too. Hence, this preliminary 
analysis aims at understanding what seems like the first stage of an emerging 
cycle of mutating mobilisations.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19 pandemic|social movements|Spain,2020-08-15T21:40:56.536638,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-15T21:40:31.144841,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/citation/,4gyxn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f31728d75d29f00da17399f/,5f31728d75d29f00da17399f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4gyxn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4gyxn,NA

So using renewable resources i.e. solar power to meet the demand of electricity is highly necessary especially rural and remote areas. This paper examined the nature and extent of solar energy in Boyarjapha village of Paikgachha Upazila of Khulna district to analyse the effects of solar panel in their daily life. Many positive impacts of solar power were found out such as better quality lighting, education, entertainment, communications, business, increasing working hours, women empowerment, increasing awareness etc. There are a few bad effects of solar energy too. But Government intervention is a must to ensure better quality results in coming future. Similarly, government has to take serious steps to advertise solar electricity in remote areas of Bangladesh",TRUE,FALSE,renewable energy|rural community|solar energy|women empowerment,2020-08-11T07:21:12.456964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T07:20:41.092128,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/citation/,p4zv6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f30db7547928800b185a598/,5f30db7547928800b185a598,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p4zv6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p4zv6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p4zv6,NA

Travel behavior pattern of the citizens could have both negative and positive influences on the sustainability issue of any transport system. This paper focuses on the steps of the transport demand model with two types of information- demographic information and travel data. Information regarding trip generation, the pattern of trip variation with housing types, modal choices for various purposes along with changes in income variation of citizens in Khulna City were explored using statistical tools and` techniques, and trip distribution modeling was done to find out the factors affecting the trip making behavior. The findings showed that there is present a salubrious relationship between the income level of the people and their mode preferences. However, the total number of trips has influenced mostly by the income of the households where housing condition has a negative impact on the trips produced. Vehicle ownership and family size do not have that much effect on the number of trips generated. So, the consideration of both positive and negative influential variables on the travel pattern can help to outline a sustainable future transportation plan of Khulna City.",TRUE,FALSE,land use|mode choice|sustainable transport system|travel behavior|travel pattern|trip making behavior,2020-08-11T07:20:45.981303,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T07:20:14.452064,FALSE,NA,no,All the data and methods used for the analysis could be accessed by contacting the corresponding author.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/citation/,tc3fm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f30d7a5021ce200adf4433f/,5f30d7a5021ce200adf4433f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc3fm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tc3fm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tc3fm,NA

The low-lying coastal areas are particularly vulnerable, thus placing these population, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock and economic development in a high-risk situation. The situation calls for an effective cyclone warning and dissemination system. With a view to address that this research intends to develop and manage a website containing all the information for helping in taking decision about disaster management. As its common knowledge that disaster victims need immediate, efficient and effective rescue and relief services, this system will provide relief and rescue workers with a platform easy to use, fast to search, retrieve and access information and most importantly will help in preventing the duplication of relief works. Overall, proper co-ordination will be ensured among the existing organization seems to be lacking due to the shortage of effective information dissemination system.",TRUE,FALSE,decision support system|disaster management|relief works|warning and dissemination system,2020-08-11T07:20:00.905673,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T07:19:48.117628,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/citation/,kdpg3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f30d649021ce200adf44223/,5f30d649021ce200adf44223,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdpg3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kdpg3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kdpg3,NA
