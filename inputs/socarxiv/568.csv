Most often sex education policies fall to the state government, resulting in vast differences in policy across the US. In this study I look at two different approaches to sex education: programs in which abstinence is stressed and programs that include information on contraception. Using the Guttmacher Institute’s evaluation of state sex education laws (2015) and The National Campaign to End Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy’s teen birthrates (2015), I have compiled a data set that allows a state-by-state analysis of sex education policies and teen birthrate outcomes. I have also considered the influence of the state’s political leaning on the variables by coding states that voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election as conservative. The findings suggest that controlling for sex education, conservative states have higher teen birthrates. While there appears to be a relationship between the type of sex education and teen birthrate, when conservative is controlled for the relationship disappears. Conservative states have higher teen birthrates than liberal states across all racial categories. Additionally, conservative states were more likely to stress abstinence in their sex education than include information on contraception. Finally, stressing abstinence in sex education has no effect on teen birthrates, while including information on contraception only has an effect on reducing the birthrate for Black teens. It appears that conservative politics may be a better indicator of teen birthrates than sex education requirements.",TRUE,FALSE,conservative politics|gender|sex education|sexuality|teen birth,2018-07-02T11:29:47.819213,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T21:37:22.393422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/citation/,hm3yj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xrk5t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/relationships/node/,xrk5t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3438c195de500011bdd013/,5a3438c195de500011bdd013,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hm3yj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hm3yj,NA

Social media feeds are inundated with political content and are used by politicians and citizens alike to post political commentary. Neither mass media nor politics are new areas of study in sociology, but the entanglement of the two is proving to be of interest, as some scholarship argues that social media is driving changes in how politics works in the United States. We must consider how the citizenry consumes and processes political information in the modern era in view of the interplay between social media and current events. This study examines how membership and/or regular use of Facebook, and membership and/or regular use of Twitter affects perceived political understanding. I propose that, respectively, Facebook and Twitter use will increase perception of political understanding. Analysis of data from the 2016 General Social Survey reveals that Twitter membership and/or regular use is correlated with political understanding; meaning that those who use Twitter are more likely to believe they have an understanding of the political issues facing our country. The data confirms that the relationship between social media and political understanding must be taken seriously, and warrants deeper exploration. There is a need for future research that explores the kinds of content individuals consume on social media and the time they spend on these sites in order to develop a more robust understanding of exactly how social media use affects political understanding",TRUE,FALSE,Facebookbook|Political Understanding|Social Media|Twitter,2018-07-02T11:29:47.662645,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T18:51:15.908278,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/citation/,y4xts,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bc9nh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/relationships/node/,bc9nh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3400706f0d81000d8d4ffc/,5a3400706f0d81000d8d4ffc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4xts/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4xts,NA

However, few comprehensive and systematic reviews on the application of criminological theories in Asia have been conducted. Using a systematic quantitative literature review method on peer-reviewed English-language journal articles, we aim to provide an overview of the use of five major criminological theories in Asia: (1) strain; (2) social learning; (3) control; (4) routine activity; and (5) developmental and life-course. In particular, we address the following four questions: (1) how often are these theories tested in which region of Asia?; (2) what methodology is used to test these theories?; (3) to what extent are these theories supported in the Asian context?; and (4) what cultural uniqueness in the Asian context is taken into account in testing these theories, and what role and effect do they play in analysis and outcome? Findings indicate that the relationship between these theories and the Asian regions is skewed; many studies do not employ rigorous methodologies; these theories are either fully or partially supported in the Asian context; and only a few studies have analyzed the cultural uniqueness of the Asian context, and no effect of cultural uniqueness of the Asian context was found.

I draw on 13 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a welfare-to-work nonprofit that helps unemployed poor women through “style advice” and second-hand business attire. I examine organizational policies along with interactions between staff, volunteers, and clients to understand the extent to which – and how –cultural capital is transmitted to participants. I focus especially on the relationship between “objectified cultural capital” (professional attire, in this case) and clients’ “bodily capital,” which is bounded by the intersecting corporealities of gender, race, class, and body size. I find that, despite providing an essential service to women who need professional attire, the organization reproduces the inequalities it seeks to remedy through uneven distribution of objectified cultural capital, penalizing clients seen as “undeserving” and those with stigmatized embodiments. I use these findings to caution against romanticized understandings of philanthropic efforts to remedy social inequality, while also underscoring the importance of taking embodiment – particularly the striking social disadvantages of larger body size – into account when examining the intersections of gender, race and class.",TRUE,FALSE,Aesthetic Labor|bodily capital|body size|class|embodiment|ethnography|fat studies|gender|objectified body capital|race,2018-07-02T11:29:46.852797,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T04:54:42.207575,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Kjerstin Gruys,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/citation/,6hpcz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g6f87/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/relationships/node/,g6f87,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a331cfc0aeb750011934b5c/,5a331cfc0aeb750011934b5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6hpcz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6hpcz,NA

Social scientists have proposed a variety of explanations, including economic dissatisfaction, sexism, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. The current study establishes that, independent of these influences, voting for Trump was, at least for many Americans, a symbolic defense of the United States’ perceived Christian heritage. Data from a national probability sample of Americans surveyed soon after the 2016 election shows that greater adherence to Christian nationalist ideology was a robust predictor of voting for Trump, even after controlling for economic dissatisfaction, sexism, anti-black prejudice, anti-Muslim refugee attitudes, and anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as measures of religion, sociodemographics, and political identity more generally. These findings indicate that Christian nationalist ideology—although correlated with a variety of class-based, sexist, racist, and ethnocentric views—is not synonymous with, reducible to, or strictly epiphenomenal of such views. Rather, Christian nationalism operates as a unique and independent ideology that can influence political actions by calling forth a defense of mythological narratives about America’s distinctively Christian heritage and future.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 presidential election|Christianity|Christian nationalism|Donald Trump|Islamophobia|politics|religion|sexism|voting|xenophobia,2018-07-02T11:29:46.642489,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T04:53:20.538583,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/citation/,rdn98,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5mtsb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/relationships/node/,5mtsb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a32d3148b8e2d000ed7cc8b/,5a32d3148b8e2d000ed7cc8b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rdn98/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rdn98,NA

Using longitudinal panel data from 2005 to 2014, this study defines three indicators of poverty based on asset holdings, rather than income. It then examines the dynamics of asset poverty in Korea across the study period. The study’s primary goal is to reveal differences across the three indicators and identify which groups of poor people in Korea have been structurally trapped in poverty. We applied a dynamic panel model of discrete choice to the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) from the 1st to 10th waves and show that, despite the indicator, the asset poor who experienced asset poverty in the previous surveyed year or at wave 1 are likely to fall into structural and persistent poverty over time.

This growth in empirical research has run ahead of theories about the nature of local space: to a large extent, contemporary sociology employs the same conceptions of space developed in works of the Chicago School produced between 1918 and the early 1930’s. This article describes three major notions of locality developed by the Chicago School, respectively defined by ecology, institutions, and subjective perceptions. These accounts of locality are not theoretically consistent, and make reference to partially distinct empirical phenomena. A brief survey of contemporary neighborhood research reveals the persistence of these spatial accounts, as well as uncertainty about the goals of neighborhood research. Revisiting the accounts of urban place developed by the Chicago School suggests five distinct ends for research on locality: research programs focusing specifically on ecology, institutions, or perceptions; methodological and theoretical pluralism in pursuit of maximally rich description; and empirical integration seeking to describe the role of multiple processes in the production of local space.

The article shows that public positions on the proposal inverted the typical relationship between partisanship and environmental attitudes, prompting both supporters and opponents to ignore scientific evidence and the central matter of water safety. In successive rounds of state and regional administrative review, these political stances induced administrators to engage in increasingly legalistic forms of assessment. Although Waukesha’s application was approved in 2016, these administrative dynamics may limit the ability of the recently-enacted Great Lakes Compact to address current and prospective water safety problems in the region. The case typifies an emerging pattern in water governance in the United States: contentious administrative politics drive cooperative agreements to resemble adversarial proceedings, in turn limiting their ability to adapt to new environmental problems.

Recent theory has particularly emphasized social interaction and cognition as key sites for understanding judgment, and a number of studies examine gatekeeping practices as a means of understanding the interactive and perceptual determinants of judgment. This article builds upon previous work by presenting the results of an eighteen-month ethnography at a long-running little magazine based in a large American city. In addition to providing an empirical description of an important but understudied domain of cultural production, this article has two findings of theoretical interest. First, without strong external constraints on processes of group evaluation, editors’ judgments became markedly negative, and their deliberations were often inconclusive. Second, negative and positive evaluations were not symmetric, but were produced by two differing sets of evaluative practices. These findings are broadly consistent with developing field theoretic descriptions of social life, but also raise many empirical and theoretical questions.
