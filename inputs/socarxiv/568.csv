Federalism, one of the demands of such transformations, has become a contentious issue for Dalits. Dalit leaders had initially mostly been centered on ensuring proportional representation in central and local governments, along with special rights as a compensation for their historical oppression (Bhattachan 2008). However, after the Peoples’ Movement of 2006, with Janajatis and Madhesis demanding provinces along ethnic and regional lines, Dalit leaders and scholars began to discuss the relevance of federalism for Dalits as well as possibility of their own Dalit province. This issue climaxed with State Restructuring High Commission Report suggesting provision of a non-territorial province for Dalits.
But is a Dalit province, or federalism, needed for Dalits? Is the issue of federalism and Dalit province an aspiration, or a concern, of common Dalits? Or is it just an interest of Dalit leaders and elites? This paper tries to analyse public opinion of Dalits, based on a survey of public opinion in two VDCs of Nepal, on the various issues related to federalism, including aspirations of Dalits in the proposed constitution and perceptions of Dalits on successive political movements and government provisions for Dalits since 1990.",TRUE,FALSE,Dalit|Dalit province|Federalism,2018-07-18T19:27:21.654588,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-18T16:04:41.718158,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/citation/,fn9t5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7b86y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/relationships/node/,7b86y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4f0c206d4eb300106ee1a1/,5b4f0c206d4eb300106ee1a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fn9t5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fn9t5,NA

The purpose of the present study was to examine relationship between the types of posts different people on share on a Facebook page called: “Secret Jaffa” and the amount of attention (measured in “Likes” and “Comments”) given by different members of the group. Data was collected from the latest 50 posts shared in “Secret Jaffa” from members in that group. This study may assist others in understanding what types of posts motivate people to click “Like” or “Comment”, by gaining much of the popularity online. To accomplish this, some of the applicable measures of social networks are centrality, transitivity, clustering, and diameter. The latest posts of 50 participants, 25 men and 25 women, were observed, and tested, for popularity. Results indicate that on average the advertising posts shared in that certain group receive the largest number of social engagements (i.e., likes and comments).",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:08:30.768143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:08:00.156263,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/citation/,xwvgm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/597fv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/relationships/node/,597fv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4ed38633f0b9000dba4472/,5b4ed38633f0b9000dba4472,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xwvgm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xwvgm,NA

Even in the sophisticated variants of contextualization typical of the New Historicism, she explains, scholars' obsession with historical context as the ultimate source of textual meaning disregards the capacity of literature to resonate across time and space. ""Why is it,"" she writes, ""that we can feel solicited, button-holed, stirred up, by words that were drafted eons ago?"" (576). Felski is not the first to raise such objections. In an essay from 2001, Russell Berman takes a similar approach to the politics of periodization, pointing out how periodizing a work can serve to discipline it, that is to say, to deny its claim on the reader's present. For Berman, ""A literary-critical culture that values historical frames over 'artistic pleasure,' . . . tends to dismiss the diachronic moment in any reading, and with it the potential of tradition, the capacity precisely to transcend the constraints of the isolated historical moment."" Both Felski and Berman present powerful arguments against the fetishization of contemporaneity as the source of the truth of a work. In their focus on affect, however, they neglect a crucial facet of the transtemporal resonance they seek to underscore.  To limit oneself to the question of how and why literature can ""solicit,"" ""button-hole,"" and ""stir us up"" is to understate its role as both an instrument of cognition and a means of fostering particular cognitive capacities, or at least to sidestep the constitutive role of cognition in the experience of aesthetic pleasure.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:05:02.070134,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:04:41.733621,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/citation/,78zpu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4zhgr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/relationships/node/,4zhgr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e765833f0b9000cba1c05/,5b4e765833f0b9000cba1c05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/78zpu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/78zpu,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.014

We offer a methodology to identify and evaluate correlations between semantic and geographic distance in a printed corpus. Our work combines geographic information science (GIS) with corpus linguistics to study how places are described, how spatial categories coalesce and change, and how patterns in language correlate with patterns in geography. At its base, we'll argue, geospatial text analysis blends two key theoretical concepts. In GIS, the principle of ""spatial autocorrelation"" holds that nearby places tend to have similar characteristics at similar times. In computational semantics, the ""distributional hypothesis"" suggests that words with similar meanings tend to appear near each other in documents. Taken together, these hypotheses form a single idea: similar places at similar times tend to be described using similar words. To put this idea into action, we propose a data structure — the word-place matrix  —  that indexes a corpus to geographical features. Over a word-place matrix, measurements of word association are simultaneously measurements of spatial overlap. In just the same way that terms in a corpus can be gathered into conceptual groups, words in a word-place matrix can be associated with corresponding geographical regions. This very simple data format offers an easy-to-implement and theoretically well-grounded method for studying cultural topics with strong spatial components.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:05:28.101230,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:05:14.138708,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/citation/,85nfc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vhqrx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/relationships/node/,vhqrx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e71256d4eb300106e665b/,5b4e71256d4eb300106e665b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/85nfc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/85nfc,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.017

Ania Loomba has suggested that ""more than any other play of the time, Othello allows us to see that skin colour, religion, and location were often contradictorily yoked together within ideologies of 'race,' and that all these attributes were animated by notions of sexual and gender difference."" While some critics would moderate that view—pointing more or less toward religion, or gender, or geography—few would disagree about the basic ideology of race that Loomba identifies in the play and the early modern period. Daniel J. Vitkus, for example, focuses more on religious conversion than race, but still argues that ""cultural anxieties about 'turning Turk'"" were part of ""the fear of a black planet that gripped Europeans in the early modern era as they faced the expansion of Ottoman power."" Many others have agreed that the play ""repeats and reinforces the already established perception of Turks as the 'religious threat' and racial 'other.'"" A few, like Eric Griffin, have brought the focus on religion closer to home, reading the play as an expression of English nationalism during a time of tension with Catholic Spain, when anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish expression was its own form of othering ""ethnocentric discourse."" But even this broadened critical discussion is based on examination of a limited number of the texts published in early modern England, and it tells only a small part of the story of race in Othello. Digital approaches, however, open up a vast new body of texts for analysis, shifting the ground on which such criticism can take place.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T13:57:45.400291,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T13:57:21.393930,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/citation/,tg23u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/we5uh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/relationships/node/,we5uh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e6f426d4eb300126e5aa5/,5b4e6f426d4eb300126e5aa5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tg23u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tg23u,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.018

We have reached two conclusions, which may seem in tension with each other. The first is that gender divisions between characters have become less sharply marked over the last 170 years. In the middle of the nineteenth century, very different language is used to describe fictional men and women. But that difference weakens steadily as we move forward to the present; the actions and attributes of characters are less clearly sorted into gender categories. On the other hand, we haven't found the same progressive story in the history of authorship. In fact, there is an eye-opening, under-discussed decline in the proportion of fiction actually written by women, which drops by half (from roughly 50% of titles to roughly 25%) as we move from 1850 to 1950. The number of characters who are women or girls also drops. We are confronted with a paradoxical pattern. While gender roles were becoming more flexible, the space actually allotted to (real, and fictional) women on the shelves of libraries was contracting sharply. We explore the evidence for this paradox and suggest a few explanations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:04:25.346365,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:03:57.466420,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/citation/,fr9bk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w5vtp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/relationships/node/,w5vtp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e6cce6d4eb300126e590b/,5b4e6cce6d4eb300126e590b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fr9bk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fr9bk,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.019

One of the most powerful insights of reader-response theory in the 1970s and 1980s is that the meaning of a text never resides entirely within the artifact itself. Commentators from Carlo Ginzberg (""aggressive originality""), to Jauss (""horizon of expectations""), to Fish (""interpretive communities""), and Radway (""Reading is not Eating"") have long-since established that readers are creators of meaning. To quote Tony Bennett, meaning ""is not a thing that texts can have, but is something that can only be produced, and always differently, within the reading formations that regulate the encounters between texts and readers."" Yet even as it challenges the very idea that texts exist independently of readers and their institutional and social contexts, Bennett's concept of a ""reading formation"" also reminds us that there are socio-historically determined limits to creative appropriation. For Bennett, text, context, and reader constitute an inseparable unity; every reading situation is shaped by ""discursive and intertextual determinations that organize and animate the practice of reading. . . ."" A rich and nuanced account of the complex balance between social determination and autonomy therefore requires a combination of methods, both a consideration of textual features and investigation of book-historical, ideological, institutional, and social pressures.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:04:45.151215,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:04:16.947276,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/citation/,k29bw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/64c85/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/relationships/node/,64c85,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e656033f0b9000fba03aa/,5b4e656033f0b9000fba03aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k29bw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k29bw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k29bw,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.021

While social and institutional fields impose meaning structures, they are put to practice (emerge) in the context of specific activities that take place within a field. Collaborating in small groups, field participants form such practical contexts. It enables playing on gaps and overlaps among imposed meaning structures and joint creation of emergent meaning structures that define them as a social group. Difficult to capture, emergent meaning structures are largely disregarded by institutional and field perspectives on meaning structures. As a consequence, the importance of collective practice to meaning structures is underrated.
We investigate imposed and emergent meaning structures in artistic collectives. The field of contemporary art does not impose its meaning structure explicitly, so meaning structures that emerge in artistic practice are relatively free to vary across social groups. In particular, we study two St. Petersburg collectives of artists, who intensely interact with each other and engage in joint creative work and exhibitions. We show that these collectives elaborate their own meaning structures within the framework of field-specific meaning structures, blending meanings corresponding to the different fields and field positions occupied by members of the collective.
The duality of semantic and social structure is central to the notion of meaning structures. We use word collocations in natural language as semantic structure and interaction ties as social structure in a mixed methods socio-semantic network analysis. In this approach, social networks help to understand semantic networks.",TRUE,FALSE,art|field|interaction|meaning structure|mixed methods|practice,2018-07-18T17:06:07.063437,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-17T20:15:52.982665,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/citation/,42k3c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y64ra/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/relationships/node/,y64ra,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e48e1778458000d07b253/,5b4e48e1778458000d07b253,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42k3c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42k3c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42k3c,NA

In both cases, the literary-geographic imagination—or unconscious—of the period between 1880 and 1940 can help to shed light on how texts by British and British-aligned writers of the era understood these issues and how they evolved over time. At the highest level, how can we characterize the international and domestic geographies of British writing? What roles, if any, did cultural identity play in contemporary writers' spatial imagination? What locations were over- or under-represented in their work and how, if at all, does the answer change when we group writers by national origin or by perceived ethnicity? What shifts in geographic attention marked the transition from the late Victorian period to the interwar era of high modernism? These questions, and others like them, have received much recent attention, both popular and academic.
