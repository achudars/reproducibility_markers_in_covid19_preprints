Moore &amp; Robert E. Roth

HazMatMapper is an online and interactive geographic visualization tool designed to facilitate exploration of transnational flows of hazardous waste in North America (http://geography.wisc. edu/hazardouswaste/map/). While conventional narratives suggest that wealthier countries such as Canada and the United States (US) export waste to poorer countries like Mexico, little is known about how waste trading may affect specific sites within any of the three countries. To move beyond anecdotal discussions and national aggregates, we assembled a novel geographic dataset describing transnational hazardous waste shipments from 2007 to 2012 through two Freedom of Information Act requests for documents held by the US Environmental Protection Agency. While not yet detailing all of the transnational hazardous waste trade in North America, HazMatMapper supports multiscale and site-specific visual exploration of US imports of hazardous waste from Canada and Mexico. It thus enables academic researchers, waste regulators, and the general public to generate hypotheses on regional clustering, transnational corporate structuring, and environmental justice concerns, as well as to understand the limitations of existing regulatory data collection itself. Here, we discuss the dataset and design process behind HazMatMapper and demonstrate its utility for understanding the transnational hazardous waste trade.

Geographers of technology illustrate software code’s contexts, effects, and agencies as it shapes urban space and everyday life, but the consequences of code for nature remain understudied. Political ecologists have critiqued remote sensing and GIS-based conservation projects, but have not engaged more broadly with the role of software in the contested production, circulation, and application of ecological knowledge. Yet, around the world, data analytics firms and conservation nonprofits argue for optimizing environmental management through faster and bigger data collection and new techniques of data manipulation and visualization. I present a case study from the US state of Oregon illustrating how conservationists and environmental regulators employ computer programming to plan markets in which entrepreneurs restore stream and wetland ecosystem services to earn offset credits. In these markets, code-executed algorithms constituting spreadsheets, web maps, and GIS utilities generate, relate, and make sense of the data that defines credit commodities. I argue that code tends toward three effects: producing a landscape defined by wetlands' modeled value; performing social relations associated with nature’s neoliberalization and financialization; legitimating these moves. Although emphasis on the performativity of code and other technological objects is warranted, the contexts in which these are authored, deployed, and evaluated should remain central to understanding environmental governance. This is to caution against seeing technology as reducing nature and society to state or capitalist rationalities and to hesitate to differentiate prima facie code’s work on space and on nature. I call for bridging political ecology and geographies of technology in ways that can explain how code is generative of environmental knowledge, change, and conflict.

A central question for the transition in Estonia is whether wage differentials will begin to reflect real differences in human capital and sectorial shifts in production. Thus, wage determinants in Estonia are examined during the early stages of its transition toward a market economy. In addition, wage determinants are tested to determine if there are any differences between the state and non-state sectors as well as whether wages are higher in the non-state sector even after controlling for selection bias.

The findings are that while being male positively affects wages in both sectors, being Russian positively affects wages only in the private sector. Higher education has a greater positive impact on wages in the non-state sector. There is a positive return for working in the non-state sector, and it actually increases—from 20 to 28 percent—when controlling for selection.",TRUE,FALSE,economic transition|labor markets|private sector|Privatization|selection bias|wage determinants|wage differentials,2018-07-02T11:19:43.045663,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T16:56:05.039260,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d93|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/citation/,us4kb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h7q8c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/relationships/node/,h7q8c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f4b35f6c613b026d4fb384/,59f4b35f6c613b026d4fb384,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/us4kb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/us4kb/,https://doi.org/10.1080/15579336.1996.11770142,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/us4kb

This paper identifies functions of the quotative markers to and tte in spoken Japanese and examines the distinct distribution of each particle. The paper recognizes three related functions: marking direct or indirect quotation, marking evidentiality, and hedging. These uses are grouped together under the heading animating functions. In addition, the paper shows that to and tte display discrete distribution. Contrary to prior understanding, the particles are not identical in function.

Nilep, Chad. 2015. Ideologies of Language at Hippo Family Club. Pragmatics 25, 2: 205-227.

Ethnographic study of Hippo Family Club, a foreign language learning club in Japan with chapters elsewhere, reveals a critique of foreign language teaching in Japanese schools and in the commercial English conversation industry. Club members contrast their own learning methods, which they view as “natural language acquisition”, with the formal study of grammar, which they see as uninteresting and ineffective. Rather than evaluating either the Hippo approach to learning or the teaching methods they criticize, however, this paper considers the ways of thinking about language that club members come to share. Members view the club as a transnational organization that transcends the boundaries of the nation-state. Language learning connects the club members to a cosmopolitan world beyond the club, even before they interact with speakers of the languages they are learning. The analysis of club members’ ideologies of language and language learning illuminates not only the pragmatics of language use, but practices and outcomes of socialization and shared social structures.",TRUE,FALSE,education|Japan|language ideology|second language acquisition,2018-07-02T11:19:42.242134,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T00:42:19.086269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e05|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Semantics and Pragmatics",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/citation/,q6kz5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vx347/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/relationships/node/,vx347,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f3d0a39ad5a1026d10a432/,59f3d0a39ad5a1026d10a432,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q6kz5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q6kz5

This proposal is included in Article 13 — and accompanying Recitals — of the European Commission’s Draft Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market of September 14, 2016, which forms an important part of the ongoing EU copyright reform. This article highlights the shortcoming of this proposed reform, which might fall short in terms of clarity, consistency with the EU acquis, appropriacy and proportionality. In doing so, the article discusses recent CJEU case law — such as GSMedia, Ziggo and Filmspeler — struggling with the notion of communication to the public in the digital environment. It highlights systemic inconsistencies between the traditional knowledge-and-take-down negligence-based intermediary liability system and the introduction of filtering and monitoring obligations. The article examines the appropriacy of filtering — and monitoring — measures within a fundamental rights perspective by considering proportionality between property rights’ enforcement and competing fundamental rights — such as freedom of expression, freedom of business and privacy.

But northern Nigeria has undergone significant socio political changes since those theories were applied and there has been little effort to define class in contemporary Northern Nigerian society. This paper presents the findings of the largest quantitative investigation into class distinction in Northern Nigeria.

Decisions based on algorithmic, machine learning models can be unfair, reproducing biases in historical data used to train them. While computational techniques are emerging to address aspects of these concerns through communities such as discrimination-aware data mining (DADM) and fair, accountable and transparent machine learning (FATML), their practical implementation faces real-world challenges. For legal, institutional or commercial reasons, organisations might not hold the data on sensitive attributes such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability needed to diagnose and mitigate emergent indirect discrimination-by-proxy, such as redlining. Such organisations might also lack the knowledge and capacity to identify and manage fairness issues that are emergent properties of complex sociotechnical systems.

This paper presents and discusses three potential approaches to deal with such knowledge and information deficits in the context of fairer machine learning. Trusted third parties could selectively store data necessary for performing discrimination discovery and incorporating fairness constraints into model-building in a privacy-preserving manner. Collaborative online platforms would allow diverse organisations to record, share and access contextual and experiential knowledge to promote fairness in machine learning systems. Finally, unsupervised learning and pedagogically interpretable algorithms might allow fairness hypotheses to be built for further selective testing and exploration.

Real-world fairness challenges in machine learning are not abstract, constrained optimisation problems, but are institutionally and contextually grounded. Computational fairness tools are useful, but must be researched and developed in and with the messy contexts that will shape their deployment, rather than just for imagined situations. Not doing so risks real, near-term algorithmic harm.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithmic accountability|algorithmic bias|algorithmic fairness|algorithmic transparency|algorithm studies|anti-discrimination law|computing and society|critical algorithm studies|data protection law|discrimination-aware data mining|fair machine learning|gdpr|machine learning|protected characteristics,2018-07-02T11:19:41.971251,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-27T15:53:35.289463,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/citation/,ustxg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/up6q4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/relationships/node/,up6q4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f3559c9ad5a1026d107902/,59f3559c9ad5a1026d107902,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ustxg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ustxg/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951717743530,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ustxg

The Japanese particle 'to' serves as a quotative marker, either indicating the content of quoted speech or thought, or serving related functions. The particle 'tte' is frequently identified as an informal variant of 'to', serving identical or nearly identical functions in casual speech. Analysis of a collection of 129 informal conversations shows a clear but non-categorical tendency for the particle 'tte' to appear with verbs of speech, or at the ends of utterances with no following verb, and for the particle 'to' to appear with verbs of cognition.

This chapter discusses a plan to relocate US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, and focuses particularly on charges that former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama failed to deliver on a promise to remove the base from Okinawa in 2010. The promise of action came not from any particular speech by Mr. Hatoyama, but was an interdiscursive achievement involving many individuals.
