These models are commonly defined as planar, meaning they can be represented in two dimensions without any underpasses or overpasses. However, real-world urban street networks exist in three-dimensional space and frequently feature grade separation such as bridges and tunnels: planar simplifications can be useful but they also impact the results of real-world street network analysis. This study measures the nonplanarity of drivable and walkable street networks in the centers of 50 cities worldwide, then examines the variation of nonplanarity across a single city. It develops two new indicators - the Spatial Planarity Ratio and the Edge Length Ratio - to measure planarity and describe infrastructure and urbanization. While some street networks are approximately planar, we empirically quantify how planar models can inconsistently but drastically misrepresent intersection density, street lengths, routing, and connectivity.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|geospatial|GIS|graph theory|modeling|network analysis|network science|nonplanar|planarity|routing|simulation|street network|traffic|transportation|urban design|urban fabric|urban form|urban morphology|urban planning|urban studies,2018-07-02T11:54:45.711563,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-05T21:54:28.714576,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/citation/,hma8y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3zqat/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/relationships/node/,3zqat,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b16c3c4a291c400103aad86/,5b16c3c4a291c400103aad86,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hma8y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hma8y/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808318802941,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hma8y

The author argues that recent translation technology is in dialectic with current developments in translation theory, approaches which displace the notion of meaning in translation away from the idea of equivalence.

Phillips, the Kittitian-British author, interweaves a variety of narrative voices of both black and white characters in an attempt to provide a thorough scrutiny and a deep diagnosis of a traumatic past that contains the underlining fundaments of present racial issues and identity dilemmas that black communities suffer from in both the United States and Britain. This study is primarily focused on deconstructing and reconstructing Phillips’s portrayal of what he calls “the shameful intercourse” between the slave trader and the African father.

Notwithstanding the pitfalls of translation between English and Arabic in general, translating legal texts poses certain challenges of critical implications. Such challenges can be attributed to the difference in the structure of the legal texts, types of legal texts, and, most importantly, the difference in the legal system between the Arab countries on the one hand and the English-speaking countries on the other.

Recently, however, many researchers (Witte, Harden &amp; Ramos de Oliveira Harden, 2009; Cook, 2010; Leonardi, 2010; Malmkjaer, 2010) have questioned the outright dismissal of translation from the foreign language classroom and called for reassessing its role. Moreover, they welcomed it as a fifth skill alongside reading, writing, listening, and speaking that learners need in their learning and future careers. This paper argues for the rehabilitation of translation in the teaching and learning of foreign languages. It attempts to give a panorama of the revival of translation. So, it first reconsiders its dismissal in the method era and then it summarises the literature on its revival in the 21st century. The review of literature has revealed that the onslaught against translation was illegitimate and that the literature in favour of it is a reputable, a recent, and an abundant one.",TRUE,FALSE,fifth skill|foreign language classroom|the revival|translation,2018-07-02T11:54:44.659890,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-06T11:45:36.981084,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/citation/,u3zrq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q9zv8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/relationships/node/,q9zv8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b160266a291c400103a197a/,5b160266a291c400103a197a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u3zrq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u3zrq

Recently, some members of academia have argued that no methodology exists to study excess deaths attributable to climate disasters. This study uses death records for Puerto Rico between 1990 and 1998 to assess excess deaths following Hurricane Georges by comparing death counts for 1998 with patterns of variation from the previous eight years. Because no population shift occurred in that decade, other than expected ones based on historical information, the average number of deaths is indicative of expected deaths and the confidence intervals are the ranges of accepted variation. If a count following a climate disaster exceeds the upper limit of the confidence interval these deaths could be considered above the historical ranges of variation and this excess could be associated with the climate disaster of interest. Death counts for September-November 1998 indicate that 819 deaths were in excess of historical ranges of variation. When the year in which Hurricane Hortense is excluded from the construction of the ranges of variation, the excess is 945 deaths. A total of 811 or 937 are missing in comparison to the official death count for this Hurricane. Considering that death counts data structures are comparable across the countries of the world, this method can be used to analyze the effect of other climate disasters.",TRUE,FALSE,Excess Deaths|Hurricane Georges|Mortality|Official Statistics|Puerto Rico|Statistical Methods,2018-07-02T11:54:44.470236,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-05T00:44:10.676355,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Alexis R.

Regarding comparisons, there are two different objectives: they may be known and unknown in the target language. The objectives become a translation problem according to different languages, cultures, attitudes and other aspects. This study aimed to investigate the translation techniques used for transferring live metaphors found in a novel into Thai, namely, Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2005) and its translated version. The translation strategies were studied and analyzed. The analysis relied on the model of Newmark (1988) which proposed seven techniques for metaphor translation. The results of this research showed that the most frequently technique employed was the source metaphor that can be reproduced as the same image in target language, with a total of fifty-seven sentences out of one hundred thirty-six sentences. Additionally, there were also three techniques that were often applied: the metaphor can be translated as a simile by adding some meaning or translating a metaphor as a metaphor and plus some meaning or explanation and the metaphor can be deleted when it is redundant. It can be inferred that to maintain the native sense of language and prevent reader’s confusion, the translator provided the equivalent or same image in the target language. Therefore, the author avoided deleting the source image and instead converted it to literal language.",TRUE,FALSE,live metaphor|metaphor|source language|source text|target text|translation|translation strategy,2018-07-02T11:54:44.339769,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:36:42.403574,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/citation/,b6mv8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/684mp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/relationships/node/,684mp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b157d3af1f288000d65fe11/,5b157d3af1f288000d65fe11,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b6mv8/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b6mv8

This study tries to prove the capability and manageability in collaboration not only in ordinary prose drama but also in poetic plays. It aims to trace, through an analytical and critical technique, the procedures of collaboration showing, to what degree both of the two collaborators, Auden and Isherwood, achieved success in dealing with contemporary poetic drama using modern language. The research is an approach on one of the likely best plays they shared, The Ascent of F6 (1933). The study starts giving a glance on poetic drama then it traces the collaboration between W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood with special reference to the poetic play The Ascent of F6.",TRUE,FALSE,Auden and Isherwood|collaboration|plays|poetic drama|twentieth century,2018-07-02T11:54:44.308005,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:36:20.265545,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/citation/,hqubn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ktaq3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/relationships/node/,ktaq3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b157b5ff1f2880010643492/,5b157b5ff1f2880010643492,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqubn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hqubn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hqubn

This type of fiction also has a hero who is usually a ranger or cowboy. This study aims to find a Western fiction formula and look for new things that may appear in the novel Touch of Texas as a Western novel. Taking the original convention of Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales, this study also looks for the invention and convention of Touch of Texas by using Cawelti’s formula theory. The study finds that Garrett's Touch of Texas not only features a natural malignancy against civilization, a ranger as a single hero, and a love story, but also shows an element of revenge and the other side of a neglected minority life. A hero or ranger in this story comes from a minority group, a mixture of white blood and Indians. The romance story also shows a different side. The woman in the novel is not the only one to be saved, but a Ranger is too, especially from the wounds and ridicule of the population as a ranger of mixed blood. The story ends with a romantic tale between Jake and Rachel. Further research can be done to find the development of western genre with other genres such as detective and mystery.",TRUE,FALSE,fiction|formula|frontier|Western fiction|wilderness,2018-07-02T11:54:44.273846,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:36:03.341359,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/citation/,3x2cu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tzq4f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/relationships/node/,tzq4f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b15794964f25a000f77010c/,5b15794964f25a000f77010c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3x2cu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3x2cu/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3x2cu
