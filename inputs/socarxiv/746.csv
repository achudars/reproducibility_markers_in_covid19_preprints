The paper explores how colonial inheritances, assimilationist ideology and the emergence of an archipelagic nationalism included and excluded Chinese foodways in New Order era embargoes on and erasures of Chinese cultural expression. By looking at the way food was and was not included in the bans on public performances of Chinese culture, I explore how Chinese-Indonesian culture was constructed, produced, and framed in the New Order era in light of the culture bans. I do this by first looking for the historical roots of New Order nationalism and assimilation and seeking to understand how these relations of power informed what was considered Indonesian and what was considered Chinese. I then look at how the Chinese origin of Indonesian food culture was erased from collective memory by these processes. I propose that an archipelagic nationalism was produced in Indonesia through a claim to “unity in diversity” which relied on the exclusion of groups within Indonesia’s boundaries from that unification.

These groups afforded opportunities for Indonesian Facebook users participating in local activism online to join a globalizing Occupy movement within a familiar online activism framework. Despite a history of colonial occupation, Indonesian cyberactivists embraced expanded meanings of the word occupy as they joined a global social movement and formed local Occupy networks. During two years of multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork online and in Indonesia, this research explored what constitutes “occupation” for online participants in the Indonesian Occupy movement, and what it means for activists to “occupy” in (post)colonial Indonesia.

Active-control data showed that occasional apparent effects of praise for hard work on easy outcome measures reflected motivational confounds rather than effects of implicit beliefs about the malleability of intelligence (study 3, active control condition). Children’s own mindsets showed no relationship to IQ, school grades, or change in grades across the school year, with the only significant result being in the reverse direction to prediction (better performance in children holding a fixed mindset).

(1) Ethnic/racial groups are constructed in political processes that are tied to state formation and social movements. Many states (including the United States) have an ethnic/racial bias or footprint in their construction. Ethnic/racial groups that are numerical majorities have an advantage in determining state policies and state actions that advantage dominant groups over subordinate groups, create chains of interrelations that amplify differences in power and privilege, and take actions to prohibit or prevent reparations or redress for these past actions. (2) Network isolation and intergenerational transmission interact with structures of domination to reproduce domination over time. “Ethnicity” matters when ethnic boundaries are relatively sharp, consequential, and highly correlated with domination structures and social networks. Strong “ethnic” boundaries tend to divide societies into majorities and minorities. (3) Dominant groups develop and reproduce cultures of domination that include both hostile and benign paternalistic relations with other groups. Subordinate groups develop and reproduce cultures that intermingle opposition and submission. Collective identities are both imposed from without by the actions of others and asserted from within. Identities and cultural practices are developed collectively within social networks and influenced by the actions and speech of political actors, including social movements. (4) Regardless of whether their goals are group-oriented or issue-oriented, all movements in an ethnically-divided or ethnically-hierarchical society have an “ethnic” dimension in the sense that they draw from or map onto one or more ethnic groups. Movements arising from privileged “ethnic” majorities have different dynamics from movements by disadvantaged “ethnic” minorities or mixed-ethnic movements. 

Processes of group formation derived from theories of the social construction of ethnicity illuminate other movement-relevant group formation processes, including class formation and political subcultures. Lying at the intersection of the sociology of social movements and the sociology of race and ethnicity, the “ethnic” dimensions are revealed as a lens for understanding the general problems of group and identity formation and collective mobilization that lie at the heart of both areas.

An ethnographic approach permits us to investigate the fine-grained human interactions around one such potentially problematic instance. Participatory observation and in-depth interviewing of board members and staff from a New York City community board in a low-income neighborhood show that they can partially overcome the challenge of expertise by developing their own technical capacity.
