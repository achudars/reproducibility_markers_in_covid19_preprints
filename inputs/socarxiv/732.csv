In its recent Myriad Genetics decision, the United States Supreme Court is curiously silent about the relationship between its holding in that case and the holding in its immediately previous patent subject matter case, Mayo v. Prometheus. This reticence is all the more puzzling given that the Court initially remanded Myriad to the lower courts for reconsideration in light of the Mayo holding. The Court's silence regarding Mayo leaves uncertain the relationship between the ""products of nature"" doctrine that serves as the basis for the Myriad decision, and the ""laws of nature"" doctrine that has been the basis of nearly all of its other subject matter cases.

My vehicle for examining such effects is the testing service for genetic predisposition to cancer which was the subject of the recent Supreme Court decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v.

While an obituary for the incentive theory of patenting is likely premature, the concept that the patent system is based upon myth should not be surprising. Over the past 30 years, some of the most prominent work in sociology has focused on social ordering, including legal ordering, that is found to be structured around prevalent social narratives or myths. Explicitly rejecting the economic construct of rational behavior, such ""new institutional"" approaches to social ordering recognize that organizations adopt practices and structures according to widely recognized scripts or conventions that lend legitimacy to their goals. In this essay I suggest that the known behavior of patenting firms likely fits the models developed in new institutional sociology: firms patent because other firms patent, because investors expect them to patent, and because patents validate the firm as innovative and reputable. Following such conventions is socially rational, but not necessarily economically rational. Applying new institutional approaches to patenting could explain several pervasive yet puzzling behaviors within the patent system, and moves us away from interminable fruitless arguments over the idealized efficiency or inefficiency of patents.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:49.790658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T22:02:18.955000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/citation/,q8k6n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vv6qa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/relationships/node/,vv6qa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57895d6cb83f6901f3c0634e/,57895d6cb83f6901f3c0634e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8k6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q8k6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q8k6n

With few exceptions, Durkheim assumed that criminal punishment is done on behalf of society. With the rise of prison privatization, this assumption is increasingly called into question. For-profit firms carrying out punishment, though legally agents of the state, are motivated by private gain. This article asks: How might privatization modify the functional effects of punishment?  It develops answers to this question by using insights from Durkheimian and neo-Durkheimian scholarship and the empirical case of modern privatized punishment in the United States. The article proposes three trajectories through which privatized punishment may (or may not) affect solidarity: Parity in Punishment, in which private and public punishers are seen as interchangeable; Public Interest, in which perceptions of greed and self-interest mar privatized punishment and sap it of its functional effects; and Sacred Transgressions, in which the private sector encroaches on sacred rites of punishment to the detriment of solidarity.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Durkheim|Preprint|privatization|punishment|socarxiv|theory,2018-07-02T10:51:02.527153,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T21:35:56.034000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/citation/,hd4zu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nr3c7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/relationships/node/,nr3c7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5789573d9ad5a101f2f5c399/,5789573d9ad5a101f2f5c399,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hd4zu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hd4zu

Most discussions on the orphan works problem focus on the demand side: on users’ inability to locate owners. However, looking also at the supply side reveals that the problem of orphan works arises not only because users find it prohibitively costly to locate owners, but also because under a strict permission-first rule, copyright owners, who do not internalize the full social cost of forgone uses, face suboptimal incentives to maintain themselves locatable. However, in many cases copyright owners are usually the least-cost avoiders of the orphan works problem, and like in many other areas of law, should be encouraged to take steps to reduce the extent of the problem. Building on this insight, the article shows how considering the locatability of the owner of an infringed work at the remedy stage and tweaking the appropriate remedy will encourage owners to remain locatable, and why this solution is preferable to other proposed solutions. The article also discusses the tendency to treat the requirement to seek permission before using as a dogma, and why this dogmatic view of copyright impedes simple and efficient solutions and leads to adoption of grand solutions that are ineffective at best and harmful at worst.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:08.443842,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T20:50:03.596000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/citation/,fvgsd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gd56w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/relationships/node/,gd56w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57894c7d6c613b01f4347cf5/,57894c7d6c613b01f4347cf5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fvgsd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fvgsd
