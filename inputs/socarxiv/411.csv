Most of the descriptive work on data fraud is concerned with diagnosing the causes of fraudulent and deceptive research practices or with measuring their extent, while on the normative side, most calls for reform in academic publishing rely largely on more rigorous data policies and renewed calls for observational awareness. Alas, it remains to be seen whether such methods of self-regulation will be effective at reducing the incidence of research fraud. This paper thus proposes a different approach to data fraud, one that is more likely to reduce the incidence of data fabrication. Specifically, I propose that alleged serial academic fraudsters like James Hunton be charged with criminal wire fraud. My previous work in this domain explored the possibility of imposing civil liability for data fraud committed by academic researchers. This paper, by contrast, will explore the possibility of criminal liability when an author knowingly fabricates data in his research.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Fraud|Data Fabrication|Hunton|Wire Fraud,2019-07-31T21:00:02.778763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T20:59:40.530279,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/citation/,ubx7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d41bc2c26ebf5001b865094/,5d41bc2c26ebf5001b865094,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ubx7g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ubx7g,NA

I argue that rural natural resource dependence represents a special case of the core periphery relationship, where rural, resource rich labor markets form a dual dependency on both the global capitalist economy and the local natural environment. This occurs because the contradiction between spatially fixed natural resources and the mobility of capital prompts both external interests and local power elites to use their power to pressure rural labor markets in directions outside their best interest and to exploit rural labor. I argue that both extractive (e.g. mining, timber, agriculture) and non extractive (e. tourism, real estate) forms of natural resource development share this contradiction.

These changes impact on the management and regulation of future energy systems and question how they will support a socially equitable, acceptable, net-zero transition. This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies, business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and optimisation (e.g. automated network management), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways. Through this they are expected to deliver on a wide range of outcomes, both within the SLES boundary and to the wider system. However, there may be trade-offs between outcomes due to pressures for change originating from competing actors (e.g. landscape vs. incumbents in the regime); understanding the mapping between different outcomes, SLES elements and their interconnections will be key to unlocking wider benefits.",TRUE,FALSE,Community energy|Decentralized energy|Energy democratization|Energy transition|Expert interviews|Meta-narrative review|Smart cities|Smart local energy systems,2019-07-31T21:00:41.857373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T21:00:28.169661,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/citation/,j4d57,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/82dnf/,82dnf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d419d233ce9350019ec2a00/,5d419d233ce9350019ec2a00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j4d57/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j4d57,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120612

Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without ""ground truth"" information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National Information Service's (NIS) disinformation campaign during the presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of campaign accounts published in court proceedings. Features that best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory.",TRUE,FALSE,Astroturfing|Disinformation|Election campaign|Propaganda|Social media,2019-07-31T12:21:23.411277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T12:20:57.049881,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/citation/,a5gk6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpa6u/,tpa6u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3f6a3f596eee001d653479/,5d3f6a3f596eee001d653479,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a5gk6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a5gk6,NA

Moreover, recent literature finds that exposure to one event tends to increase risk of the other. However, next to nothing is known about the size or composition – or changes therein – of the divorced/separated and unemployed (DSU) subpopulation. Using large, nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional datasets extending back to 1984, we aim to fill this gap for the UK. We give a descriptive account of the prevalence and social distribution of DSU, and of the cross-sectional association between its two component states: among which groups, by education and gender, does being either divorced/separated or unemployed most strongly imply a heightened risk of also being the other, and how has this changed over time? We find stable and strong educational inequality in DSU, while the gender gap has narrowed and recently closed. The association between the two states is stronger among men; has weakened strikingly over the time period we consider, for both men and, especially, women; and is educationally stratified among men but not women. Contrary to expectations, higher-educated men in one of the two states are most likely to also be in the other. Possible explanations and further questions are discussed. In particular, we highlight the possibility that over this time period the divorced/separated have become more like the general population, rather than a negatively selected subgroup among whom unemployment is a particular risk.",TRUE,FALSE,cumulative disadvantage|divorced|job loss|marital dissolution|repartnering|unemployed,2019-07-29T12:35:25.905922,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-29T12:35:02.600588,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/citation/,yj6t4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pyc76/,pyc76,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3ece4a596eee001d64998a/,5d3ece4a596eee001d64998a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yj6t4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yj6t4,NA

On the one hand, biocitizenship entails the positive, active efforts of human beings demanding their rights to health and well-being. On the other hand, biocitizenship is also understood as an extension of ‘biopolitics’ in the Foucauldian sense, so that biocitizenship disciplines and controls subjects even as it affords them certain rights. While this duality and its various complexities have generated a sizeable body of literature, there has to date been no edited volume on the subject of biocitizenship. Johnson, Happe, and Levina helpfully fill this gap, bringing together disparate voices from various disciplines into a volume that is provocative and insightful.",TRUE,FALSE,biocitizenship|biomedicine|biopolitics|citzenship|medicalization,2019-07-28T12:03:45.307076,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-28T12:03:33.109697,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment",Andrew J.

Why should I care about care?” This question, raised by one of María Puig de la Bellacasa’s colleagues, is one that could be reasonably posed by any critical scholar. Care is, after all, a deeply fraught concept. Historically, the ideal of caretaking has been used to justify women’s domestic confinement and their lack of remuneration. More recently, it’s been coopted by corporations in their altruistic marketing strategies (think “CBS Cares” or “Chase Cares” or “Nordstrom Cares”). Taking seriously care’s ambivalent, non-innocent character, Matters of Care offers a praiseworthy posthumanist intervention into the politics of caring, working to recuperate care from the trappings of neoliberal biopolitics.",TRUE,FALSE,care|ethics|feminism|posthumanism|STS,2019-07-28T12:03:24.860310,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-28T12:02:57.513068,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment",Andrew J.

In “The Elementary Forms of Religious Life,” Durkheim studied Aboriginal Australian religion in an effort to better understand humanity as a whole. In doing so, he introduced a variety of concepts and terms that to many of today’s readers could be considered rather confusing. This project works to make tangible and relatable the implications behind the esoteric Aboriginal Australian terminology used by Durkheim. It does so by relating vocabulary and themes contained within the text to the galaxy far, far away of Star Wars. Several key examples of this application and relation to Star Wars include relating Durkheim’s totemic force to The Force in Star Wars, connecting the concept of a churinga to the lightsaber, and examining Durkheim’s division between religion and magic by looking at the Jedi and Sith. This project then, utilizes fandom to bridge the gap between a classic sociological text and the pop culture phenomenon of Star Wars.",TRUE,FALSE,Durkheim|Religion|Star Wars,2019-07-27T23:29:45.815512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-27T23:29:21.268866,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/citation/,a48ev,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3prgz/,3prgz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3ccbc8596eee002062ba0a/,5d3ccbc8596eee002062ba0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a48ev/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a48ev,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NJQHS
