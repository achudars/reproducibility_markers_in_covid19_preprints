Gaining insight into citation practices in HCI can enrich our understanding of the structure of research, as well as social and political factors that influence knowledge production. Recent research into HCI citation practices have identified problematic trends: inaccurate citing and a lack of critical citations. Directly investigating authors' motivations for citing can provide a fuller picture of citation practices. It can help us understand HCI research as a social system and develop a theory of citing. We report an interview study designed to identify authors' motivations to cite. We found three primary motivations: affirming personal relationships, building intellectual narratives, and serving strategic objectives. We discuss our findings from a social constructivist perspective of citation practices. In addition, we explore how these findings can strengthen efforts to write CHI papers.

Unlike in traditional offshore outsourcing, service providers are predominantly one-person microproviders located in emerging-economy countries not necessarily associated with offshoring and often disadvantaged by negative country images. How do these microproviders survive and thrive? We theorize global platforms through transaction cost economics (TCE), arguing that they are a new technology-enabled offshoring institution that emerges in response to cross-border information asymmetries that hitherto prevented microproviders from participating in offshoring markets. To explain how platforms achieve this, we adapt signaling theory to a TCE-based model and test our hypotheses by analyzing 6 months of transaction records from a leading platform. To help interpret the results and generalize them beyond a single platform, we introduce supplementary data from 107 face-to-face interviews with microproviders in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals choose microprovidership when it provides a better return on their skills and labor than employment at a local (offshoring) firm. The platform acts as a signaling environment that allows microproviders to inform foreign clients of their quality, with platform-generated signals being the most informative signaling type. Platform signaling disproportionately benefits emerging-economy providers, allowing them to partly overcome the effects of negative country images and thus diminishing the importance of home country institutions.

Drawing upon research related to listening practices, this study operationalizes for empirical study Dobson’s (2014) normative concepts of apophatic listening, which is dialogic and facilitates discussion across lines of difference, and cataphatic listening, which is monologic and disruptive in nature. Using data from a national sample survey of Latinos fielded shortly after the 2016 U.S. presidential election (N = 720), we provide an empirical test of these listening practices’ democratic value by examining how relational and analytical listening (dimensions of apophatic practices) and task-oriented and critical listening (dimensions of cataphatic practices) are associated with various political outcomes, including political interest, knowledge, trust, and participation. Findings indicate that, from a normative point of view, task-oriented listening was unrelated or negatively related to political outcomes while relational listening had ambivalent relations. However, the two cognitive-epistemic dimensions of both types of listening – analytical listening and critical (error-seeking) listening – were both strongly and positively related to most studied political outcomes. These findings offer nuanced evidence that apophatic and cataphatic listening might not necessarily be at odds with each other where democratically desirable outcomes are concerned.",TRUE,FALSE,deliberation|democratic theory|listening|normative analysis|political behavior|political communication|political psychology|political talk,2018-11-02T11:24:04.887222,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-02T11:23:42.064167,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/citation/,rghk2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/aqk6d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/relationships/node/,aqk6d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdc32159764d200195ae971/,5bdc32159764d200195ae971,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rghk2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rghk2,NA

Global or world literature then entails a literature that does not abide by the rigidity of the borders, which imprison texts within the local confinements of national identity traits. It is rather a process which allows the circulation of texts across national borders for the purpose of forming one huge hybrid culture that mixes various literary flavors. In an era of globalization and while the very notion of Western canon seems obsolete and out dated, there still exists some sort of discrimination among the texts allowed to enter the global literary canon.  Some literary texts are considered not exotic enough or too exotic to meet the expectations of a wide and translational readership. For that reason, a great number of texts is deliberately marginalized and dropped from the canon confirming then the Western monopole operating upon the marketing and publishing houses. In this view of things, the present paper addresses the particular status of the Algerian literature in French within the global literary canon.

In the light of this statement this research article investigates following main questions. 1-What are those signs and practices which constitute colonial discourse? 2- How do they signify according to semiotic theory? This article is a philosophical endeavour to develop conclusive argument to determine the psycho-semiotic nature of those meaning making practices which form the very basis of the colonial discourse. The aim of this study is to establish a triangular link of the sign theory, psychological conditioning and colonial discourse. Fairclough’s (1995) triadic model of Critical Discourse Analysis has been used to analyse various linguistic practices of colonisers at Description—Interpretation—Explanation levels.  After exemplifying from various texts, the study concludes that colonial signs are psychologically conditioned, discursively conventionalised and socially upheld linguistic practices which disseminate ideas they stand for. Hence, colonialism is not only a historical fact but also a linguistically and semiotically crafted phenomenon. The article lays down a vivid criterion which can serve for further analytical studies in the domain of colonial and post-colonial discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,colonial discourse|post-colonial discourse|psychology|semiotics|sign theory,2019-07-25T18:41:41.809160,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:41:24.408013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/citation/,7b3yg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8g9v2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/relationships/node/,8g9v2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbc986a28e68001ba44ef6/,5bdbc986a28e68001ba44ef6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b3yg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7b3yg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7b3yg,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.13

The aim of this paper is to examine how Saudi women short story writers used a western literary form to depict the realities of their country. It also delineates the magnificent representation of social themes through storytelling  and provides  non-Arabic speakers with an insight into the writings of Saudi female writers. It tries to present a vivid picture of how these stories reflect the social reality in Saudi Arabia in the last few decades of the 20th century and the challenges facing women in this transitional period. Moreover, the study tries to examine how women writers participated in the contentious debates regarding women that dominated the Saudi society especially on questions like marriage, divorce and women education. The present study is basically a text-based research that involves an analysis of major primary sources chosen. Selected short stories written by Saudi women writers  are examined from a thematic perspective to reveal the ways in which women writers incited social change by defining notions of gender and social space and how they give voice to the Saudi women.",TRUE,FALSE,Gender|Saudi women writers|short story|social themes,2019-07-25T18:40:04.104642,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:39:47.155508,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/citation/,enyf6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2g5qh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/relationships/node/,2g5qh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbc839a28e68001aa2a564/,5bdbc839a28e68001aa2a564,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/enyf6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/enyf6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/enyf6,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.11

To prove this, a cognitive approach to metaphorical expressions translation in political discourse is used. The study focuses on the analysis of the conceptual mapping of the abstract concept of politics into some other source domains. The given examples are used to argue that we use existing physical concepts to conceptualize abstract concepts for easy understanding. The results obtained reveal that the set of conceptual metaphors underlying the political expressions are almost similar in both languages in terms of the source domains used as well as their collocation patterns. The paper adds a further support to the claim that metaphors are not only a rhetorical tool used by literary men but it reflects our thinking when dealing with abstract issues in terms of concrete experience. The study has pedagogical implications for media translation students. They can compile their own glossaries using the collocation patterns relevant to each metaphorical expression.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive concepts|collocation|domain|mapping|metaphor|political,2019-07-25T18:39:21.939194,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:39:04.938538,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/citation/,8y3q5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/njtpz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/relationships/node/,njtpz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbc7969764d200195a3d85/,5bdbc7969764d200195a3d85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8y3q5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8y3q5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8y3q5,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.10
