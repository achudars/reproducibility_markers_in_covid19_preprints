The study concluded that almost all studies used qualitative research method for instance semi-structured interview. Some of studies combined both survey and interview to collect data for research. Moreover, the results of this study conceptualized “tourism stakeholders who are persons relating to tourism development in destinations”. Criteria to include tourism stakeholders in their study based on many aspects such as literature review, related documents of destinations, local sources, tourism stakeholder’s knowledge and experiences.

Robot scientists do not supply definite answers to the discussed questions, but rather provide ""proofs of concept"" for various ideas. For example, it is not that robot scientists solve the realist/antirealist philosophical debate, but that when working with robot scientists one has to make a philosophical choice - in this case, to assume a realist view of science. There are still few systems for autonomous scientific discovery in existence, and it is too early to generalize and propose new theories. However, being ""in the midst of ... a revolution"" it is important for the research community to re-examine views pertinent to scientific discovery.

To address this question, we revise empirical models examining environmental activism by disaggregating the outcome variable of movement participation and dichotomizing two key motivational factors. Using repeated cross-sectional data from the US General Social Survey of 2000 and 2010, this study conducts logistic regression of four forms of participation on perceived severity and sense of efficacy, while accounting for biographical availability and political engagement. Results from regression analysis show that vocabularies of motive have substantial impacts on an individual’s likelihood of: 1) signing a petition; 2) giving money; 3) joining a group; and 4) joining a protest or demonstration. Their effects are large enough to override the noticeable impacts of liberalism and education. This study also finds that the level of participation in the movement across all forms has decreased between 2000 and 2010.  These findings direct our attention to the limited capacity of the public sphere to accommodate the environmental movement during the last decade, as well as to potential changes in environmental activism in the coming decades that may mobilize those previously less likely to participate.",TRUE,FALSE,education|environmental movement|liberalism|movement participation|vocabularies of motive,2018-07-02T11:48:45.896170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-20T15:46:38.027817,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/citation/,hetzb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96xdp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/relationships/node/,96xdp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad9f6bd144be4001179bb15/,5ad9f6bd144be4001179bb15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hetzb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hetzb,https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2017.1331121

Scholars are beginning to develop models to explain LGBT inclusion in schools, but they have undertheorized the role of religion in facilitating or impeding LGBT inclusion. In this article, I draw from the literature on religion and the “culture wars,” especially insights into religions’ theological orientations, to explain Christian colleges and universities’ inclusion of LGBT students. I show that communal orientations—theological emphases on social justice—strongly predict the adoption of LGBT groups and inclusive nondiscrimination policies at Christian colleges and universities. By contrast, individualist orientations—theological emphases on personal piety—impede the adoption of such groups and policies. Importantly, I find little support for alternative explanations of Christian colleges and universities’ inclusion of LGBT students that focus on liberal or conservative teachings on same-sex relationships.

It does this through a case study of the career of the metaphor of weaponization that became ubiquitous around the United States’ 2016 presidential election. As a concept, the word originated in the Cold War defense industry as a literal description of the logistical deployment of weapons systems. As its use mutated into a metaphor between 1999-2003, it took on its contemporary moral meaning of over-politicizing things that had been, and should remain, neutral or peaceful. By 2017 “the weaponization of everything” implied that all aspects of social life were newly embroiled in illegitimate politics, making the metaphor a profound act of nostalgia that erased even recent conflicts. Weaponization demonstrates that a metaphor can retain its meaningfulness when it becomes ubiquitous by marshalling a temporal narrative tension against widely shared perceptions of recent social change. This is surprising because contemporary metaphor theory implies that ubiquitous metaphors become mere descriptions or concepts if they are not used in different ways that are embedded in competing discursive communities. Because metaphors derive their meaningfulness through tension, weaponiz- shows how temporality, or social time, can be marshalled to attempt to create a shared public that understands itself as deeply divided. Weaponization is thus instructive as an act of folk sociology that exposes as social and conflicted, things that were previously natural or innocuous. Weaponization indicates a yearning for a shared polity in divided times, and shows that political metaphors can create broad publics that share the same meaning for all sides among competing political groups, even if that meaning is a naïve or utopian rejection of politics altogether.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 presidential election|conceptual metaphor theory|cultural anxiety|cultural politics|metaphor|New York Times|social time|temporality|weaponization,2018-07-02T11:48:43.359055,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-19T15:43:54.335419,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/citation/,sur6e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5efrw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/relationships/node/,5efrw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad86121694cf90011f2e8d3/,5ad86121694cf90011f2e8d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sur6e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sur6e,NA

We incorporate both unmarried sex ratios and the economic status of unmarried men within each racial group, using multilevel logistic models. We find higher marriage odds in markets with more (same-race) unmarried men, holding constant women’s own characteristics. In addition, for White women only, local men’s education and employment rates also predict higher odds of women’s first marriage. The findings imply that if White and Black women experienced similar unmarried sex ratios in their local markets, the gap in first marriage rates would be much smaller. We conclude that marriage promotion policies may be ineffective in part because they are targeting women who face structural barriers to marriage in their local marriage markets.",TRUE,FALSE,american community survey|black women|demography|marriage|marriage markets|marriage promotion|race,2018-07-02T11:48:42.383082,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-18T13:47:38.754480,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/citation/,exvcm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vu3fe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/relationships/node/,vu3fe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad653fa2219a3000f2fe294/,5ad653fa2219a3000f2fe294,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exvcm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exvcm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exvcm,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023118791084

In this paper, I ask how exposure to mortgage default through social networks affects perceptions of the housing market, judgements about the strategic default behavior of other households and expectations for homeownership. Although individuals purposively draw on information from their social networks to aid in their housing search, theories of social influence have yet to be applied to the negative experience of mortgage delinquency or default.  Drawing on the National Housing Survey, I find that individuals exposed to mortgage delinquency through their social networks express more negative expectations for the housing market and hold a more permissive opinion about strategic default.  Homeowners reporting network exposure to mortgage strain are more likely to prefer rental housing when they next move. These results are strongest when individuals are connected to someone who has fallen behind on a mortgage payment in the previous three months.",TRUE,FALSE,homeownership|housing|mortgage delinquency|mortgage strain|social networks,2018-07-02T11:48:42.291200,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-18T13:19:31.306368,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Brian J.
