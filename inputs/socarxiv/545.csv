This paper studies the effects of several dissemination channels in an open access environment by analysing the download data of the OAPEN Library. 
Method. Download data were obtained containing the number of downloads and the name of the Internet provider. Based on public information, each Internet provider was categorised. The subject and language of each book were determined using metadata from the OAPEN Library. 
Analysis. Quantitative analysis was done using Excel, while the qualitative analysis was carried out using the statistical package SPSS. 
Results. Almost three quarters of all downloads come from users who do not use the Website www.oapen.org, but find the books by other means. Qualitative analysis found no evidence that channel use was influenced by user groups or the state of users' Internet infrastructure; nor was any effect on channel use found for either the language or the subjects of the monographs. 
Conclusions. The results show that most readers are using the ""direct download"" channel, which occur if the readers use systems other than the OAPEN Library Website. This implies that making the metadata available in the user's systems, the infrastructure used on a daily basis, ensures the best results.",TRUE,FALSE,dissemination channels|Monographs|Open access,2018-09-14T10:48:21.330658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T10:46:28.901031,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/citation/,54c7w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n8hj3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/relationships/node/,n8hj3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9b7e92f769de0018ff83fc/,5b9b7e92f769de0018ff83fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/54c7w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/54c7w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/54c7w,NA

In this paper I use high-resolution data based on unemployment insurance records to show that employment in US metropolitan areas is not centralized but is spatially concentrated. Unlike residents, who form a continuous surface covering most parts of each MSA, jobs have a bimodal spatial distribution, with most blocks containing no jobs whatsoever and a small number having extremely high employment densities. Across the 100 largest MSAs about 75% of jobs are located on the 10% of built land in Census blocks with at least twice as many jobs as people. Further, most of these jobs are in clustered business districts of more than 5 contiguous employment blocks. These relative proportions are extremely consistent across MSAs, even though cities vary greatly in the physical density at which they are constructed. Motivated by these empirical regularities, I introduce an algorithm to identify contiguous business districts and classify them into four major types. Based solely on the relative densities of employment and population, this algorithm is both simpler to implement and more flexible than current approaches, requiring no metro-specific tuning parameters and no assumptions about urban form. As one output, it provides an inductive, data-driven method of identifying city centers for the purposes of urban economic analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Central Business Districts|Employment Subcenters|GIS|Land use|Urb|Urban form|Urban Science,2018-09-14T09:50:40.866805,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T09:44:48.027336,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/citation/,6sxv5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q6g8e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/relationships/node/,q6g8e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9a8cd5bab52700160cc3cd/,5b9a8cd5bab52700160cc3cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sxv5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6sxv5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6sxv5,NA

Indeed, public opinion polls not only offer citizens a mechanism with which to express their sentiment on key issues of the day but also provide policy makers with information about what their constituents might or might not desire. Citizens may be able to express their views on a particular issue through individual acts such as donating money to a cause or writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper, but along with voting polls are one of the few opportunities that offer the mass public equal voice.

Here, I assess the informational value of such stimuli for the self-organization of conventions, a common large-group coordination problem. Participant exposure to a small number of additional stimuli can tip groups to coordinated outcomes through a rapid decrease in the diversity of the potential solutions. The information gained through these exposures is greater on average than that of a variety of alternatives, including additional weak ties.

The results indicate that high creative intensity of work is a strong predictor of an R&amp;D employee being satisfied with flexible rather than fixed working schedules. Women and employees with less creative and more administrative tasks perceive more constraints on the timing of their work due to jealousy of colleagues and they are more likely to feel that their creativity is adversely affected by their working time arrangements. Employees with flexibility in both the timing and place of doing their work are significantly less likely to perceive working time related constraints on their creativity or jealousy of their colleagues as a restraint on their working time choices than are those with a fixed working time and place. The higher the salary level of the employee, the more likely they are to feel that the nature of their work constrains their working time choices.

Blood donor populations have been susceptible to change, often showing a trend towards feminization while remaining ethnically homogeneous, leading to an underrepresentation of young men and ethnic minorities. The aim of our study was to examine whether recruitment strategies are related to donor diversity and loyalty of specific demographic groups in the Netherlands. 

Materials and methods. Analyses were conducted using the Dutch blood donor database on whole-blood donors registered between 2013 and 2017 (n = 155,054). Chi-square tests were used to study relationships between donor characteristics (i.e., sex, age, and Duffy-negative antigen as proxy for donors from African descent) and recruitment strategies; linear and Cox regressions were used to study relationships between recruitment strategies, and number of donations and length of the donor career, respectively. 

Results. Most donors were recruited via other donors (44.6%) or became donor on their own initiative (28.4%). Young men were often recruited by other donors and Duffy-negative donors were often recruited via missing minorities campaigns. Donor-recruits-donor was associated with the highest number of donations; telephone recruitment was associated with the lowest number of donations. Although telephone recruitment was associated with the longest donor careers, it also showed the largest proportional stopping prevalence. Student recruitment and missing minorities campaigns were associated with the shortest donor careers. 

Conclusions. Our results showed proportional differences in how people from different sex, age and ethnicity are recruited, and how recruitment relates to donor loyalty.

Australia has provided a convincing case that plain packaging of tobacco products is compatible with the TRIPS Agreement 1994 – particularly the clauses relating to the aims and objectives of the agreement; the requirements in respect of trade mark law; and the parallel measures in relation to access to essential medicines. Australia has also defended the consistency of plain packaging of tobacco products with the TBT Agreement 1994. Moreover, Australia has provided clear reasons for why the plain packaging of tobacco products is compatible with GATT.

These election outcomes are usually forecasted by voter intention polls, structural models, or a combination of the two. For voter turnout, election forecasts come almost exclusively from likelihood-to-vote polls. We develop a structural model of turnout for the British case, and then combine it with likelihood-to-vote polls. We compare poll, structural, and combined forecasts in out-of-sample tests of 18 British general elections from 1951 to 2017. Compared to the polls, the structural model forecasts more accurately, and combining the polls with the structural model increases accuracy even further.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian model averaging|British|election forecast|forecast|forecast combination|fundamentals|polls|turnout|UK,2018-09-11T20:03:02.225255,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T15:38:51.353748,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/citation/,s2j6h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mjzdk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/relationships/node/,mjzdk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b97d391715bea00154f8956/,5b97d391715bea00154f8956,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2j6h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s2j6h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s2j6h,NA

Consensus on what identity is and what it does in relation to foreign policy does not exist and is unlikely to be ever forged. Some scholars investigate state identity—how it informs and shapes foreign policy processes while simultaneously being informed and shaped by international structures. Others use the concept of identification to examine what foreign policy means for the constitution of modern political subjectivities. Still others seek to bring together constructivist identity scholarship together with more established approaches in Foreign Policy Analysis. This article considers the contextual emergence and evolution of the “identity and foreign policy” scholarship in its many different and differing streams. The large volume of literature produced on this subject over the past two and a half decade defies an easy summary of its theoretical and empirical contributions, but an overview of the main controversies and debates should provide the reader with a solid foundation for further research.",TRUE,FALSE,Constructivism|Foreign Policy|Identity|International Relations|National Identity|State Identity,2018-09-11T20:00:25.421183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T15:38:27.395969,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/citation/,zdksp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yqbfs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/relationships/node/,yqbfs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b97cbb2296328001ac559db/,5b97cbb2296328001ac559db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdksp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zdksp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zdksp,NA

To flesh out our understanding of how heterogeneous educational gradients in health manifest across racial subpopulations in the U.S., I examine how income---a crucial, salubrious resource that is returned by education and experienced differently by race---mediates the relationship between college attainment and health status among Blacks and Whites. To this end, I describe how the association among college completion and health status would manifest among these racial groups if income were factored out of the education-health generative process. I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 7,222) and sequential g-estimation for this investigation. Results suggest that income plays a proportionally larger role in mediating the association among college completion and health status for Blacks and, as such, that racial differences in health-returns to college persist after controlling for income. Differences in how income behaves as a mechanism across racial populations hint that race(-ism) plays a dynamic role in structuring the underlying education-health generative process.",TRUE,FALSE,education|health disparities|population health|race|sequential g-estimation,2018-09-11T19:58:02.202744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T15:38:04.618230,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Michael H.
