The richest cities now have per capita incomes almost 40% greater than the nation as a whole, while the poorest ones have incomes 25% smaller. In this paper I use counterfactual simulations based on Census microdata to understand the dynamics of regional divergence. I first show that regional divergence has largely resulted from the richest people and places pulling away from the rest of the country. I then estimate the relative contributions to regional divergence of two major socioeconomic trends of the last 40 years: the sorting of people across metro areas by income level and the national rise in income inequality. I show that the national rise in income inequality is sufficient on its own to account for more than half of the observed divergence across regions, while income sorting on its own accounts for less than a quarter. The major driver of regional economic divergence is national-level income dispersion that has exacerbated preexisting spatial inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,Income inequality|Regional development|Regional divergence|Simulation|Spatial inequality,2018-07-02T11:41:29.124164,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-28T13:11:28.427173,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/citation/,9hmes,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/epruq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/relationships/node/,epruq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a963690da91d4000db273c1/,5a963690da91d4000db273c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hmes/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9hmes/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soz013,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9hmes

New Housework Theories for Changing Families,"Theoretical approaches to housework do not reflect contemporary families and gender relations. We evaluate assumptions about gender and families in three dominant explanations and propose theoretical extensions. First, we suggest a work-family fit approach that examines housework and resources at a household level. Second, we propose the diverse capital perspective that extends earnings centered assessments of housework bargaining. Finally, a ""doing genders"" approach captures how gender shapes housework in nuanced ways. Our study does not focus on the more general issue of power in relationships, nor do we seek to dismantle existing theoretical perspectives or solve all shortcomings of the inherently couple-centered and cissexist heteronormative approach to families that primarily focuses on the United States. Rather, we provide some insight into how these theories can be expanded given the realities of diverse family arrangements, stalled gender revolutions, and shifts and fluidity in gender and sexual identities.",TRUE,FALSE,family|Gender relations|household labor|housework|non market work|same-sex couples|theory|time use,2018-07-02T11:41:28.998336,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-28T23:53:22.468094,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/citation/,k6gyh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/apbnz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/relationships/node/,apbnz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a96138bda91d4000db2670d/,5a96138bda91d4000db2670d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6gyh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k6gyh/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jftr.12245,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k6gyh

Racial Differences in College Behaviors and Attendance,"According to the influential “oppositional culture” account, we should expect black students as a group to be less likely to engage in school than their white counterparts because they are more likely to believe and act in opposition to academics. In contrast to this prediction, qualitative and quantitative researchers have almost uniformly deduced that black students hold similar or higher educational values, attitudes, and expectations as compared to whites. 
I pull from the rich literature on racial differences in educational attitudes and expectations to posit that instead of black students shirking education, black students are actually more likely to act in favor of education, and that this might help explain their higher net rates of college attendance as indicated in prior research. Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), I find that black students’ higher rates of engagement in college-going behaviors mediate the relationship between race and college attendance so that race is no longer a significant predictor of attendance.

These differences can vary by where on the Internet couples met, with online dating websites and apps showing a clear effect on increased age assortativity, while other online sources of partners do not.

impact of a poverty alleviation program, a conditional cash transfer (CCT) that attempted to incentivize
poor mothers, through a direct cash transfer, to send their children to school. The program met its goal. The
mothers did send their children to school. I argue that only observing this outcome of school access, however,
black-boxes the causal pathway of how mothers sent their children to school in the Egyptian context, and
how the program mattered. Public schools in Egypt are free on paper but expensive in practice due to an
informal system of “private lesson” and “study group” fees imposed by teachers. Mothers had always managed
this expense, using scarce gendered household resources, before, during, and after the program.
Through ethnographic, interview, and survey data, this article shows that while the cash—transferred to the
mothers and labeled for education—enabled the mothers to send their children to school, the program conditions
were unnecessary. The mothers did not need to be nudged to send their children to school. This Egyptian
case study has implications for the use of behavioral incentives and for the importance of qualitative

The recent branding of Russian agriculture as the ecologically clean alternative to genetically engineered foods is suggestive of an economic motive behind the information campaign against western biotechnologies.",TRUE,FALSE,genetic engineering|genetics|GMO|Russia|social media,2018-07-02T11:41:27.488078,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-27T12:49:38.920951,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/citation/,26ubf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v27yh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/relationships/node/,v27yh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9442b4da91d4000fb1b995/,5a9442b4da91d4000fb1b995,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26ubf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26ubf

We test this proposition by comparing the risk of entering fixed-term employment for individually laid off workers with that for individuals who have left their previous job for other reasons. This strategy is based on the assumption that in the German context individual layoffs create uncertainty about job seekers' productivity. We use data on work exits and subsequent labour market re-entry of the prime-age workforce in Germany from waves 2000-2013 of the Socio-Economic Panel. Our results show that the risk of fixed-term employment is substantively smaller after voluntary job exits but reveal only a small and statistically insignificant risk difference between individual layoffs and workplace closures after adjusting for differences in socio-economic background and characteristics of the previous job. These findings challenge the view that employers use fixed-term contracts as an instrument to screen specific groups of workers whose productivity is highly uncertain, at least with regard to recent career disruptions.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed-term employment|Germany|job exit|screening,2018-07-02T11:41:27.146622,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-26T15:24:43.313916,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/citation/,zuwat,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zeq4b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/relationships/node/,zeq4b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a940e74da91d4000fb18ea2/,5a940e74da91d4000fb18ea2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zuwat/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zuwat/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcy003,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zuwat

Existing defnitions of critical thinking, however, tend to be rather vague, and, as a consequence, they provide neither an accurate nor a precise understanding of critical thinking. In this paper, I propose to understand critical thinking as a metacognitive skill applicable to the evaluation of truth
claims. Critical thinking as a metacognitive skill consists of three components: Minimization of logical fallacies, minimization of cognitive biases, and a probabilistic epistemology. Understood in this manner, critical thinking can improve the quality of our inferences about the world.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:41:26.938973,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-26T15:23:44.903803,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/citation/,wqarp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xgcj4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/relationships/node/,xgcj4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a93eaec91b689000da163f7/,5a93eaec91b689000da163f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqarp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wqarp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wqarp
