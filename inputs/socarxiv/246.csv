After a slight decline in 2014 to 69.2 percent, the response rate fell abruptly to 61.3 percent in 2016.  In 2018, it fell again, but by a more modest amount to 59.5 percent.  The reasons for the recent declines are not fully understood, and research with auxiliary data and other surveys may be able to provide additional clarity in the future.  In the meantime, I offer this report to promote transparency and reassurance.  On the one hand, the GSS is fighting the same non-response headwind that other national surveys confront, and thus there is reason to be concerned.  On the other hand, the problem is not so acute that a decline in the demographic representativeness of the GSS is yet apparent.

Although both concepts are theoretically related, to date they have not been analyzed together. In this study, we identify their theoretical underpinnings and determine how they can be measured empirically. We analyze how listening to music causes nostalgia and melancholia, and whether both experiences are related to different behavioral intentions. To this end, we conducted an online experiment with 359 participants who listened to music they considered either nostalgic, melancholic, or neutral. Afterward, participants answered 122 items related to nostalgia and melancholia. Using Structural Equation Modeling, and more specifically Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes Modeling, we first developed two new scales, the Formative Nostalgia Scale and the Formative Melancholia Scale. Both scales consist of five items each. Results showed that listening to music indeed increased nostalgia and melancholia. Although considerably different, both concepts are related nonetheless: Listening to nostalgic music increases melancholia, whereas listening to melancholic music does not increase nostalgia. In addition, both experiences are related to different behavioral intentions: Whereas experiencing nostalgia was associated with a stronger intention to share the music and listen to it again, experiencing melancholia revealed the exact opposite relation.",TRUE,FALSE,media effects|melancholia|music|nostalgia|online experiment|scale development,2020-03-03T18:57:36.664614,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-03T18:26:08.849365,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/citation/,dt7v8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5e525186b40d00b3d03f1c/,5e5e525186b40d00b3d03f1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dt7v8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dt7v8,NA

Russia's labour market should have high rates of job mobility, but we will show using IMF figures that the  rate between 2011 and 2015 is on par with the 1980's. Beyond this, little is known about who is mobile and whether mobility has any impact on wages once the characteristics of movers are controlled for. In other words, we will ask whether job mobility is a sorting mechanism, or whether it has premiums in pay in and of itself. Results  show a gender difference in the likelihood of firm exit but not in the likelihood of promotion. When several personal and job characteristics are held constant, young men and women have similar odds of promotion. However, promotions have a positive effect only on the wages of young women; young men's wages are not affected. On the topic of firm exits, when several personal and job characteristics are held constant, exit is more common among young men when compared to young women;  this is also true of middle aged men and women. Further, young men see a significant  decrease in wages following an exit, while young women are not affected by exit. These results are flipped for middle aged workers; middle aged men see no change in wages following an exit, but middle aged women see significant declines in wages following an exit. Using these results, the article shows that the early stages of a respondent's career are marked by periods of high mobility, which is similar to the experience of young workers in other countries. After this period,  mobility becomes increasingly unlikely. Part of this result could stem from the premiums tied to promotion. Results help to understand processes of inequality in wages and conditions that occur due to sorting, and the importance of promotions  (internal job changes with the same employer) as 'life chances' which improve  earnings in the immediate sense. Gender differences in securing these life chances help to understand wider gender gaps in earnings, which emerge later.",TRUE,FALSE,Gender|Inequality|Job mobility|Panel analysis|Russia,2020-03-03T18:57:00.927244,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-03T18:23:11.831886,FALSE,NA,no,This dataset requires an application.,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/citation/,ncb5p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5d83e186b40d0042d0536a/,5e5d83e186b40d0042d0536a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncb5p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ncb5p,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecot.12264

This debate generated ample empirical evidence of the environmental damage caused by tourism-related human activity. It is underpinned, however, by a passive position: one of largely accepting the tourism industry as it is, and lamenting its negative consequences. An alternative, more active approach, is to deliberately design for environmental sustainability. This article provides examples of how the tourism industry can drive a reduction of environmental damage by actively designing brand-owned touchpoints in a way that entice tourists to behave more environmentally friendly.

The goal of this paper is to experimentally explore who is good at distinguishing between true and false, and, second, to learn something about the mechanisms to debunk false news stories. While the vast majority of earlier studies tackles political topics, the subjects had to rate environmental-related as correct or false. After this exercise, subjects received systematically varied information about the correctness of the news stories depending on the experimental condition they had been assigned to. After a delay of three weeks, the subjects were asked to evaluate the news stories again. Our main findings are (i) The perceived familiarity with news stories increases the propensity to accept them as true. Actively open-minded thinking helps to distinguish between true and false. But the willingness to think deliberately does not seem to be important. (ii) By repeating false news stories, subjects are more likely to adequately identify them later (i.e., no evidence for a familiarity backfire effect). However, it decreased the ability to adequately identify correct news stories. A somewhat reverse, but weaker effect occurs when true stories are repeated: the correct identification of correct news stories is more successful, but the opposite holds for the identification of false news stories. Detailed explanations of why the false news stories contain false content increases the correct identification of false news stories, but the ability to correctly identify correct news stories is detrimental.",TRUE,FALSE,actively open-minded thinking|cognitive reflection test|environmental economics|experimental economics|False news stories|narratives,2020-03-02T02:50:52.978501,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-02T02:50:27.541845,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/citation/,zmx5p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5b308bef5d8901ca06cc9d/,5e5b308bef5d8901ca06cc9d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmx5p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmx5p,NA

G​lobal catastrophic biological risks​ (GCBRs) are a recognized subset of these risks, and include both natural and engineered pathogens. Viral pathogens are of particular concern due to their high virulence and transmissibility. Various actors including national governments, scientific agencies and philanthropic institutes have attempted to address the risk posed by viral pathogens by supporting ​broad-spectrum antiviral (BSAV) development. This report aims to describe the global landscape of this effort to date, including: 1: The ​policy and practice​ landscape for BSAV funding and research, internationally; 2: The United States ​policy and practice​ landscape; 3: Past and present United States R​ &amp;D efforts​ towards BSAVs.

It argues for the importance of open data in citizen science, both in platform design and in citizen science outputs, to support active citizenship and sustainability beyond a funding cycle. 
This article discusses open datasets developed during the Ebola outbreak response in 2014 and the role of collaborative repositories such as GitHub in enabling uses beyond any particular citizen science project.
