This qualitative study contributes to resolving this need by engaging 26 five- to seven-year-old Finnish preschoolers in an open-ended drawing task to answer the following research questions: What aspects of digital games appear meaningful for young children when they act as game designers? Why are these aspects meaningful for young children? The findings suggest that children are not mere passive consumers of digital games but are agentic meaning-makers who are capable of critically evaluating digital games when a safe, and supportive space and the appropriate medium are provided. The children refined, modified, and personalized existing influential games by replacing the leading male character with a female one or by having a player operate as the antagonist instead of the hero. The findings suggest that there are vast unexplored dimensions for scholars to engage with in young children’s gaming cultures, children’s perceptions of game content, early game literacy, as well as children’s meaning-making in games.

Subsequently, I examined my limited files and found evidence that we: 1) included hundreds of duplicates, 2) underreported the number of counties, and 3) somehow added another 316 respondents right before publication (and over a year after the survey was conducted) without changing nearly any of the reported statistics (means, standard deviations, regression coefficients). The survey company confirmed that it sent us only 500 respondents, not the 1,184 reported in the article. I obtained and reanalyzed those data. This report presents the findings from my reanalysis, which suggest that the sample was not just duplicated. The data were also altered—intentionally or unintentionally—in other ways, and those alterations produced the article’s main findings. Additionally, we misreported data characteristics as well as aspects of our analysis and findings, and we failed to report the use of imputation for missing data. The following eight findings emerged from my reanalysis:

1)	The article reports 1,184 respondents, but actually there are 500. 
2)	The article reports 91 counties, but actually there are 326.
3)	The article describes respondents that differ substantially from those in the data.
4)	The article reports two significant interaction effects, but actually there are none.  
5)	The article reports the effect of Hispanic growth is significant and positive, but actually it is non-significant and negative.  
6)	The article reports many other findings that do not exist in the data.
7)	The standard errors are stable in our published article, but not in the actual data or in articles published by other authors using similar modeling techniques with large samples.

Differentiated access to integration for asylum seekers in Germany,"This paper investigates the normative permissibility of differential inclusion policies, taking Germany as a case study. In the face of mounting asylum applications, Germany introduced new administrative rules differentiating access to integration for asylum seekers. The paper normatively examines whether this practice is consistent with two conventional liberal concepts: special obligations grounding the moral commitments of the liberal state towards its own citizens and the principle of legal certainty grounding its moral commitments towards everyone under its jurisdiction, including asylum seekers. Combining these two usually separately employed perspectives, it argues that while differential inclusion is in principle consistent with these liberal principles, the crude criterion of the country of origin does not comply with both perspectives.

County Median Income Changes and Low Birth Weight Incidence Rates for Black and White Americans,"Differences in low birth weight incidence (LBW) by race and place are long-standing, often embedded in enduring social ecologies where insufficient health resources are paired with an array of risk factors.  Local or group-specific economic resources are known to be a fundamental contributor to these social ecologies, yet few studies have investigated how within-area changing economic conditions are linked to birth outcomes.  This study examines county-level change in median income and black-white income differences as predictors of LBW incidence and LBW racial disparities.  Time-varying county prevalence and black-white differences in maternal sociodemographic and health risk factors (e.g., non-marital childbearing, smoking during pregnancy) are considered as explanations for income estimates. Data come from U.S. birth records for approximately 24.8 million non-Hispanic black and white mothers with a singleton live birth (1992-2014).  Records were aggregated in three-year county-period measurements for the 732 counties meeting eligibility requirements.  Based on county by period fixed effects models, a $10,000 increase in county median income was associated with a reduction in LBW incidence of 2.7 per 1000 live births, and in the black-white LBW gap by 5.6 per 1000.  Time-varying county maternal sociodemographic and health risks attenuated the link between median income and LBW by 72% and 31%, respectively, but not the association between median income and the racial LBW gap.  Contrary to our hypothesis, conditioning on median income changes, a widening racial income difference was associated with a smaller black-white LBW gap (a finding explored in post hoc analyses).  Our results suggest that, if successful in raising median income, local government efforts to stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities are likely to reduce both population incidence and black-white differences in LBW.

Wild pigs were first introduced to the Canadian prairies in the 1980s and are now present in all Canadian provinces except those in the farthest east in Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador). A telephone survey was conducted with 3007 rural Canadians in all ten provinces in order to quantify the level of awareness and concern regarding invasive wild pig impacts in their province. Rural Canadians have overall low awareness of the presence of wild pigs in their region. As expected, awareness of wild pigs was lowest in provinces where they were absent or rare (&lt;10% of respondents aware in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada), low in the two provinces where wild pigs are well established and relatively widespread in rural areas (22% of respondents aware in Alberta and Manitoba), and moderate awareness in the one province with by far the most expansive distribution of wild pigs (42% of respondents aware in Saskatchewan). In Atlantic Canada where there are no known wild pigs, 2% of respondents incorrectly indicated that they were aware of their presence. Concerns regarding impacts were overall moderate to low, with no province having a mean concern level ≥ 7 out of 10) for crop damage, livestock predation and harassment, structural damage, environmental impacts, threats to native wildlife, disease transmission to humans, or disease transmission to wildlife and livestock, and threats to human safety and well-being. Since rural Canadians experience the direct and indirect impacts from invasive wild pigs, our findings will inform management efforts and help to effectively engage rural Canadians in this rapidly emerging crisis. Communication and collaboration efforts through a range of conventional and social media are needed to help inform rural Canadians about the presence of wild pigs and the associated risks and impacts. Our findings help explain the overall very low effort in most of Canada to develop management strategies and implement control efforts.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|Canada|feral swine|invasive species|Sus scrofa|wild pig,2019-07-04T20:04:47.513966,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-04T20:04:28.711763,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,Mackenzie Clarke and Ryan Brook,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/citation/,k473n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d1d346262a173001a373fdb/,5d1d346262a173001a373fdb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k473n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k473n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k473n,NA

El relativo desconocimiento que hay hasta la actualidad sobre la arqueología pedemontana de la región amerita un esfuerzo por facilitar el acceso a las descripciones de sitios y materiales allí identificados.

Buena parte de las investigaciones no se materializan en publicaciones
académicas o tardan en hacerlo, con lo cual una gran cantidad de información permanece inaccesible para otros equipos, e incluso para las comunidades locales. Esperamos que esta serie de informes ayude a rellenar parcialmente los intersticios entre trabajos de campo y publicaciones, y que los datos originales generados queden públicamente disponibles. Aprovechamos la posibilidad que nos brinda
este tipo de formato para incluir abundante material gráfico que complementa las descripciones realizadas, y, que en ocasiones no puede ser incluido en su totalidad en los trabajos de divulgación científica.

Si bien el informe se centra en la descripción de los sitios y materiales
trabajados, también hemos incluido algunas interpretaciones breves de carácter teórico a fines de otorgar una visión integradora del registro. Parte de las hipótesis que planteábamos en estos primeros pasos han sido corroboradas, mientras que otras fueron descartadas, sin embargo, preferimos exponerlas de la forma en la que las pensábamos hace algunos años atrás, intentando que este material también sirva como mapa de ruta de la evolución de nuestras interpretaciones.",TRUE,FALSE,Anfama|Archaeology|Northwestern Argentina|Piedemonte,2019-07-05T16:17:27.342060,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-05T16:17:04.715225,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/citation/,tf82g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uvecg/,uvecg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d1d241fce16db001a58bb39/,5d1d241fce16db001a58bb39,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf82g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tf82g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tf82g,NA
