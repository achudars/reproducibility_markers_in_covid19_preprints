Focusing on openness to racial exogamy as an indicator of racial boundaries, we examine the link between Christian nationalism and white Americans’ views toward their hypothetical daughter marrying an African American, Latino, or Asian. Drawing on theoretical insights from social identity complexity theory, we argue that the convergence of religious and national identities serves to reinforce in-group boundaries, thereby fortifying notions of white purity, and consequently, strengthening whites’ discomfort with potential race-mixing in marriage. Multivariate analyses of national survey data demonstrate that Christian nationalism is strongly associated with an increase in white Americans’ discomfort with their daughter marrying any racial minority, and particularly African Americans.

Drawing upon national-level data and employing the theoretical construct of social identity complexity, we examine the link between Christian nationalism–representing a convergence of national and religious identities–and Americans’ views toward same-sex marriage and civil unions. Multivariate analyses reveal that greater adherence to Christian nationalism is strongly and negatively related to support for both same-sex marriage and civil unions, even after controlling for political ideology, religious controls, attribution of homosexuality, and other relevant correlates. We argue that Christian nationalists, who by definition internalize a high degree of overlap between political and religious identities, are more likely to see gays and lesbians as out-groups and same-sex unions as a threat to their sense of self and community.

Little is known, however, about how the popular phenomenon of small groups factors into this equation. In the present study, we examine relationships between small group participation at individual and congregation levels and civic engagement. Using multilevel modeling and national data on congregations and individuals from the U.S. Congregational Life Study (n = 82,044), we find that: (1) individual-level small group involvement is associated with four measures of civic engagement; (2) congregation-level small group participation is associated with both lower and higher civic engagement in the case of two outcomes; and (3) in the case of three civic outcomes, congregation-level small group participation moderates individual-level small group involvement such that small group members’ civic activity more closely resembles the lower civic engagement of small group nonparticipants. In the case of one civic outcome, at high levels of overall small group participation, small group members’ civic engagement drops below that of small group nonparticipants. Explanations for these findings, including a “crowding out” effect, are examined including their complex implications for debates regarding small groups, religious involvement, and civic engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,Civic engagement|Organizations|Religion|Small groups|Social capital|Social networks,2019-01-22T12:41:01.091682,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-22T11:57:12.624184,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/citation/,7zprq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c464e7037763200192e4601/,5c464e7037763200192e4601,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zprq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7zprq/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.10.006,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7zprq

Drawing upon national survey data, we fit logistic regression models and compute standardized logistic regression coefficients to estimate the relative net effects of religious tradition, practices, and beliefs about the Bible on support for same-sex adoption. Findings reveal that religious factors are among the strongest predictors of opposition to same-sex adoption, but that religious tradition has no significant effect on support for same-sex adoption once frequency of religious practice and beliefs about the Bible are held constant. Americans who more frequently engage in practices such as religious service attendance and sacred text reading are less supportive of same-sex adoption, and compared to biblical literalists, those who believe the Bible requires interpretation, contains human error, or is a book of history/legends are all more likely to support same-sex adoption.

Prior work has not considered, however, whether such beliefs may influence the racial views of nonwhite Americans differently from white Americans. Drawing on a representative sample of black and white Americans from the 2014 General Social Survey, and focusing on explanations for racial inequality as the outcome, we show that, contrary to white Americans, black Americans who view being a Christian as essential to being an American are actually more likely to attribute black–white inequality to structural issues and less to blacks’ individual shortcomings.

The filter theory of education (Arrow 1973), the theory of education as a “signal” (Spence 1973) and the theory of “screening” (Stiglitz 1975), for instance, have seriously challenged it from within mainstream economics, and heavy criticism has also come from other paradigms, with Bailly (2016) recently documenting the critique from the radical school. Within this set of ideas that flourished in the post-WWII period and challenged human capital theory, John Kenneth Galbraith’s analysis of the dynamics of the education process is often neglected. In his original institutionalist and firm-based approach to the evolution of education, Galbraith placed great emphasis on the issue of the requirements of the planning system when he tackled the issue of human capital investment. More surprisingly – since he is unanimously recognized as the “founding father” of the “human capital revolution” – Theodore Schultz himself developed a substantial critique of human capital theory that shares some ground with Galbraith’s. The aim of this contribution is to provide new insights into the history of post-WWII ideas in the field of economics of education by reviewing Schultz’s and Galbraith’s respective analyses of education and highlighting their proximities. Both authors raise doubts regarding the idea that the aggregation of individual choices must be regarded as the relevant generative mechanism of the dynamic of education and the basis of the allocation of education resources.

However, many low-income households are disadvantaged because existing public transit service does not provide them with sufficient access to destinations. Limited transit options, compounded with socioeconomic disadvantage, can result in transport poverty, preventing travel to important destinations, like employment opportunities. Given the growing gentrification of Canadian downtowns and the dispersion of poverty into Canadian suburbs, the time is right for a national accounting of those living in transport poverty, and the development of a national transport and land use strategy for alleviating the risks of accessibility deprivation. Accordingly, in this paper we measure and analyze vertical inequalities in access to employment in Canadian cities in order to estimate how many, where, and to what extent, Canadians are at risk of transport poverty. We make use of open transit network data and cutting edge accessibility measurement methods to generate comparative scores suitable for a national-scale analysis. We find that in aggregate, lower income neighbourhoods tend to have better levels of transit accessibility. But despite this overall positive outlook, there are still nearly one million low-income individuals living in urban areas with low transit accessibility. We summarize our findings by generating descriptive typologies for areas vulnerable to transport poverty which are then used to develop and recommend planning strategies to reduce inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|canada|geography|inequalities|policy|poverty|public transit|transit|transport|transportation|urban,2019-01-18T20:52:09.642085,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-18T20:51:48.661126,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/citation/,ua2gj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c423920154ce50018dd1423/,5c423920154ce50018dd1423,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ua2gj/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2018.11.018,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ua2gj

Despite its widespread use, few measurement options allow for the comparison of accessibility across multiple urban systems, and most do not adequately control for market competition between demand‐side actors and supply‐side facilities in localized markets. In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities. We use this method to compute access to employment for Canada's eight largest cities to comparatively examine inequalities in accessibility, both within and between cities, and by travel mode.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|canada|competition|geography|transit|transport|transportation|urban,2019-01-18T20:52:27.580410,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-18T20:52:07.689875,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/citation/,8yf7q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4234de154ce50017dcf514/,5c4234de154ce50017dcf514,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yf7q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8yf7q/,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12188,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8yf7q

In gerontology, we might consider Big Data to be defined as any set of observations that exceeds the capacities of traditional gerontological approaches to store, analyze, or make inferences due to its volume, velocity, or complexity. Thus, Big Data is not simply a large number of observations in a dataset but also can be defined in terms of how such a dataset is handled; including, possibly, whether it has lasting clinical, policy, or research significance (Lynch, 2008).",TRUE,FALSE,big data|gerontology,2019-01-18T19:52:42.181436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-18T19:52:33.286632,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/citation/,cp3a8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c42250f377632001a29557c/,5c42250f377632001a29557c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp3a8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cp3a8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cp3a8
