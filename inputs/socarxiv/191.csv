However, they can be properly underlain by philosophical and scientific anthropology as that biological species who will originate from humans eventually in the course of evolution. There is a series of more or less well-established facts in anthropogenesis, which would be relevant to the philosophical question about the “super-humans”: bipedalism, cooling by sweating, specific hair or its lack, omnivorous-ness, thumb opposition and apposition, vocal system of speech production, human brain, long childhood; our species is evolutionary young (about 200 000 years old), but it is the last survived descendant being genetically exceptionally homogenous (&lt;00,01% genetic differences) of the genus “homo” (about 6 000 000 old). All this generates a few main features of our population: society, technics, language, and mind, which guarantee the contemporary absolute domination of mankind. The society has reached a natural limitation of earth. The technics depends on how much energy is produced. The mind is restricted by its carrier, i.e. by the brain. Thus only the language seems to be the frontier of any future development inducing a much better use of the former three. The recent informational technologies suggest the same. Language is defined as symbolic image of the world doubling it by an ideal or virtual world, which is fruitful for creativity and any modeling of the real world. Consequently, a gap between the material and the ideal world produces language. The language increases that gap in turn. Furthermore, the ideal world is secondary and derivative from the material world in origin and objectivity: Language serves for the world to be ordered. Thus language refers to the philosophical categories of ‘being’ and ‘time’. Any “super-language” should transcend some of those definitive borders of language and be a generalization. The involving of infinity can extend the language. Any human language is finite and addresses some finite reality. Thus the gap between reality and any model in language can be seen as that between infinity and its limitation to any finite representation: Finite representations dominate over society, technics, and the mind use. A “super-language” as an “infinite language” can be approached in a few reference frames: Husserl’s “Back to the things themselves!” if “phenomenon” in his philosophy is thought as the ‘word’ of the language of consciousness; the semantic and philosophical theory of symbol: from consciousness and language to reality; the concept of infinity in mathematics and its foundation: set or category theory; quantum mechanics and information: the coincidence of the quantum model and reality; quantum computer.

A Deep Learning Language Model Demonstrates the Vision Advantage of Being Small,"Which groups are most likely to become visionaries that define the future of their field? Because vision is difficult to measure, prior work has reached conflicting conclusions: one perspective emphasizes the benefits of being large, established, and central, while another stresses the value of being small, upstart, and peripheral. We propose that this tension can be resolved by disentangling vision---the capacity to generate contextually novel ideas that foretell the future of a field---from the traces of vision that result in tangible innovation. Using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), we develop a novel method to identify the visionaries in a field from conversational text data. Applying this method to a corpus of over 100,000 quarterly earnings calls conducted by 6,000 firms from 2011 to 2016, we develop a measure---prescience---that identifies novel ideas which later become commonplace. Prescience is predictive of firms’ stock market returns: A one standard deviation increase in prescience is associated with a 4% increase in annual returns, and firms exhibiting especially high levels of prescience (above the 95th percentile) reap especially high returns. Moreover, contrary to theories of incumbent advantage, we find that small firms are more likely to possess prescience than large firms. The method we develop can be readily extended to other domains to identify visionary individuals and groups based on the language they use rather than the artifacts they produce.",TRUE,FALSE,Contextual Word Embeddings|Firm Performance|Innovation|Vision,2020-05-26T21:54:21.234833,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-26T21:53:49.505080,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",Paul Vicinanza; Amir Goldberg; Sameer Srivastava,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/citation/,j24pw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecd8175c7568602112d0c0a/,5ecd8175c7568602112d0c0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j24pw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j24pw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j24pw

However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city.  We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths.   The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors).  Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample.  We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect.  UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself.  We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance.   We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body.  This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present.  In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.",TRUE,FALSE,elevation|immunity|pandemia|Transmission rates;|Ultraviolet radiation,2020-05-26T21:52:24.082499,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-26T21:52:08.472856,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/citation/,je7vt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4w2tb/,4w2tb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecd61bac7568601f42d2c0e/,5ecd61bac7568601f42d2c0e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/je7vt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/je7vt

Granting to the World Travel and Tourism Council, Travel and Tourism Industry is one of the world’s most significant economic sectors accounting for 10.4% of global GDP and 313 million jobs, or 9.9% of total employment, in 2017. The direct and indirect impact of the industry on real estate development in the world is tremendous in terms of accommodation, catering to food and beverages, leisure, pleasure and relaxation. In Sri Lanka, tourism is the third-largest export earner in the economy, and during the past five years, there has been an unprecedented growth in the industry. However, tourism in Sri Lanka has much more untapped potential; thereby, the sector is poised to generate a range of growth and investment opportunities. However, it is only through the right policies and investment decisions; Sri Lanka can leverage the economic prospects of the Travel and Tourism Industry. This study analyses the importance of the Travel and Tourism Industry in terms of real estate development. It reviews significant trends that are shaping the growth and development of the Travel and Tourism Industry in Sri Lanka and aim to produce useful inputs for policy implications. The analysis is based on modified Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008 published by World Travel and Tourism Council, and carried out analysing both academic and non-academic publications, including published journal articles, annual and quarterly reports published by United Nations’ World Tourism Organization, World Travel and Tourism Council, World Economic Forum and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and through the raw data obtained by World Travel and Tourism Council for Sri Lanka. As per the analysis, the future outlook is bright for the tourism sector in Sri Lanka, and the country is expected to maintain a high rate of growth well into the next decade.",TRUE,FALSE,Real Estate Development|Sri Lanka|Tourism Trends|Travel and Tourism Industry,2020-05-26T21:47:24.041453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-26T21:47:09.012307,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/568vnrfvgr.1,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/citation/,z7ge2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eccb9cdaeeb6d018608a2fc/,5eccb9cdaeeb6d018608a2fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7ge2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z7ge2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z7ge2

While most studies that aim to explain such differences focus on institutions, a smaller literature refers to the influence of cultural norms or a complex interaction between the two. Empirically, however, it is yet unclear if such norms play a role and how they—jointly with institutions—contribute to motherhood penalties. We make use of a unique historical setting that allows us to assess how societal contexts affect maternal work preferences and labor market outcomes in the short- and long-run. Germany’s division into socialist East and parliamentary democratic West led to considerably different gender norms. But German reunification in 1990 mostly realigned gendered institutions. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we show that East and West German mothers’ preferred and realized labor force participation and working hours nevertheless remain divergent. We then focus on East German women who moved to the West during and after the country’s transitionary period. Despite moving to a context with more conservative gender norms, East German mothers in the West retain and fulfill their work preferences. Our findings imply that it is the structural legacy of past norms and institutions, not current ones, that shapes maternal work preferences and thus pave the way for motherhood penalties. Moreover, societal norms at the time of childbirth do not directly affect mothers’ labor force participation, working hours, or wages. Gendered outcomes in the labor market are thus highly dependent on institutional and normative changes across cohorts.",TRUE,FALSE,gender wage gap|German reunification|institutions|motherhood penalty|societal norms|work preferences,2020-05-26T18:00:27.820291,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-26T17:59:58.780935,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/citation/,xym2u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecbead4c75686018c2d398d/,5ecbead4c75686018c2d398d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xym2u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xym2u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xym2u
