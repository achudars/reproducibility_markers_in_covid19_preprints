We examine whether particular forms of long-term economic decline affect how residents in different places view the world; here in former coalmining communities of the UK which remain economically peripheral, and are home to community narratives that emphasise the shared economic, political and cultural heritages that are often fundamental those places’ very existence. We use data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study to contrast political views and social attitudes in communities that were, in 1981, economically dependent on coal mining, with other communities that are similarly economically peripheral in contexts and challenges, but without a shared history of economic decline. We find that residents of former coalmining communities are highly politically disengaged, with low levels of trust and political efficacy, and low involvement in the political process. Moreover, our analysis shows an increase in political engagement over the Brexit campaign period, which directly addressed some of the grievances felt by these communities. We conclude that community narratives of economic peripherality are strongly inter-linked with trust in government and political engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,coal mining|industrial decline|left-behind places|peripherality|political efficacy|regional development,2020-09-09T18:13:22.998397,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-09T18:10:46.202308,FALSE,NA,no,Data obtained under secure access agreement.,,no,,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/citation/,6sd7f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f59040cdf5dbc01fa13a397/,5f59040cdf5dbc01fa13a397,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6sd7f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6sd7f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6sd7f,NA

The field of empirical research on such media effects is still comparatively young, however, and lacks studies examining precise measures of the media environment an individual is likely to be actually exposed to. We employ a nuanced research design which analyses individual differences in the yearly levels of both media salience and attitudes in panel data of 25,000 persons, who were at least interviewed twice, and a time span over 15 years, from 2001 to 2015. We find a substantive and stable positive effect: comparing periods of vivid discussions with times where the issue was hardly discussed in the German media results in an increase in the predicted probability of being very concerned by about 13 percentage points. Deeper investigations reveal that the media effect is most potent for individuals living in areas with lower share of ethnic minorities and for those with lower education or conservative ideology, stressing the importance of individual receptiveness. In sum, our findings strengthen the line of reasoning stressing the importance of discursive influences on public opinion and cast doubt on the argument that threat perceptions stem primarily from the size of ethnic out-groups.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|discourse|fixed effects|Germany|immigration|mass media|panel data|public opinion,2020-09-09T18:12:21.155939,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-09T18:11:58.343830,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/citation/,xqy63,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y254k/,y254k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f58a0644f1e5e01fb6f1511/,5f58a0644f1e5e01fb6f1511,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqy63/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xqy63/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xqy63,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcy019

Our results show that, in general, people were most concerned about social contacts and childcare. However, we find clear differences among genders: women worried more about childcare while men were more concerned about paid work and the economy. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting women more heavily than men not only at the physical level of work (e.g. women are reducing more paid work hours than men), but also through increasing the division regarding the cognitive level of work (e.g. women are more worried about childcare work while men are about paid work).

Changes in the Public Acceptance of Immigrants and Refugees in Germany in the Course of Europe’s ""Immigration Crisis""","Based on an innovative design, combining a multi-factorial survey experiment with a longitudinal perspective, we examine changes in the public acceptance of immigrants in Germany from the beginning of the so-called ‘migration crisis’ to after the sexual assaults of New Year’s Eve (NYE) 2015/2016. In contrast to previous studies investigating similar research questions, our approach allows to differentiate changes along various immigrant characteristics. Derived from discussions making up the German immigration discourse during this time, we expect reduced acceptance especially of those immigrants who were explicitly connected to the salient events, like Muslims and the offenders of NYE. Most strikingly, we find that refugees were generally highly accepted and even more so in the second wave, whereas the acceptance of immigrants from Arab or African countries further decreased. Moreover, female respondents’ initial preference for male immigrants disappeared. Contrary to our expectations, we find no changes in the acceptance of Muslims.

Yet, the ability of social scientists to study culture is limited by currently available measurement instruments. Scholars of culture must regularly choose between scalable but sparse survey-based methods or restricted but rich ethnographic methods. Here, we demonstrate that massive online social networks can advance the study of human culture by providing quantitative, scalable, and high-resolution measurement of behaviorally revealed cultural values and preferences. We employ publicly available data across nearly 60,000 topic dimensions drawn from two billion Facebook users across 225 countries and territories. The data capture preferences inferred by Facebook from online behaviours on the platform, behaviors on external websites and apps, and offline behaviours captured by smartphones and other devices. We first validate that cultural distances calculated from this measurement instrument correspond to survey-based and objective measures of cultural differences. We then demonstrate that this measure enables insight into the cultural landscape globally at previously impossible resolution. We analyze the importance of national borders in shaping culture and explore unique cultural markers that identify subnational population groups. The global collection of massive data on human behavior provides a high-dimensional complement to traditional cultural metrics, potentially enabling novel insight into fundamental questions in the social sciences.

While prior analysts have offered “top-down” explanations of academic leaders expanding criteria of merit to accommodate institutional self-interests, we identify a “bottom-up” mechanism: the application essay. Integrating insights from several strands of sociological theory, we posit that the essays required by schools with selective admissions sustain merit’s breadth by enlisting young people (and their families, teachers, and consultants) in collaborative performances of what might be considered meritorious. Analyzing essay prompts and utilizing human readings and statistical analyses of 220,062 essays contributed by 55,016 applicants to a public US university system, we find circumscribed genre expectations and class-correlated patterns of self-presentation but also substantial range in what the university and its applicants invoke as evidence to support competitive bids for admission.

Since then, many families have found themselves spending an unprecedented amount of time together, with some facing the additional challenge of adapting to changes in who they are living with as some families have found themselves unexpectedly brought back together. School and university closures, the move to remote working, furlough or the loss of employment have all meant that many adult children who had previously left the parental home have returned. Other individuals have moved to provide care and support for a family member or friend who has been ‘shielding’, and conversely some vulnerable and/or older people have moved in with a younger relative or friend. This paper provides an overview of the changes in living arrangements during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing upon recently available data from five large scale nationally representative surveys, including the second wave of Understanding Society Covid-19 Study, conducted in May 2020 and the special Covid-19 surveys conducted with the participants of the 1958, 1970, 2000-01 British birth cohorts and Next Steps (born in 1989-90). The paper then goes on to explore the impact of the unexpected changes in living arrangements and mental health, as measured by self-reported stress and interpersonal conflict.
Data from the Understanding Society May Covid-19 survey shows that for most of the respondents (95.5%) their living arrangements during the three months since 1st March 2020 had not changed. Just over 2% had changed their address and a further 1.5% reported other people had moved in, whilst under 1% reporting people moving out. However, the likelihood of having changed living arrangements varied significantly by age with one in seven of those aged 20-24 reporting a change in living arrangements. Young people aged 16-29 accounted for over half (57%) of all respondents reporting that they had moved themselves. By contrast, respondents in mid-life (45-59) and early later life (60-74) accounted for the majority of respondents reporting other people had moved in or out. Analysis of the cohort data confirmed this picture with nearly a quarter (24%) of the Millennium Cohort Study, currently aged 19 reporting a change in the people they were living with as a result of covid-19, compared to under one in ten of the 1958 cohort, now aged 62. Logistic regression models were used to assess the odds of reporting increased stress and conflict increase amongst those respondents who had experienced a change in living arrangement change compared to those who had not.  The results provide strong evidence that those individuals whose living arrangements have changed as a result of the covoid-19 pandemic have a higher likelihood of reported increased stress and family conflict than those whose living arrangements remained unchanged. This has important implications for public health and wider policy as prolonged periods of stress can lead to serious health problems and policy makers need to be mindful that services may need to flex to take these new, albeit for many temporary, forms of living into account.",TRUE,FALSE,cohort|Covid-19|family relationships|living arrangements|pandemic|stress,2020-09-09T18:15:13.682891,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-09T18:14:26.009640,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8644-3,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8644-3,prereg_designs,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/citation/,kv8dg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f57dfa39fdada01f29edbf9/,5f57dfa39fdada01f29edbf9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8dg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kv8dg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kv8dg,NA
