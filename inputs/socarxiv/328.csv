There is a big emphasis on learning the new words' meaning from the books or inside classrooms. Also, it is a major part of language teaching as well as being fundamental to the learner but there is a big challenge in vocabulary instruction due to the weak confidence by teachers in selecting the suitable practice in teaching vocabulary or they sometimes unable to specify a suitable time for it during the teaching process. The major aim of this study is to investigate the value of posters in vocabulary learning on the 2nd grade students at Halemat Alsaadia High School in Baghdad – Iraq. It hypothesized that there are no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups' scores in the post-test. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups out of four groups. Group A which represents the control group are taught without using posters, and group B which represents the experimental group is taught by using posters. The whole number of participated students is 62 students. The control group is (32) , and the experimental group is (30) students. Students were subjected to pre and posttests. The researcher used the T-test for two independent samples to know the equivalent between the experimental and control groups in the pre-test. The researcher used chi-square to find out statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups' variables of mothers and fathers' academic achievement. The results of the post-test shown that there are differences between the experimental and control groups for the favor of the experimental group. It is concluded that teaching vocabulary by using posters proved to be more useful for the students of Intermediate school than through taught without using posters. This adequacy of using posters is clear on developing both memorizing and written achievement. The present study suggests that English teachers in Iraq need to activate their students' minds and memorization through using posters and recommends that other researchers to research the effectiveness of Facebook and social media in increasing English language vocabulary learning.",TRUE,FALSE,learning|posters|secondary students|visualized teaching|vocabulary,2020-02-11T17:51:02.194826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:50:31.490858,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/citation/,5a3js,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422bc97610e10034ca4b10/,5e422bc97610e10034ca4b10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5a3js/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5a3js/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5a3js

It aims to reveal the linguistic constructions involved in ironic utterances and to uncover ideologies underpinning such structures. It draws upon the echo and pretense theories to account for utterance representation along with Wodak’s (2007) framework of self and other presentation strategies. The study examines the incongruous construction of an attitude, and the objectives attempted to achieve by taking a cynical stance. The main research questions center on the role played by ironic utterances and how they contribute to preserving the image of the speaker and to the negative representation of the other. The study reveals the way politicians mark their verbal irony, i.e., to classify and categorize the co-textual markers including hyperboles, and repetitive follow-up commentaries. The findings in this study support Bertuccelli (2018) view that irony is not merely saying the opposite of what one means but instead communicating an attitude. It adds to the existing literature that irony involves not a reversal of evaluation, but a reversal of attitudes about social actors to draw a positive self-image. Furthermore, the study shows that echoing the opponent's utterance involves a representation of acts and speech acts along with free direct and indirect speech.",TRUE,FALSE,: discourse|echo|irony|negative other representation|positive self-presentation|pretense,2020-02-11T17:51:23.138834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:50:56.539779,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/citation/,36f5y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422a6a7610e10032ca4814/,5e422a6a7610e10032ca4814,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36f5y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/36f5y/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/36f5y

The medium has evolved to such a degree that evaluation should not rest on whether an individual game can be considered art, but what types of aesthetic engagement the medium affords. A key figure in the study of the visual arts is aesthetic contemplation, in which extended attention reveals aesthetic differences. Although the videogame presents many sites and scenes worthy of such contemplation, this mode of spectatorship requires sufficient time and space to attend to a visual object. In order to open up a space for aesthetic engagement, many of the ludological and narrative demands of the game must recede.

According to the paradox, the tension associated with anticipation and uncertainty persists even though the spectator definitely knows what will happen (Carroll 2001). Many of the articles on the paradox and suspense examine the narrative events shaping spectator or player knowledge (Branigan 1992; Gerrig 1997; Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988; Prieto-Pablos 1998; Smuts 2008; Yanal 1996), however, this paper takes a slightly different approach by addressing factors that contribute to the feeling of suspense irrespective of the awareness of specific narrative events. By examining videogames, we also shift the frame of reference from narration to gameplay and the way players prepare for suspenseful events.

Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, a number of technological, economic, political, and social forces began to collectively undermine the societal terms and conditions under which established professions operate to the extent that it is now possible to speculate that the adaptation mechanisms of several of the professions will prove inadequate for the emerging environment and suggesting that those professions may devolve back into occupations and trades. Harold Wilenskey (1964) examined the development of eighteen professions from the 17th through the 20th centuries and offered a five stage model of professional development. Central to Wilenskey’s model is the formation of a “first collective,” ― in his terminology, a professional association. Using Wilenskey’s general model, this paper will suggest that, under certain conditions, a “second collective” may form in response to an external challenge, and that this formation can be a key initiator of devolutionary processes. A complementary speculative model of profession devolution is then proposed.

Hypothesizing the spatiotemporally heterogeneous association, we employ the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)-based random slope model with the spatiotemporal interaction under the control of common covariates. The model design aims to investigate the spatiotemporally transforming relationship between unemployment rates and mortality rates. The causes for all, self-harm, and mental disorders in 3,108 coterminous counties in the United States for 2001-2014, which includes two economic recessions, are considered. The results show the sporadic spatial effect and the cause-specific change of spatiotemporal interactions during the study period. The spatiotemporal patterns did not only have the same magnitude but also show the same direction of shift for causes of death. The spatiotemporal changes of the associations of one-year lagged unemployment rates are summarized as follows: (1) Dakotas and the west Appalachian counties have highly positive association in recent years; (2) the geographical shifts in high association regions were various for each cause of death: the dividing cluster for all-cause, the southerly moving cluster for the self-harm and interpersonal violence, and intensifying clusters in central and west Appalachian for the mental and substance-use disorders mortality; (3) the associations become weaker during the Great Recession period. Those patterns may be attributed to regional contexts, such as devoid of healthcare facilities and psychological deprivation. Even though there are possible mediating factors indicated by the substantial degree of residuals in some regions, our approach illustrates that the association of unemployment and mortality is spatiotemporally different across regions. It also suggests the spatiotemporal approach is effective in investigating the relationship between unemployment and mortality.",TRUE,FALSE,Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)|Mortality|Spatial inequality|Spatiotemporal interaction|Unemployment,2020-02-10T00:32:02.081052,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-10T00:31:48.313230,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d87|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Other Geography,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/citation/,4shjx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3f7329032a4d0253e73200/,5e3f7329032a4d0253e73200,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4shjx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4shjx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4shjx

Interest in anonymity-granting technologies like the The Onion Router (Tor) has grown substantially as citizens seek to protect their privacy. However, this same technology can be used to engage in illegal activity on the Dark Web. This study examines how interest in the Dark Web, public attention to the 2013 Snowden revelations, and metro area political ideology affect public interest in Tor. We link data from multiple sources including Google Trends, the American Community Survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study for the 49 largest U.S. MSAs from 2006-2015 (n=490). Broadly, we find that metro areas with liberal citizen ideology and greater interest in the Dark Web were more likely to search for Tor. When controlling for the level of interest in the Dark Web, the Snowden revelations of 2013 had no significant impact on interest in Tor. These findings tend to suggest that the lure of the Dark Web and left-leaning ideological contexts offer stronger explanations for interest in anonymity-granting technology than the public attention brought to mass surveillance by the Snowden revelations.",TRUE,FALSE,anonymity-granting technology|Internet|mass surveillance|media sociology|technology,2020-02-09T01:30:22.613497,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-09T01:30:05.985809,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/citation/,3e2vq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cqayu/,cqayu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3efe98f1369e02478abb9b/,5e3efe98f1369e02478abb9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3e2vq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3e2vq/,https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v18i4.13235,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3e2vq
