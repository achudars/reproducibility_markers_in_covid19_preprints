In our analysis, we make use of random variation in the field period of the European Social Survey (ESS) to fashion a natural experimental design. The survey’s field period took place in Germany from August 23, 2016, to March 26, 2017. Hence, the Christmas market attack took place approximately halfway through the ESS’s field phase, thus making it possible to study the causal effect on changing attitudes toward minorities before and after the attack. We argue that the terrorist attack creates a spillover effect and negatively shapes public opinion of uninvolved ethnic minorities. Our data analysis suggests that immediately after the event, only people with a right-wing political attitude appear to be affected by the proposed spillover effect. However, we find that the worsening of attitudes toward refugees can also be observed in the general population as time progresses. We do not find variation according to educational levels.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-22T15:40:42.489675,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22T15:40:13.936490,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Christof Nägel|Mark Lutter,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/citation/,35v6r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wm9pz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/relationships/node/,wm9pz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5bf883bc2a230017860d87/,5d5bf883bc2a230017860d87,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35v6r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/35v6r/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41125-020-00066-w,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/35v6r

The city became a focal point of intensive intellectual debate whose participants regarded Kyiv not only as a place of a recent battleground but also as a sacral place and a highly symbolic image. Within the methodological framework of ethnic symbolism, this study attempts to explain how this physical/symbolic dichotomy was used to reinforce continuing claims for historical origin and cultural heritage, thus serving the contemporary purpose of national identity and political legitimacy. It also deploys the concept of displacement as a complex process of negotiation between homeland and hostland within an émigré community — whose sense of loss and identity crisis creates additional impetus, though in different forms, for exploiting historical narratives.

memories played in forming his poetic imagination. Displaced by World War II, the poet displays a unique capacity to transcend his traumatic experiences by engaging in creative writing. Eyewitnessing war atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis does not destroy his belief in the healing power of poetry; on the contrary, it makes him appreciate poetry as the only existentially worthy enterprise. Invoking Gaston Bachelard’s classic work The Poetics of Reveries: Childhood, Language, and the Cosmos, I argue that Boichuk’s vivid childhood memories, however painful they might be, helped him poetically recreate and reimagine fateful moments of his migrant life.

Academy at the beginning of the 20th century by reconstructing the spiritual biographies of two theological academy professors: Archimandrite (later, Archbishop
of Berlin and Germany) Tykhon (Tymofii Liashchenko) and Petro Kudriavtsev. The article demonstrates how different cultural traditions intersected and combined in
the spiritual experience of these figures. The author of the article argues that, as a result of revolutionary events in 1917–1919, both Kyiv Theological Academy professors experienced transformations in personal cultural identity, and their spiritual biographies reveal a transition from Russian to Western European and a combination of both (Tykhon (Liashchenko) identities), and from Russian to Ukrainian ideological cultural orientation (Petro Kudriavtsev).

A reflection of a qualitative research project-based seminar.,"Openness in science and education is increasing in importance within the digital knowledge society. So far, less attention has been paid to teaching Open Science in bachelor’s degrees or in qualitative methods. Therefore, the aim of this article is to use a seminar example to explore what Open Science practices can be taught in qualitative research and how digital tools can be involved. The seminar focused on the following practices: Open data practices, the practice of using the free and open source tool “Collaborative online Interpretation, the practice of participating, cooperating, collaborating and contributing through participatory technologies and in social (based) networks. To learn Open Science practices, the students were involved in a qualitative research project about “Use of digital technologies for the study and habitus of students”. The study shows the practices of Open Data are easy to teach, whereas the use of free and open source tools and participatory technologies for collaboration, participation, cooperation and contribution is more difficult. In addition, a cultural shift would have to take place within German universities to promote Open Science practices in general.",TRUE,FALSE,Open Education|Open Science|practices|Qualitative Methods|research-based learning|Teaching,2019-08-20T08:53:01.969804,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-20T08:52:45.829553,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/citation/,b3zf7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5aa342ffde5b0018044f7d/,5d5aa342ffde5b0018044f7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3zf7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b3zf7/,https://doi.org/10.3233/EFI-190308,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b3zf7

We argue these construals are responsible for difficulties analysts encounter in conceptualizing the sources and mechanisms behind institutional change. We propose ᴅɪsᴛʀɪʙᴜᴛɪᴏɴ as a more effective foundational metaphor for institutional analysis. From this perspective, institutions are conceived as non-random dispersals of activity and knowledge across people and not as containers encasing persons or substances endowed with an essence. Most of a population may know how to take interactional advantage of an institution but few know how to keep institutions going and are therefore usually powerless to change them. This means those who do have the requisite operational knowledge and engage in the required upkeep activities, whom we refer to as “functionaries,”  play pivotal roles in institutional change and reproduction. We revise theories of institutional entrepreneurship around the role of functionaries, and distinguish between two ideal types of institutional change.",TRUE,FALSE,change|conceptual metaphors|entrepreneurship|functionaries|institutional theory|institutions|theorizing,2019-08-18T03:36:02.336053,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-18T03:35:37.611097,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/citation/,p48ft,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d58c012150734001cc811ed/,5d58c012150734001cc811ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p48ft/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p48ft/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p48ft

DevSim plays out key structural changes studied in development economics. The game is inspired by Sid Meier’s simulators, namely Civilization and Alpha Centauri. It provides a fun way to introduce students to central themes of economic development including industrialization, demographic transition, sources of growth, trade, institutions, diminishing returns when land is a fixed factor, the resource curse, and the importance of productivity. The foundation of the game is a production function, with the class allocating labor and capital to different industries each turn in order to grow their economy.

Sociologists, on the other hand, have extensively studied nationalism, but have only sporadically engaged in debates about institutional politics. In this study, we bring these literatures together by considering how nationalist beliefs shaped respondents' voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how the election outcome built on long-term changes in the distribution of nationalism in the U.S. population. The results suggest that competing understandings of American nationhood were effectively mobilized by candidates from the two parties, both in the 2016 primaries and the general election. Furthermore, over the past twenty years, nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have come to define America in more exclusionary and critical terms and Democrats have increasingly endorsed inclusive and positive conceptions of nationhood. These trends point to the rising demand for radical candidates among Republicans and suggests a potentially bleak future for U.S. politics, as nationalism becomes yet another among multiple overlapping social and cultural cleavages that serve to reinforce partisan divisions and undermine the stability of liberal democratic institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 election|Clinton|cultural sociology|electoral politics|latent class analysis|national identity|nationalism|political communication|political sociology|populism|radical right|Sanders|Trump|word2vec|word embeddings,2019-08-16T14:51:01.914587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-16T14:50:45.074509,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available after publication.,,no,It is not customary to preregister non-experimental research in sociology.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/citation/,pmg95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d56bafeffde5b001affc26e/,5d56bafeffde5b001affc26e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pmg95/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pmg95
