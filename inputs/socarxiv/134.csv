any benefit to them. In Japan, organized fraud has been a serious issue, accounting for almost half of the total financial damage by all property crimes. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate that (i) the YEOs increase the revenue from organized fraud and (ii) the YEOs’ effects are greater in regions with lower concentration levels of yakuza syndicates.

While crisis intervention is appropriate for these scenarios, historical definitions of crisis suggest the term and related interventions have much broader application. The ramifications of the novel coronavirus and related cultural fallout increase vulnerability and impair coping capacity in such a way that individuals are significantly more likely to enter crisis states, demanding a prompt reconsideration of the breadth of this practice technique. Successful application of crisis intervention reduces the long-term psychological implications for individuals encountering sudden loss, unexpected traumas, and other hazards that overwhelm traditional coping strategies, outcomes all made more likely by this pandemic. Crisis intervention is a structured, time-limited, problem-oriented treatment modality that is well suited to a remote practice environment because it is directive in its approach and requires few contacts at a time when client access is potentially limited.

Further, recent studies show that intergenerational social class mobility at the societal level is beneficial for population health. Using representative survey data from 30 European countries (N = 159,591), we present the first study to investigate the role that intergenerational class mobility both at the individual and societal level play for self-rated health. We find that, apart from four post-communist countries, neither downward nor upward mobility is significantly and systematically related to poor self-rated health. There is also no association between societal-level social mobility and the prevalence of poor self-rated health across the 30 societies.

In what we term the “Room for Error Hypothesis,” our findings suggest that—though barrier-breaking candidates do not necessarily face stiffer electoral sanctions—they are less able to withstand even diminished penalties given lower baseline support. Further, we hypothesize that gay candidates received lessened penalties from Republicans when charged with norm violation due to “counter-stereotypic” effects: since norm violations send a signal of candidate conservatism to Republicans, this traditionally “negative” candidate quality works to counteract the perception of non-traditional candidates as liberal.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|LGBT|politics|scandal,2020-08-15T22:39:36.689283,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-15T22:39:04.171725,FALSE,NA,no,Please email akhil.rajan [at] yale.edu for data,,available,NA,https://osf.io/a8xkz/,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/citation/,swckv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f36a3603bf2520083a2080b/,5f36a3603bf2520083a2080b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swckv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/swckv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/swckv,NA

Yet, the effects of media campaigns are difficult to study because citizens self-select into media consumption. Using a quasi-experiment – the 30-years boycott of the most important Eurosceptic tabloid newspaper, The Sun, in Merseyside caused by the Hillsborough soccer disaster – we identify the effects of The Sun boycott on attitudes towards leaving the EU. Difference-in-differences designs using public opinion data spanning three decades, supplemented by referendum results, show that the boycott caused EU attitudes to become more positive in treated areas. This effect is driven by cohorts socialized under the boycott, and by working class voters who stopped reading The Sun. Our findings have implications for our understanding of public opinion, media influence, and ways to counter such influence, in contemporary democracies.",TRUE,FALSE,Euroscepticism|media|media effect|political communication|political science|public opinion,2020-08-15T22:39:00.729442,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-15T22:38:34.331618,FALSE,NA,no,"Analysis is based on the British Social Attitudes (BSA) data to which access is restricted.

Why, then, do parties not emphasize certain hot-button issues symmetrically? This paper argues that in order to answer this question, social scientists must study attitudes at three levels: (1) the aggregate, (2) between-party, and (3) within-party. Each level provides necessary information for understanding party strategy toward issues and the broader consequences of public opinion for institutional politics. Using several waves of ANES data between 1992 and 2016, I apply this analytic strategy to immigration—one of the most salient issues in U.S. and European politics—to understand why Democrats, unlike Republicans, have not touted immigration as a central issue of the party. The results suggest that Democrats may be reluctant to run on immigration because substantial intra-party disagreement make this strategy too risky; on the other hand, touting immigration poses little risk to a uniform Republican party and provides much upside in their potential to “wedge"" a divided Democratic party. I conclude by discussing the consequences of within-party variation for our understanding of party coalitions and electoral strategy.",TRUE,FALSE,Immigration Attitudes|Polarization|Political Sociology|Within-party polarization,2020-08-15T22:36:17.018655,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-15T22:35:51.579763,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://electionstudies.org/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Sean Bock,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/citation/,3atq7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f35658bd42ad4006acdae62/,5f35658bd42ad4006acdae62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3atq7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3atq7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3atq7,NA
