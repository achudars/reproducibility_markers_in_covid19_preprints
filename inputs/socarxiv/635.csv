Building on Pettigrew and Tropp’s (2006) influential meta-analysis, we assemble all intergroup contact studies that feature random assignment and delayed outcome measures, of which there are 27 in total, nearly two-thirds of which were published following the original review. We find the evidence from this updated dataset to be consistent with Pettigrew and Tropp’s (2006) conclusion that contact “typically reduces prejudice."" At the same time, our meta-analysis suggests that contact’s effects vary, with interventions directed at ethnic or racial prejudice generating substantially weaker effects. Moreover, our inventory of relevant studies reveals important gaps, most notably the absence of studies addressing adults’ racial or ethnic prejudice, an important limitation for both theory and policy. We also call attention to the lack of research that systematically investigates the scope conditions suggested by Allport (1954) under which contact is most influential. We conclude that these gaps in contact research must be addressed empirically before this hypothesis can reliably guide policy.",TRUE,FALSE,computational reproducibility|contact hypothesis|economics|intergroup contact|meta-analysis|#O3S17|political science|prejudice|prejudice reduction|psychology|reproducibility,2018-07-02T10:58:10.566535,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-24T18:43:06.400818,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/citation/,w2jkf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h465x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/relationships/node/,h465x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5925d33f9ad5a102513e46f7/,5925d33f9ad5a102513e46f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2jkf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w2jkf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w2jkf,NA

Ranging from social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, to mobile apps such as Buycott, and to data sharing wiki platforms and hacktivist projects, the activist landscape is rapidly shifting, collapsing geographic boundaries to form new issue publics and fast, sometimes mercurial, collective action. Within these emerging digital platforms for activism, food-related consumer action is gaining new contours and publics. In this paper, we explore the emerging field of digital food activism. Focusing on three case studies – a mobile app, a wiki platform, and an online-centric activist organization – we examine how activist–ICT interactions generate new knowledges and practices in relation to consumer-based food activism. Specifically, we critically analyse how consumer activists and social entrepreneurs use ICTs to facilitate new or alternative forms of engagement with food, and how ICTs, in turn, shape possibilities for action.

In particular, at least some evidence exists suggesting that breastfed children perform better on measures of intelligence later in life.  While a correlation appears to be present, fewer observational studies have included appropriate adjustment for potentially confounding variables; maternal intelligence, maternal education, and cognitive stimulation provided by mothers being chief among them.  As a result, we analyze a national sample of approximately 790 American respondents in order to test the association between breastfeeding and intelligence during childhood and adolescence using multiple intelligence tests and controlling for a range of key covariates.  Our results suggest that the correlation between breastfeeding throughout the first six months of life and intelligence is statistically significant and consistent, yet of substantively minor impact.

In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. We find that #AllLivesMatter facilitates opposition between #BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such as #PoliceLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes the tension between Black protesters and law enforcement. In addition, we show that a significant portion of #AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by #BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply injecting #AllLivesMatter with #BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confront the counter-protest notion of ""All lives matter.""

This paper is not the copy of record and does not exactly replicate the final, authoritative version of the article. Please do not copy or cite without permission of the author.                                                                                        As a social problem, little is known about how individuals are portrayed in the news when race/ethnicity and mental illness intersect. This is important because of the ability of news to influence perceptions and policies about mental illness across race/ethnicity. This article examines how individuals with mental illness who were killed by police during 2015 and 2016 were portrayed in the news. Content analysis of 301 online news articles indicates that stereotypes associated with mental illness were differentially applied by race/ethnicity.

By depending on standard human-generated code, many statistical software programs commonly used in economics and the social sciences inadvertently rely on the human willpower of scientists, and inspite of an assumed invincibility, such individuals are nearly necessarily prone to errors and research integrity compromises, as is increasingly clear. Removing the vast majority of arbitrary and subjective data judgments, including the generation of code, from researcher control would free behavioural and social scientists from human limitations.  Automating the text annotations that accompany data visualizations in figures and diagrams using emerging natural language processing tools can also free scientists from overconfidence or the temptation to embellish findings. Scientific communities across economics as well as other social science fields should embrace such systems to enhance the integrity and transparency of the next-generation of research.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioral economics|ethics|human-computer interaction|Occam's razor|transparency,2018-07-02T10:58:09.031718,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-18T04:19:09.667685,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/citation/,ra3cs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nbkp9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/relationships/node/,nbkp9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591d2044b83f69024f8dd877/,591d2044b83f69024f8dd877,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ra3cs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ra3cs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ra3cs,NA

With an emphasis on the implementation of the Schengen acquis—the EU’s common policies on cooperation in law enforcement, visas, and the management of its borders--this article begins with an examination of the ways in which third country nationals are categorized as a group separate from EU citizens.  This article then explores how the everyday presence of the border between Słubice and Frankfurt(Oder) excluded third country nationals from the exercise of EU citizenship through practices that placed limits on their freedom of movement.  Finally, this article describes how specific individuals responded to these limitations by strategically managing their visa and citizenship statuses.

Because of the cities’ unique border location, the residents of Słubice/Frankfurt(Oder) demonstrate the development of unequal citizenship regimes for EU citizens and non-citizens, in which each group is extended differential access to the entitlements, privileges, and rights of citizenship.  By exploring how third country nationals’ ability to exercise citizenship rights were structured and constrained by EU laws and regulations, this article documents the emergence of one instance of illiberality within the EU’s ostensibly neoliberal and democratic economic and political projects, and brings into sharp relief the central role the right to free movement plays in the exercise of full citizenship within the EU.",TRUE,FALSE,Citizenship|Citizenship Regimes|EU Citizenship|Germany|Poland|Schengen Acquis,2018-07-02T10:58:08.753075,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-17T18:55:46.874153,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/citation/,mbjhk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uenfk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/relationships/node/,uenfk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591c9c00594d90024f89980c/,591c9c00594d90024f89980c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbjhk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mbjhk,NA

Our matching approach takes into account pre-event confounders that are both time-independent and time-dependent, as well as life course trajectories. After matching, treated and control individuals can be compared using standard statistical tests or regression models. We apply our approach to the study of the consequences of the age at retirement on subsequent health outcomes, using a unique dataset from Swedish administrative registers. Once selectivity in the timing of retirement is taken into account, effects on hospitalization are small, while early retirement has negative effects on survival. Our approach also allows for heterogeneous treatment effects. We show that the effects of early retirement differ according to pre-retirement income, with higher income individuals tending to benefit from early retirement, while the opposite is true for individuals with lower income.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:58:08.692538,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-17T09:27:10.867296,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/citation/,rqwpf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/68znv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/relationships/node/,68znv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591c1622594d90024fc3848b/,591c1622594d90024fc3848b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rqwpf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rqwpf,NA
