The current study aims at exploring teachers’ knowledge about the general concepts of creative thinking and its related skills. Moreover, the study attempts to investigate teachers’ perceptions about creativity and its incorporation in the English foreign language (EFL) Classroom. To examine these issues, a questionnaire was administered to twenty-seven EFL teachers from the English department of Badji Mokhtar university, Algeria.

Further, there is a need to investigate the linguistic email communication problems that Saudis encounter when they study abroad. This study aims to identify the dominant features of email communication of twenty Saudi and Australian post-graduate students with their lecturers. The research sought to understand the following: to what extent negotiation moves differ from one group to another;  if there is a significant difference between the two raters when rating native speakers (NS) versus non-native speakers (NNS); whether there is a significant relationship between students’ scores and total number of words used in negotiation moves; the most important moves that might have affected the raters’ decisions when giving the highest scores versus the lowest scores;  and whether there is difference between total scores of NS and NNS. Whereas the qualitative analysis employed (im)politeness as the theoretical framework, the quantitative analysis focused on the moves used by students in terms of  context, proposal, justification, options, and  requests. It was found that NS and NNS had similar likelihoods of gaining higher grades when using more details. When both NS and NNS failed to employ a focus-on-context move, they were likely to fail in their negotiations. International students need to be encouraged to give more detailed explanations to improve their negotiation techniques.

As one observes the multitude of current global conflicts, one questions why humanity has not been able to move beyond petty grievances to achieve the equitable global harmony and citizenship that Aurelius aspired to so long ago. Motivated by the purpose of improving academic, economic, and social equity, this exploratory essay examines historic and current North American pedagogical theories of culturally responsive teaching practices with the juxtapositional purpose of examining and evaluating the best method for minimizing Drs.

Participants included 118 EFL learners at Sulaymaniyah University in Iraq, all of whom were studying in the School of Basic-Education English Department. Two instruments were employed to collect data: a VLS questionnaire designed by Schmitt (1997) was administered in order to determine the range and frequency of VLS use, and a four-level (2000, 3000, 5000 and academic word list) vocabulary learning test (VLT) designed by Schmitt, et al. (2001) was used to measure learners’ receptive vocabulary size. The aim of this study was to determine the kinds of strategies learners utilized as well as their  relationship to students’ VS. The results demonstrated that students utilized consolidation more frequently than discovery strategies. Moreover, the most frequently utilized VLS was studying the sounds of new words, while the least frequent one was working in groups to discover the meanings of new words. In terms of total VLS, the students can be considered as moderate VLS users (M= 3.003). The results of correlation analysis revealed that there exist positive, negative and sometimes no relationships between learners’ VLS and VS.

The study follows a quasi- experimental design in which an experimental group and a control group were purposefully chosen from eleventh grade students at Al Hashymiah School for Boys, Zarqa in Jordan during the second semester of the academic year 2016/2017. In the experimental group, 20 students were taught by mind mapping strategy and 20 students of control group were taught by the conventional teaching method as outlined in the Teacher’s Book. To collect the data, a pre-test and a post-test was utilized. ANCOVA was used to measure statistical differences in the mean scores of the participants of the study. The findings reveal statistically significant differences (at α≤0.05) between the two mean scores of experimental and control groups in the post- test in favor of experimental group.

How native English speaking teachers influence the participants’ learning behaviours and motivation to learn English are also perceptually reported. Two research instruments, the survey questionnaire and the semi-structured interview, are employed for this study. The findings indicate overall positive perceptions towards native English speaking teachers, pointing that their classes are mostly fun, interactive and motivating. The flexible and interactive teaching methods and styles used by native English speaking teachers are found to be most favoured, followed by their approachable personality traits and the students’ vast opportunity to practice oral and written English. Most participants, if given an option to choose a teacher, have a salient preference to study with native English speaking teachers in which case neither teachers’ age nor gender matters. There seems to be a strong relationship between studying with native English speaking teachers and the participants’ learning behaviours and motivation to learn English.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL|Learning Behaviours|Native English Speaking Teachers|Perceptions|University Students,2018-07-02T11:31:09.474184,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:20:55.367555,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/citation/,d7jcf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9hrgj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/relationships/node/,9hrgj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45b39f67d19e000d6c6f02/,5a45b39f67d19e000d6c6f02,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7jcf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d7jcf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d7jcf

The historical evolution of teacher leadership through various phases gives useful insights into how this concept has emerged, developed and perceived in different educational contexts and how it appears in today’s institutions around the world. The definitions of teacher leadership delineate various features of teachers’ roles, responsibilities and their expected contribution to organisational effectiveness while operating in a wide range of formal and informal leadership roles. Review of the literature also shows the significance of leadership knowledge and skills for the academic leadership positions that need to be fostered in a school context.  Moreover, it highlights factors that might hinder the emergence of teacher leadership in academic institutions. The last section of this paper indicates a void in the literature on the issue of teacher leadership in the field of Teaching of English to the Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) that also directs researchers’ endeavours towards investigating this concept in the context of English language teaching.",TRUE,FALSE,Leadership knowledge and skills|teacher leadership in TESOL|teacher leadership roles,2018-07-02T11:31:09.429088,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:21:30.845849,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/citation/,3rycz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/er3ba/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/relationships/node/,er3ba,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45b182b794960013afc6c7/,5a45b182b794960013afc6c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rycz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3rycz/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3rycz

The research design utilized multiple semi-structured, recorded interviews. The participants’ responses were grouped and analyzed through a reflection framework comprised by Hatton and Smith (1995), which discusses four types of reflections: technical, descriptive, dialogic, and critical. The findings revealed that most participants understood the concept of reflection in education similarly rather than differently. Second, the results showed that the most frequently produced single reflection type was descriptive, followed by technical, dialogic and critical. Overall, all 10 participants produced different single as well as hybrid reflection types, which was a rather important finding of this study as hybrid reflections have not yet been thoroughly explored in the research literature. The use of hybrid reflections also indicated that reflective thinking is not a linear process that can be easily categorized based on a certain reflection type. Third, the study describes a few characteristics of highly and less reflective participants. The main teaching implication entails a need for the organization of seminars focused on introducing and exploring the impact of different types of reflections on EFL teaching in higher education.",TRUE,FALSE,education|English|reflection|teacher|university,2018-07-02T11:31:09.394051,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:23:06.441590,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/citation/,v4b56,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qhs3c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/relationships/node/,qhs3c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45b07e67d19e000d6c6d69/,5a45b07e67d19e000d6c6d69,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4b56/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v4b56/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v4b56
