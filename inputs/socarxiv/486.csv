Racial Disparities in Police Use of Force During Investigatory Stops","Black civilians are more likely to be stopped by police than White civilians net of relevant factors. Less is known about whether or not racial inequalities exist in police use of force during stops. Using data on over two million police stops in New York City from 2007-2014 and drawing on literatures on race, policing, and the Black Lives Matter movement, we test hypotheses regarding the associations between race, civilian behavior, age, and police use of force. We also investigate whether recent reforms reduced any observed inequality in police violence during stops. Findings show that Black and White civilians experience fundamentally different interactions with police. Black civilians are particularly more likely to experience potential lethal force when police uncover criminal activity and this disparity is greatest for Black youth compared to White youth. Overall, if there were no racial disparities in police use of force, we estimate that approximately 61,000 fewer stops of Black civilians would have included police use of force and 1,000 fewer stops would have included potential lethal force from 2007-2014. Further, while reform efforts substantially reduced the number of stops annually, inequalities in police use of force persist.",TRUE,FALSE,police use of force|police violence|policing|race|racial disparities|stop and frisk,2019-02-08T20:32:01.828342,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T20:30:34.419936,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/citation/,dfvgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5ddee976653c001b2e178c/,5c5ddee976653c001b2e178c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dfvgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dfvgs/,https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12366,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dfvgs

UCCities Working Paper # 1,"While many urban scholars acknowledge the importance of justice and participation for emerging smart city initiatives, these dimensions remain inadequately addressed in critical literature. To strengthen the smart city critique, in this conceptual intervention we employ the theory of justice developed by philosopher Nancy Fraser, organized along the domains of redistribution, recognition, and representation. Using Fraser’s tripartite framework of justice, we reformulate and expand the existing critiques of the smart city. Moreover, drawing on her notion of transformative approaches, we argue for shifting the discussion away from the smart city, even an alternative one, towards the just city and a just urbanism in the digital age.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital Age|Nancy Fraser|Smart City|Social Justice|UCCities|Urban Geography|Urban Studies,2019-02-08T21:59:44.939486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T20:43:11.198038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/citation/,wkqy2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7sdxe/,7sdxe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5dd600832ca60019aadfa8/,5c5dd600832ca60019aadfa8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wkqy2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wkqy2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wkqy2

Indeed, over the last decades scientific integrity became a hot issue in science policy (Tchao, 2014). Moreover, papers retracted for fraud or other reasons should not be cited or used anymore. Although in most cases they are earmarked as retracted in bibliographic databases and in the electronic version of journals, they often remain cited a long time after the retraction notice is published. The misconduct case of Jan Hendrik Schön is a well know example. It attracted a lot of attention due to the renown of the researcher’s institute, the claims and the sheer number of publications involved. This researcher co-authored more than 100 papers and rose through prominence at the turn of the century with a number of apparent ground breaking discoveries in materials science.

The sample of the study consisted of 132 randomly-selected EFL preparatory year instructors at Al-Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, and King Saud University in Riyadh city. Three instruments were utilized to collect data for the study: the first one was a questionnaire, the second was semi-structured interviews, and the third one was lectures observations. The researcher designed a five-point Likert scale questionnaire to collect the data of the study which was validated by a panel of raters consisting of ten university professors and instructors. To ensure reliability, Cronbach Alpha formula was calculated. Besides, The findings of the study revealed that the causes of Saudi EFL university instructors’ barriers to teaching the speaking skill in the preparatory year were as follows: students’ use of L1 during group work or pair work, lack of vocabulary, fear of making mistakes, lack of self-confidence, and lack of motivation. Furthermore, the study results advocated the following solutions to Saudi EFL university instructors’ barriers to teaching the speaking skill: enhancing students’ self-confidence to speak without fear, correcting students’ mistakes kindly, meeting students’ needs in speaking textbooks, and adopting recent motivating techniques, increasing the motivating speaking activities in textbooks, and testing the speaking skill.

To conduct the analysis, the researcher selected a sample covering the preamble and the three main parts of the Convention representing legal texts in general. Throughout the analysis, every translation shift was traced and manually counted to identify the most frequent type of translation shifts. The inevitability of each of the identified shifts was examined to conclude how necessary translation shifts were to preserve the meaning and effect of the source text. The findings indicated that intra-system shifts were the most frequent type of shifts with the frequency of 174 shifts (=26.6%), followed by unit shifts scoring 171 shifts (=26.3%), then structure shifts with the frequency of 161 shifts (=24.6%), then class shifts being identified 128 times (=19.6%), and finally level shifts with the frequency of 19 shifts (=2.9%). Regarding the inevitability of resorting to translation shifts, 80.1% (=523 cases) of identified translation shifts were obligatory due to the linguistic disparities between English and Arabic.

In general, it is a space and place study. The thesis suggests that, Antoinette has some conditions and circumstances that she developed in an autonomic manner with different experiences in order to navigate and recognize the dangerous and safe spaces around her. Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys, elaborates a self-sacrifice experience that the protagonist went through in her search for identity, which she lost due to the circumstances around her. In this research, a psychological analysis of Antoinette's personality will be taken, moreover; an attempt is made to find out the reasons for her schizophrenic behavior. The research focuses on Antoinette's shattered identity and the specters she faced in her life, which ultimately played a huge role in her madness. Also, the visible opposite aspects of black/white, rationality/unconsciousness, male/female, and sanity/madness are conceived by her conscious mind, and it causes the frantic thoughts of insanity, womanhood, and blackness. Also, it sheds light on Antoinette's journey in life to figure out where she belongs and her struggle in this search. Antoinette's personality and identity crisis as a Creole girl will be discussed in depth. There are different areas that are explored in this paper; such as the interpretation of how the surrounding spaces affect Antoinette and the reasons behind the absence of a loving mother in Wide Sargasso Sea. Furthermore, Rochester's character is also examined to find out how the masculine space differs from feminine space, and to what extent Mr. Rochester's cruelty harms Antoinette. Another important thing that is discussed in the paper is the effect of family relationships on a person's identity, and how it becomes a reason of mental disorder.",TRUE,FALSE,Black|Identity|Madness|Schizophrenic behavior|Spaces|White,2019-07-20T21:26:05.014568,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:25:40.088984,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/citation/,dsgxj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5cfdbb76653c001b2cc625/,5c5cfdbb76653c001b2cc625,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dsgxj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.228,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dsgxj

The Role of Emotion, Race, and Politics in Social Movement Perceptions and Support","Scholars have long studied how social movements frame and deliver their messages, yet much less is known about how these “signals” are received by the public. In this study, we ask whether and how social movement members’ characteristics interact with a bystander’s to influence whether they support a particular protest movement. In addition, we examine how perceived likelihood of violence mediates these outcomes. We test five competing models based on previous theories of emotion, race, and political views in social movement support. To adjudicate between these frameworks, we conduct an experiment using a 2x2 factorial design in which participants read a news story about a protest accompanied by an image of a neutral/angry, white/Black protestor, measuring three types of social movement support. Results provide support for the politicized race model: a Black protestor is more motivating for liberals’ social movement support, while a white protestor is more motivating for conservatives. Both liberals and conservatives are more likely to associate the protest with violence after seeing a Black protestor compared to a white one. Racialized perceptions of violence explain part of conservatives’ hesitancy to support the movement when seeing a Black protestor and inhibits part of the otherwise-positive effect of seeing a Black protestor for liberals.",TRUE,FALSE,culture and cognition|emotions|politics|race and ethnicity|social movements,2019-02-08T14:20:07.607190,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T13:45:44.384225,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Lauren Valentino &amp; D.

However, the practitioners' perspective on relevance has received very little scholarly attention to date. This paper puts forward a theoretical model for examining how practitioners construct academic knowledge as practically relevant based on interviews with practitioners enrolled on executive MBA (EMBA) courses. The model shows that practitioners construct academic knowledge as relevant by (1) perceiving it as congruent with their context, experiences and intuition, (2) extending their knowledge by new instruments, constructs, and means of scientific framing and (3) reconnecting it to their contexts and professional practices. This model extends the literature by showing that, in order to be considered practically relevant, academic knowledge needs to balance novelty and continuity. Additionally, the paper shows that practitioners are unlikely to perceive as relevant ambiguous academic knowledge that is 'action expansive', i.e. that presents them with an overwhelming range of possible actions.",TRUE,FALSE,mangement education|Practical relevance,2019-02-08T14:14:29.063773,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T13:43:47.700991,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Violetta Splitter,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/citation/,v4su8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5c48d6832ca60017ad90a6/,5c5c48d6832ca60017ad90a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v4su8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v4su8
