Relational Landscapes in the Time of Same-Sex Marriage,"This paper is a pre-print version of the introduction chapter to the edited volume, Queer Families and Relationships After Marriage Equality, published with Routledge in 2018. As same-sex marriage has become a legal reality in a rapidly growing list of countries, the time has come to assess what this means for families and relationships on the ground. Many scholars have already begun to examine how marriage is helping some same-sex couples, but in this introduction I call for a broader and more critical research agenda. In particular, I argue that same-sex marriage crystallizes a key tension surrounding families and relationships in many contemporary societies. On the one hand, strict family norms are relaxing in many places, allowing more people to form more diverse types of caring relationships. On the other hand, some relationships continue to be more honored and protected than others. I frame the spread of same-sex marriage as an opportunity to study this tension, and I argue that queer critiques of marriage provide useful tools for helping ground such research. I argue for research that sees same-sex marriage not as an isolated shift in the status of some same-sex couples, but instead as embedded in broader “relational landscapes” where different relationships of different types intersect with each other and shape each other. Such research would highlight inequalities among married couples and between married and unmarried people, and it would trace changes in other relationship forms outside of same-sex marriage itself. I describe how the chapters in this volume pursue these goals, helping develop queer and other critiques of marriage to lay the groundwork for a contextualized, critical research program on families and relationships after same-sex marriage.

Using an iterative design process, I work with teacher educators to gauge interest in and build a new teacher education model that simplifies how teacher educators interact with rich media. The new model builds on Teacher Moments, an online simulator for preservice teachers, and takes advantage of state of the art speech recognition and data visualization technology to help teacher educators learn the contents of rich media generated by teacher candidates without dedicating the time to listen or watch media. In my investigation, I find that there is an interest in such a model and that the new model succeeds in empowering teacher educators with the ability to use teacher candidate data to inform instructional decisions and substantiate discussion point during group debrief sessions.",TRUE,FALSE,Practice-Based Teacher Education Models|Rich Media|Teacher Moments|Teaching Systems Lab,2018-08-06T18:59:25.339640,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-06T18:59:10.082439,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/citation/,afb46,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/upzsg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/relationships/node/,upzsg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b685f287e433e001805a686/,5b685f287e433e001805a686,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/afb46/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/afb46/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/afb46,NA

Here I report cross-cultural patterns in these beliefs and propose a theory to explain them. Using the newly-created Survey of Mystical Harm, I show that several conceptions of evil, mystical practitioners recur around the world, including sorcerers (who use learned spells), possessors of the evil eye (who transmit injury through their stares and words), and witches (who possess superpowers, pose existential threats, and engage in morally abhorrent acts). I argue that these beliefs develop from three cultural selective processes – a selection for effective-seeming magic, a selection for plausible explanations of impactful misfortune, and a selection for demonizing myths that justify mistreatment. Separately, these selective schemes produce traditions as diverse as shamanism, conspiracy theories, and campaigns against heretics – but around the world, they jointly give rise to the odious and feared witch. I use the tripartite theory to explain the forms of beliefs in mystical harm and outline ten predictions for how shifting conditions should affect those conceptions. Societally-corrosive beliefs can persist when they are intuitively appealing or serve some believers’ agendas.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|evil eye|magic|sorcerer|sorcery|witch|witchcraft,2018-08-06T18:12:41.181711,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-06T18:12:16.096638,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Folklore|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/citation/,pbwc7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bmcyz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/relationships/node/,bmcyz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b67c88d2ce076001c2efe3d/,5b67c88d2ce076001c2efe3d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwc7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pbwc7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pbwc7,NA

Five years after the Declaration and almost a decade after the First BRICS Summit, the evaluation of the strengthening of international cooperation among countries remains a challenge, due to their low presence in the large index databases commonly used for the collection of scientific data, such as Web of Science and Scopus. The proposal of this research is to carry out a study on international cooperation among the countries in the last five years through the Dimensions platform, based on the incidence of international co-authoring and co-financing of research agencies from the five countries, seeking to highlight the following points: the networks that consolidate themselves from the international cooperation among the BRICS countries, areas emerging in research with incidences of co-authorship, and how the research networks have been developed around the five strategic areas defined in the BRICS Cape Town Declaration. It aims to evaluate how the international cooperation of the BRICS bloc in strategic thematic areas has been growing, pointing to possible areas of strengthening of international partnerships that can be deployed through this study.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-04T19:05:05.233762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T19:04:39.453441,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/citation/,b6x43,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pfzth/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/relationships/node/,pfzth,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6571ff7e433e001503f754/,5b6571ff7e433e001503f754,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6x43/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b6x43/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b6x43,NA

This process of collective centering works as an effective “exclusionary practice” that I argue hinders both the scholarly and political potential of this field. This article examines the transformation of the status of the subfield alongside an examination of women’s contributions to feminist scholarship on masculinities, and an emergent politics of citation that works to reproduce inequality within this subfield. In addition to identifying the processes by which a small group of white men have accumulated a disproportionate amount of power and status within “masculinities studies” as problematic, I also question the lack of critical dialogue and debate between various subfields examining systems of power and structured advantage. Here, I put masculinities studies into conversation with whiteness studies, critical heterosexualities studies, research on elites, and more to argue that there should be more dialogue between scholars doing research in these areas. Disrupting exclusionary practices in masculinities studies with both political and practical intent will better situate feminist scholars of masculinities to adapt their scholarship to transformations in the character and form of durable systems of inequality as well as identifying emergent processes and mechanisms of social reproduction.",TRUE,FALSE,hegemonic masculinity|masculinities|masculinities studies|politics of citation,2018-08-04T19:03:01.486198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T19:02:38.317910,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Sage,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/citation/,kvxsj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d69tn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/relationships/node/,d69tn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6543407e433e001803c7d7/,5b6543407e433e001803c7d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvxsj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kvxsj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kvxsj,https://doi.org/10.1177/1097184X18805547
