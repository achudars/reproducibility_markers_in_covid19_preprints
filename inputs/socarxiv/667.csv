Ultimately—as I have discussed elsewhere—resistance to the Digital Revolution can be seen as a response to Baudrillard’s call to a return to prodigality beyond the structural scarcity of the capitalistic market economy. In Baudrillard’s terms, by increasingly commodifying knowledge and expanding copyright protection, we are taming limitless power with artificial scarcity to keep in place a dialectic of penury and unlimited need. In this paper, I will focus on certain global movements that do resist copyright expansion, such as creative commons, the open access movement, the Pirate Party, the A2K movement and cultural environmentalism. A nuanced discussion of these campaigns must account for the irrelevance of copyright in the public mind, the emergence of new economics of digital content distribution in the Internet, the idea of the death of copyright, and the demise of traditional gatekeepers. Scholarly and market alternatives to traditional copyright merit consideration here, as well. I will conclude my review of this movement “resisting the resistance” to the Digital Revolution by sketching out a roadmap for copyright reform that builds upon its vision.",TRUE,FALSE,Baudrillard|copyright|creative commons|digital revolution|digitization|internet|open access|piracy|reconciliation|reform|resistance|Shumpeter,2018-07-02T11:14:58.926257,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-09T02:50:45.881994,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/citation/,nfjm7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tyu57/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/relationships/node/,tyu57,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59dae38c6c613b02b25f13dd/,59dae38c6c613b02b25f13dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfjm7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nfjm7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nfjm7,NA

This notion has been largely forgotten by modern policies that regulate creativity and speech. As hard as it may be to believe, the most valuable components of our immortal culture were created under a fully open regime with regard to access to pre-existing expressions and reuse. From the Platonic mimesis to Shakespeare’s “borrowed feathers,” the largest part of our culture has been produced under a paradigm in which imitation—even plagiarism—and social authorship formed constitutive elements of the creative moment. Pre-modern creativity spread from a continuous line of re-use and juxtaposition of pre-existing expressive content, transitioning from orality to textuality and then melding the two traditions. The cumulative and collaborative character of the oral formulaic tradition dominated the development of epic literature. The literary pillars of Western culture, the Iliad and the Odyssey, were fully forged in the furnace of that tradition. Later, under the aegis of Macrobius’ art of rewriting and the Latin principles of imitatio, medieval epics grew out of similar dynamics of sharing and recombination of formulas and traditional patterns. Continuations, free re-use, and the re-modeling of iconic figures and characters, such as King Arthur and Roland, made chansons de geste and romance literature powerful vehicles in propelling cross-country circulation of culture.

The parallelism between past and present highlights the incapacity of the present copyright system to recreate the cumulative and collaborative creative process that proved so fruitful in the past. In particular, the constant development and recursive use of iconic characters, which served as an engine for creativity in epic literature, is but a fading memory. This is because our policies for creativity are engineered in a fashion that stymies the re-use of information and knowledge, rather than facilitating it. Under the current regime, intellectual works are supposedly created as perfect, self-sustaining artifacts from the moment of their creation. Any modifications, derivations, and cumulative additions must secure preventive approval and must be paid off, as if they were nuisances to society.

Rereading the history of aesthetics is particularly inspiring at the dawn of the networked age. The dynamics of sharing of pre-modern creativity parallel the features of digital networked creativity. As in the oral-formulaic tradition, digital creativity reconnects its exponential generative capacity to the ubiquity of participatory contributions. Additionally, the formula—the single unit to be used and reused, worked and re-worked—is the building block of the remix culture as well as the oral formulaic tradition. Today, in an era of networked mass collaboration, ubiquitous online fan communities, user-based creativity, digital memes, and remix culture, the enclosure of knowledge brought about by an ever-expanding copyright paradigm is felt with renewed intensity. Therefore, I suggest that the communal, cumulative, social and collaborative nature of creativity and authorship should be rediscovered and should drive our policies. In order to plead my case, I have asked for the support of the most unexpected witnesses.",TRUE,FALSE,copyright|creativity|digitization|greek law|history|internet|remix|roman law,2018-07-02T11:14:58.770621,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-08T22:45:50.543764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c49|Law|Legal History|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c58|Law|Law and Philosophy|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/citation/,ue74n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wvz4s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/relationships/node/,wvz4s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59daa990b83f6902b48f007b/,59daa990b83f6902b48f007b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ue74n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ue74n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ue74n,NA

For millennia, the production of creative artifacts has lain at the intersection between gift and market economy. From the time of Pindar and Simonides—and until the Romanticism will commence a process leading to the complete commodification of creative artifacts—market exchange models run parallel to gift exchange. From Roman amicitia to the medieval and Renaissance belief that scientia donum dei est, unde vendi non potest, creativity has been repeatedly construed as a gift. Again, at the time of the British and French “battle of the booksellers,” the rhetoric of the gift still resounded powerfully from the nebula of the past to shape the constitutional moment of copyright law. The return of gift exchange models has a credible source in the history of creativity.

Today, after a long unchallenged dominance of the market, gift economy is regaining momentum in the digital society. The anthropological and sociological studies of gift exchange, such as Marcel Mauss’s The Gift, served to explain the phenomenon of open source software and hacker communities. Later, communities of social trust—such as Wikipedia, YouTube, and fan-fiction communities—spread virally online through gift exchange models. In peer and user-generated production, community recognition supersedes economic incentives. User-based creativity thrives on the idea of “playful enjoyment,” rather than economic incentives.

Anthropologists placed societies on an economic evolutionary scale from gift to commodity exchange; in a continuum from the clan to capitalist system of organization. I suggest that this continuum should now extend to the “crowd society,” which features new modes of social interaction in digital online communities. The networked, open, and mass-collaborative character of the crowd society enhances the proliferativeness of the gift exchange model that lies in what anthropologists and social scientists described as a debt-economy.

The exploration of the creative mechanics of online communities put under scrutiny the validity of utilitarian theories of copyright and traditional market economy models. From Émile Durkheim and Mauss to Alain Caillé, anti-utilitarian thought designed a new political economy that defines humans as a “cooperative species,” rather than Homo economicus. In this context, I look into commons theory, through the lens of Elinor Ostrom’s work, and its application to modern commons-based peer production with special emphasis on Yochai Benkler and Jerome Reichman’s work. 

In conclusion, I evoke Jean Baudrillard’s essential question: “Will we return, one day, beyond the market economy, to prodigality?” I consider whether the digital revolution that promoted the emergence of the networked information economy is that “revolution of the social organization and of social relations” that might bring about, according to Jean Baudrillard, “real affluence” through a return to “collective prodigality,” rather than our “productivistic societies, which [...] are dominated by scarcity, by the obsession with scarcity characteristic of the market economy.” I argue that a possibility for the reinstatement of Baudrillard’s “collective prodigality” might have materialized in the “crowd society” thanks to technological advancement and the emergence of a consumer gift system or “user patronage,” promoting an unrestrained, diffused, and networked discourse between creators and the public through digital crowd-funding.",TRUE,FALSE,Baudrillard|copyright|creativity|economics|gift economy|internet,2018-07-02T11:14:58.636524,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-08T22:34:07.429252,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4f|Law|Law and Economics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c58|Law|Law and Philosophy|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/citation/,qj3uh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rhnxy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/relationships/node/,rhnxy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59daa72c9ad5a102b49b7b32/,59daa72c9ad5a102b49b7b32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qj3uh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qj3uh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qj3uh,NA

Originally, intermediary liability exemptions were introduced to promote an emerging Internet market. Do safe harbours for online intermediaries still serve innovation? Should they be limited or expanded? These critical questions—often tainted by protectionist concerns—define the present intermediary liability conundrum. Apparently, safe harbours still hold, although secondary liability is on the rise. As part of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Commission would like to introduce sectorial legislation that would de facto erode liability exemptions for online intermediaries, especially platforms. Under the assumption of closing a “value gap” between rightholders and online platforms allegedly exploiting protected content, the proposal would implement filtering obligations for intermediaries and introduce neighbouring rights for online uses of press publications. Meanwhile, an upcoming revision of the Audio-visual Media Services Directive would ask platforms to put in place measures to protect minors from harmful content and to protect everyone from incitement to hatred. Finally, the EU Digital Single Market Strategy has endorsed voluntary measures as a privileged tool to curb illicit and infringing activities online. This paper would like to contextualize the recent EU reform proposal within a broader move towards turning online intermediaries into Internet police. This narrative builds exclusively upon governmental or content industry assumptions, rather than empirical evidence. Also, the intermediary liability discourse is shifting towards an intermediary responsibility discourse. Apparently, the European Commission aligns its strategy for online platforms to a globalized, ongoing move towards privatization of enforcement online through algorithmic tools. This process might be pushing an amorphous notion of responsibility that incentivizes intermediaries’ self-intervention to police allegedly infringing activities in the Internet.",TRUE,FALSE,copyright|EU|European law|internet|platform|platforms|reform|technology,2018-07-02T11:14:58.416009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-08T22:23:30.898153,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7b|Law|Common Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/citation/,w7fxv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3f4zc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/relationships/node/,3f4zc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59daa3fa594d9002c5991bc5/,59daa3fa594d9002c5991bc5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7fxv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w7fxv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w7fxv,NA

Despite the strong effects of quotas, less attention has been paid to the factors that prompt countries to adopt electoral quotas across developing countries. This article employs event history modeling to analyze quota adoption in 134 developing countries from 1987 to 2012, focusing on quota type, transnational activism, and norm cascades. The article asks the following questions: (1) How might quota adoption differ according to quota type—nonparty versus party quotas?

Employing discourse analysis of 607 New York Times articles from 1969 to 2014, this paper demonstrates that radicalization discourses are not new, but are the result of complex socio-linguistic and historical developments that cannot be reduced to dominant contemporary understandings of the concept or to singular events or crises. The news articles were then compared to 850 government documents, speeches, and official communications. The analysis of the data indicates that media conceptualizations of radicalization, which once denoted political and economic differences, have now shifted to overwhelmingly focus on Islam. As such, radicalization discourse now evokes the construct radicalization as symbolic marker of conflict between the West and the East. I also advanced the established notion that news media employ strategic discursive strategies that contribute to conceptual distinctions that are used to construct Muslims as an ‘alien other’ to the West.",TRUE,FALSE,Islam|Muslim|News|Othering|radicalization|Terrorism,2018-07-02T11:14:57.992892,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-08T13:27:58.548727,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/citation/,xd3g9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zaeh2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/relationships/node/,zaeh2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59da269eb83f6902b18e7c6e/,59da269eb83f6902b18e7c6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd3g9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xd3g9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xd3g9,NA

It brings structure to a curriculum by specifying the desired knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) that the curriculum will provide, together with performance levels that characterize the learner, on each KSA, as the individual moves through stages of development. This tool unites a developmental implementation of Bloom’s taxonomy with curriculum objectives, to move learners along the articulated path from novice towards independence and expertise with built-in features of psychometric assessment validity. This tool promotes development in the target KSAs as well as assessment that demonstrates this development, and encourages reflection and self-monitoring by learners and instructors throughout individual courses and the entire curriculum. A Mastery Rubric represents flexible, criterion-referenced, definitions of “success” for both individuals and the program itself, promoting alignment between the intended and the actual curricula, and fosters the generation of actionable evidence for learners, instructors, and institutions.

In this study, we explore the impact of three categories of potential determinants of attitudes towards NPOs: Political cleavages (the cultural integration vs. demarcation cleavage and the economic integration vs. demarcation cleavage); religiosity and spirituality; and values (the survival vs. self-expression value dimension). Based on a representative survey in Switzerland, we estimate the impact of those factors for five different attitudinal dimensions and six different NPO types. The Bayesian model estimates show that all three categories of determinants have small to moderate impact. The effects of religiosity, spirituality, the self-expression value dimension, and of economic integration are generally positive. The effects of the survival value dimension and of cultural demarcation are generally negative, with the exception of the NPO type of professional associations.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|cleavage|nonprofit|nonprofit-organizations|npo|religiosity|spirituality|third sector|values,2018-07-02T11:14:53.986117,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-05T20:41:08.811533,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/citation/,qgrvu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xq3zf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/relationships/node/,xq3zf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59d6984e594d9002b2c998fa/,59d6984e594d9002b2c998fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgrvu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgrvu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgrvu,https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci7010002
