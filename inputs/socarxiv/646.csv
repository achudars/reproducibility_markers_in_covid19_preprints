Using interview, ethnographic, and archival data on visual artists, the author considers diverse accounts of the value of artistic practice and develops a model of social processes of disagreement about valuation in working life, processes of individual and collective revaluation of objects and practices about which there exists significant social agreement regarding value. The process consists of three stages: as traditional practices undergo an occupational turn, tensions between old and new orders of worth come to be expressed in conflicts over valuation; diverse accounts of value proliferate; and finally, some accounts – those that draw on contemporary visions of traditional practice – achieve widespread resonance and become widely shared meanings.",TRUE,FALSE,economic sociology|occupations|orders of worth|preprint|professionalization|socarxiv|sociological theory|valuation|visual artists|working paper,2018-07-02T10:49:13.525595,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-02T17:14:01.513000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/citation/,hbwxh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yznra/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/relationships/node/,yznra,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e12e4a594d9001fa92ce25/,58e12e4a594d9001fa92ce25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbwxh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hbwxh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hbwxh,NA

In this comment, I identify two methodological issues in McClintock’s (2014) article on beauty exchange. First, McClintock’s difference models, which find no evidence of exchange, are poor measures of exchange that fail to account for important confounders and rely upon an overly narrow conceptualization of exchange. Second, McClintock codes her log-linear models to find a difference in the effect of men and women’s beauty in exchange rather than the total effect of women’s beauty, which is both statistically significant and substantively large.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|gender|marriage|model interpretation|status exchange,2018-07-02T10:46:26.407838,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-31T19:49:36.981000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,Aaron Gullickson,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/citation/,5ydxd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rcaxh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/relationships/node/,rcaxh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58deb1e6594d9001f49754a0/,58deb1e6594d9001f49754a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ydxd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ydxd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ydxd,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122417724001

Using a large, diverse sample of U.S. resident adults, we ask under which conditions do people reveal their political preferences versus keeping them close to the vest. We find Americans are more likely to share their opinions with friends and family rather than co-workers and they are more likely to share their opinions on more salient topics. More importantly, they withhold their political attitudes specifically from those with whom they disagree in an attempt to avoid conflict. This produces the experience of highly homogeneous social contexts, in which only liberal or conservative views are voiced, while dissent remains silent, and oftentimes goes unacknowledged. This experience is not the result of homogeneous social contexts but the appearance of them.

Maximus labels the latter as participated beings (ὄντα μεθεκτά) and the former as participating beings (ὄντα μετέχοντα), with God transcending both as their cause. The structure of God-as-cause, participated beings, and participating beings matches Proclus’ three-fold structure of participation with the ontological cate- gories of unparticipated, participated, and participating. While Maximus borrows the basic language and structure from Proclus, he makes certain minor but significant differences, particularly in how the participated beings both relate to their source in God and in their status of existence. This article thus sets out to analyze 1.48–50 in the general context of the Centuries of Theology, considering how Maximus conceives of the ontological distinctions between God and God’s works. A comparison with Proclus’ understanding of participation follows, particularly from Proclus’ Elements of Theology, Prop. 23, which succinctly states the three-term distinction of participation. The resulting comparison shows that Proclus’ framework of participation is flattened for Maximus, where the participated works represent multiple properties distinct in kind from the unparticipated, while God fits analogously in the status of the unparticipated. The underlying ontology supports Maximus’ implicit denial that such participated entities represent distinct divinities, as they do for Proclus, while Maximus’ assertion of God’s transcendence is still secured with the ontological distinction between the participated works and their unparticipated cause.

We first describe the technique in detail and show how it can be implemented by individual researchers on an experiment by experiment basis. We then use a simulation to explore its success in identifying true parameter values compared to current statistical norms (ANOVAs and GLMMs). We find that posterior passing allows the true effect in the population to be found with greater accuracy and consistency than the other analysis types considered. Furthermore, posterior passing performs almost identically to a data analysis in which all data from all simulated studies are combined and analysed as one dataset. On this basis, we suggest that posterior passing is a viable means of implementing cumulative science. Furthermore, because it prevents the accumulation of large bodies of conflicting literature, it alleviates the need for traditional meta-analyses. Instead, posterior passing cumulatively and collaboratively provides clarity in real time as each new study is produced and is thus a strong candidate for a new, cumulative approach to scientific analyses and publishing.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian statistics|metascience|psychological methods|replication crisis|stereotype threat,2018-07-02T10:46:27.290813,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-29T12:44:44.205000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Experimental Analysis of Behavior|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/citation/,67jh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jrjd2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/relationships/node/,jrjd2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58dba79e9ad5a101fadc412a/,58dba79e9ad5a101fadc412a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67jh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/67jh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/67jh7,NA

This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other’s work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproduciblity, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|open science|reproducibility,2018-07-02T10:51:49.530738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-29T05:55:27.731000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/citation/,q4v73,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/76uv9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/relationships/node/,76uv9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58db4b58594d9001fb87d7e9/,58db4b58594d9001fb87d7e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4v73/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q4v73/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q4v73,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-015-9272-9
