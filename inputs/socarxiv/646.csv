psychological and academic impacts on students. However, the traditional view of
procrastination as a unidimensional construct is insufficient in two regards. First, the construct
needs to be viewed more broadly as time-related academic behavior, encompassing both
procrastination and timely engagement. Secondly, the underlying motivation of these behaviors
needs to be considered. Therefore, we developed and validated a 2×2 model of time-related
academic behavior. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis supported a four-factor
structure, and correlation with a unidimensional measure of procrastination also supported this
model. Furthermore, the 2×2 model demonstrated significantly better fit to the data than
potentially competing models. Structural equation modeling with achievement goals revealed
that the 2×2 model unveiled relationships previously obscured in the traditional model, including
that procrastination appeared to be used as a performance-enhancing strategy, while timely
engagement was used to enhance mastery. The theoretical and practical implications of these
new relationships are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.461721,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T17:56:18.192042,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Learning and Individual Differences,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/citation/,6yrdx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3fnqe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/relationships/node/,3fnqe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26ce0d86b219000f8ae967/,5a26ce0d86b219000f8ae967,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6yrdx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6yrdx/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2013.02.007,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6yrdx

However, until recently, poverty analysis in Korea has been mostly based on income. This study examines the multidimensional living conditions of the poor and its causes in Korea by testing the association between the material hardship and asset and income poverty. Material hardship is a direct poverty measure to identify the poor as those whose actual consumption fails to meet the basic needs. The main purpose of this study is to contribute to our understanding of the living conditions of the poor and the causes of material hardship including food, housing, utilities, and health hardship. Using the binary logistic regression analysis, this study found that households who were poor only in assets (and not income) were more likely than households who were income poor but not asset poor to experience all types of material hardship except for food. This finding suggests that the asset poor are more vulnerable to material hardship than is estimated by the income poverty measure. We describe how future research needs to expand hardship measures to encompass various living conditions in relation to the current Korean social context.
