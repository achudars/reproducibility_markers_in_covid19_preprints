This study set out to test the extent to which established models of life-course health development are able to explain the reciprocal relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive functioning from childhood through young adulthood. To do this, we used data from a nationally representative sample followed prospectively from adolescence through young adulthood that included information on SES and cognitive functioning at multiple points across the early life course. Additionally, this study aimed to expand these models by directly testing the role of occupational mental and social stimulation in influencing young-adulthood cognitive functioning. We did this by using linked occupational data that specifically measured job-task mental and social stimulation.

This is consistent with the fact that modeling forecasts of a sharp uptick of deaths across the United States -- as many (also largely rural) states began reopening around early May of 2020 -- turned out to be considerably overdrawn. A key implication of the experience from the six non-lockdown U.S. states, as well as from countries like Sweden, is not that Covid-19 mortality deaths in those places have been lower, but rather that if outcomes have not generally been worse than elsewhere this suggests that similar results may be achieved at substantially lesser economic, societal, and quality-of-life cost.

In less than half a year, COVID-19 swept the world, seriously threatening the safety of all mankind. At the beginning, the epidemic was most serious in China.  Under the strong command of the highest level of the Chinese government, the whole Chinese people United as one, and achieved initial results in the struggle against covid-19 with scientific prevention and control. Summarizing China's experience and lessons in combating the epidemic is undoubtedly very beneficial to the people of the world in jointly combating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. The most important experience is: strong organizational leadership, enhanced cooperation with the WHO, the establishment of a national anti-epidemic headquarters, responsible for the command and control of human, financial and material resources throughout the country, and local officials at all levels in the front line of the epidemic. Heart to heart with the people, breathe together and share a common destiny. Prevention is the first, prevention and treatment are combined. The treatment emphasizes the combination of Chinese and Western medicine. The “Four Anti and Two Balances” advocated by Academician Li Lanjuan’s team, and the “Three Drugs and Three Formulas” recommended by Chinese medicine experts of the National and Health Commission, played a key role in improving the success rate of treatment. Establish fever clinics and establish square cabin hospital to eliminate infections in hospitals, emphasizing the protection of medical staff and avoiding cross-infection. Control the source of infection, try to achieve ""four early"", early detection, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment. ""Four concentration"", focus on patients, experts, resources and treatment. Take all measures to cut off the spread. Take all measures to protect susceptible people.

Our survey took place in 2016/17, administered online in a joint project with samples of Greek and Hungarian internet users. Respondents’ three choices out of sixteen adjectives for six national/ethnic objects (Americans, Greeks, Hungarians, Russians, Arabs, and Germans) provided the basic data for mapping national stereotypes and their configurations. The analyses build on the conceptual separation of ingroup and outgroup foci, the distinction of the stereotypes alongside the dimensions of warmth and competence, and the differentiation of cognitive–instrumental, expressive–self-presentational and ruling–symbolic skills/knowledge styles. The visual patterns outlined by Ucinet/Netdraw two-mode analyses manifest varieties of semantic networks under various sociocultural settings and historical-political backgrounds.

It has created an unanticipated global public health crisis. The virus is spreading rapidly in India which poses serious threat to 135 crore population. Population density poses some unforeseen challenges to control the COVID-19 contagion. In times of crisis, data is crucial to understand the spatial relationship between density and the infection. The article study the district wise transmissions of the novel coronavirus in five south Indian states until 6th June 2020 and its relationship with the respective population density. The five states are purposefully selected for better healthcare infrastructure vis-à-vis other states in India. We observed that corona virus spread depends on the spatial distribution of population density in three states especially in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana.

Quantum information is defined as the generalization of the concept of information as to the choice among infinite sets of alternatives. Relevantly, the axiom of choice is necessary in general. The unit of quantum information, a qubit is interpreted as a relevant elementary choice among an infinite set of alternatives generalizing that of a bit. The invariance to the axiom of choice shared by quantum mechanics is introduced: It constitutes quantum information as the relation of any state unorderable in principle (e.g. any coherent quantum state before measurement) and the same state already well-ordered (e.g. the well-ordered statistical ensemble of the measurement of the quantum system at issue). This allows of equating the classical and quantum time correspondingly as the well-ordering of any physical quantity or quantities and their coherent superposition. That equating is interpretable as the isomorphism of Minkowski space and Hilbert space. Quantum information is the structure interpretable in both ways and thus underlying their unification. Its deformation is representable correspondingly as gravitation in the deformed pseudo-Riemannian space of general relativity and the entanglement of two or more quantum systems. The Standard model studies a single quantum system and thus privileges a single reference frame turning out to be inertial for the generalized symmetry U(1)XSU(2)XSU(3) “gauging” the Standard model. As the Standard model refers to a single quantum system, it is necessarily linear and thus the corresponding privileged reference frame is necessary inertial. The Higgs mechanism U(1) → U(1)XSU(2) confirmed enough already experimentally describes exactly the choice of the initial position of a privileged reference frame as the corresponding breaking of the symmetry. The Standard model defines ‘mass at rest’ linearly and absolutely, but general relativity non-linearly and relatively. The “Big Bang” hypothesis is additional interpreting that position as that of the “Big Bang”. It serves also in order to reconcile the linear Standard model in the singularity of the “Big Bang” with the observed nonlinearity of the further expansion of the universe described very well by general relativity.

axiomatically represented by its “arrow” as a well-ordering. Time can found choice and thus
information in turn. Quantum information and its units, the quantum bits, can be interpreted as
their generalization as to infinity and underlying the physical world as well as the
ultimate substance of the world both subjective and objective. Thus a pathway of
interpretation between the totality via time, order, choice, and information to the substance of
the world is constructed. The article is based only on the well-known facts and definitions and
is with no premises in this sense. Nevertheless it is naturally situated among works and ideas
of Husserl and Heidegger, linked to the foundation of mathematics by the axiom of choice, to
the philosophy of quantum mechanics and information.",TRUE,FALSE,choice|order|quantum information|time|totality|well-ordering,2020-06-03T16:31:24.277523,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-03T16:31:03.142524,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/citation/,cqan5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed73beee5cad0006729d7e7/,5ed73beee5cad0006729d7e7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqan5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cqan5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cqan5

But, I would differ on a point that in a digitally divided country like India such impulses may escalate the divide further. The regular discussions on the materiality of smartphone possession as the new mantra to bridge the digital divide in India failed to take note of its spatial and infrastructural dimensions in times of crisis. The letter views spatial distance from the core urban areas as the factor that determines the mobile network availability. In times of pandemic when the services are officially declared as deploring the divide gets intensified for students. Firstly, the failed attempts of a student to join online classes deprive her/his of parity vis-à-vis students having relatively better access to the internet.

User-generated content by non-professionals, or netizens, has shed light on issues they deem important by capturing and sharing footage appealing to their inner digital network and mainstream media. However, the influence that digital testimonials exerts on activism and indexing has been restricted to those possessing some media training. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a framework to guide vulnerable people experiencing harsh conditions to leverage the power of social media. The expectation is that such a guideline would help the most vulnerable draw the attention of other members of the community, authorities and mainstream media to the conditions they are in. The proposal of this framework is based on the theory of mediatized conflict and analysis of the hashtag #FallecidosCovid19Ec on Twitter. This hashtag helped organize scattered experiences, raise media attention and pressure officials to respond to urgent demands.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Ecuador|indexing|mediatized conflict|social media|user-generated content|video activism|vulnerability,2020-06-03T16:32:40.737271,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-03T16:32:18.560256,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/citation/,gefhv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed6d99c237cd3005654ae92/,5ed6d99c237cd3005654ae92,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gefhv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gefhv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gefhv
