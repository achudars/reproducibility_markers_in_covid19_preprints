Early child development predicts a range of later outcomes including educational achievement, employment, involvement in crime, health, and social care need. Inequalities in early childhood also cause inequalities in health later on in life. Because of this, early childhood is an important time for intervention. School readiness in England is used to refer to an assessment of a child's cognitive, emotional, and physical development, and is a major focus of effort for local and national policymakers. However, evidence on what factors affect school readiness is needed to guide policymakers at local and national levels. 
Methods
I analysed a panel data set of 150 English upper tier local authorities from 2012 to 2016, for a total of 750 local-authority years. I used fixed effects poisson regression models to test for associations between local trends in school readiness performance and sure start spending, non-sure start children’s services spending, and child poverty rates.
Results
After adjustment for local trends in child poverty and spending on other children’s services, local trends in Sure Start spending were positively associated with school readiness, both among all children and among children eligible for free school meals (an indicator of poverty). All effects were small, with a 10% change in per-child Sure Start spending associated with a less than 0.2% change in school readiness performance.
Conclusion
Despite limitations associated with the ecological nature of this study, it provides evidence that Sure Start spending may improve school readiness. This complements wider evidence on the health benefits of Sure Start, suggesting that this programme had benefits across a range of outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-02-04T19:09:23.147061,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-04T19:09:12.951008,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/citation/,rbcz5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e396badfa39b701e11dbc59/,5e396badfa39b701e11dbc59,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbcz5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rbcz5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rbcz5

Changing disparities of household non-employment in Europe during the Great Recession,"This comparative study analyses the impact of the Great Recession on household non-employment across Europe since 2008. We use the EU-SILC (2007 to 2014) for a shift-share analysis that de-composes annual variations in household non-employment in 30 European countries. Investigating whether job-loss is absorbed or accumulated by households, we break down non-employment vari-ations to changes in individual non-employment, household compositions, and polarization. We find that jobless households increased since 2008, especially in crisis countries. There is no evi-dence for widespread absorption of individual non-employment in families or multi-person house-holds. Instead, household dynamics and unequal distribution of non-employment leads to further risk accumulation within households during the crisis. Paradoxically, this pattern occurs in those crisis countries known for their traditional household structures and less accommodating welfare systems which have relied thus far on families to absorb employment risks.

The EU's policy and regulatory framework for bioeconomy and biofuels is seen as a multi-layered and complex issue. Policies around biofuels have developed recently in the EU.  Renewable Energy Directive II established a binding target for the use of renewable energy across the European Union by 2030 to be 32% of the total energy production. Finland is a country where the utilization of forest biomass has traditions ranging back centuries and continues in the present day with bioenergy holding a central role in the Finnish energy matrix. Our case study is focused on examining the public perceptions of biofuels in Finland and is linked to the discussion about climate change, global warming, and sustainable development. 
 
We used a stakeholder approach and mapped key stakeholders in the biofuel sector in Finland from six stakeholder categories: corporations, governmental actors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), municipalities, universities, and the media. We selected 59 online publications for our analysis from a time period between 2010-2019. Frame analysis was conducted using three pairs of polarised frames: environmental positive and negative, economic positive and negative, and technological positive and negative. 
 
The results show that for the most part the framing of biofuel discussion in Finland is positive and emphasizes the environmentally and economically positive aspects. The negative aspects that came to front are especially in the notions of economic costs and in arguments for environmental calculations. The EU legislation itself is seen as a background to all this discussion and is itself not scrutinized extensively by the various stakeholders.",TRUE,FALSE,biofuels|European union|frames|public perceptions|public policy,2020-02-04T19:05:22.171786,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-04T19:04:58.656387,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/citation/,5u6yp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jmd5e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/relationships/node/,jmd5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e392d84fa39b701bf1dba90/,5e392d84fa39b701bf1dba90,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5u6yp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5u6yp

However, while finding and keeping a job are considered one of the key challenges inmates face as they move back into society, there is limited research on the dynamics and trajectories of post-prison employment. Little is also know about whether work characteristics and its relation to crime affect employment trajectories following release. Using data from the study ``Reintegration, desistance and recidivism among female inmates in Chile'' (RDFC), our paper describes trajectories of employment among a cohort of 225 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile and followed during the first year after release. We use sequence analysis to explore monthly patterns of employment considering different types of work (i.e., self-employed / employed, legitimate / under-the-table). To better account for the complex relationship between work and crime, we include offending as another type of income-generating activity. Finally, we use cluster analysis and regression models to explore which individual characteristics are associated with employment and offending trajectories.

While a supportive and potentially rewarding role, informal care can become a time and emotionally demanding activity, which may hinder older adults’ quality of life. In a context of rising demand for informal carers, we investigated how caregiving states and transitions are linked to overall levels and changes in quality of life, and how the relationship varies according to care intensity and burden. We used fixed effects and change analyses to examine six-wave panel data (2008–2018) from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH, n=5076; ages 50–74).

Caregiving was related with lower levels of quality of life in a graded manner, with those providing more weekly hours and reporting greater burden experiencing larger declines. Two-year transitions corresponding to starting, ceasing and continuing care provision were associated with lower levels of quality of life, compared to continuously not caregiving. Starting and ceasing caregiving were associated with negative and positive changes in quality of life score, respectively, suggesting that cessation of care leads to improvements despite persistent lower overall levels of quality of life.

We investigate a link between these by asking whether religion buffers against the negative effect of unemployment on happiness. Although theorized or implicitly assumed in many studies, empirical demonstrations of a causal, moderating effect of religion have been infrequent and often not strong methodologically. We conduct individual-level fixed effects models to test for the buffering effect in the U.S. context using recent panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (GSS). Religious service attendance, belief in life after death, and trying to carry one’s religious beliefs over into other dealings in life all substantially buffered the effect of unemployment on happiness. Praying daily, believing God exists, identifying as a religious person, and having a religious affiliation did not. We discuss these results in the context of prior work and existing theory. To further support a causal interpretation of these findings, we also conduct a secondary analysis showing that unemployment does not appear to increase or decrease religiousness. This paper makes an important sociological contribution to the growing field of happiness research and to our understanding of how religion matters to people during hard times.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects|general social survey|happiness|moderation|religion|religious buffering|unemployment,2020-02-01T22:39:44.393727,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T22:39:14.508778,NA,NA,available,NA,https://gss.norc.org,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/citation/,pabx2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5ky49/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/relationships/node/,5ky49,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e35c1e357427b009c0c414d/,5e35c1e357427b009c0c414d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pabx2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pabx2/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaa018,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pabx2

This paper uses a Roman road built along a ridge in Cumbria, England as a case study. The ‘High Street’ Roman road provides a suitable case study as its route along the ridge is dictated by the topography. By comparing the computed Least Cost Path results when including and not including traversal across slope as a cost component, this research has found that the inclusion results in Least Cost Paths that more accurately model the known route of the Roman road along the ridge. The Least Cost Path model when not including traversal across slope resulted in 84.8% of the Least Cost Path being within 600m of the known route, compared to 100% when including traversal across slope. Due to the application of anisotropic cost functions, this research also identified that both Least Cost Path models predicted the route from the south towards the north frontiers more accurately, suggesting the Roman road was built with this direction of movement in mind.",TRUE,FALSE,GIS|least cost path|roads|Roman|spatial analysis|spatial statistics,2020-02-01T23:23:28.586869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T23:23:08.301981,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/citation/,q5yad,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e356a04fa39b700711e427a/,5e356a04fa39b700711e427a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q5yad/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q5yad

Consecration and Dispositif in Transnational Academic Fields,"Rankings have grown in importance in the last decades. This is particularly evident in, but not limited to, academia. In this paper, we propose a power analytical take on academic rankings as a transnational(izing) phenomenon. In doing so, we make two contributions. First, we develop a conceptual definition of rankings as consecratory institutions. After providing an overview of the most prominent types of rankings in the academic field and discussing the different forms they can take, we suggest that rankings operate through subjectivation, zero-sum comparisons, quantification, publication and generating a doxical belief. Second, we propose that rankings fulfill a strategic double function. As a particularly momentous consecratory institution, rankings propel power shifts in the academic field and beyond by preferring (and being pushed by) specific academic milieus, types of agents, paradigms, and strategies. As a dispositif, rankings operate at the intersection of different fields, open academic fields up for a lay audience and advance processes of transnationalization by facilitating new modes of governance for hubs of state institutions, private corporations, media corporations, and data providers. Concluding, we argue that the consecration and dispositif functions rely on some basic principles of the practical functioning of rankings.",TRUE,FALSE,Academia|Consecration|Dispositif|Field theory|Rankings|Transnationalization,2020-02-01T23:22:07.443881,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T23:21:42.164543,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/citation/,qjkmb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e353e24fa39b7007d1e0931/,5e353e24fa39b7007d1e0931,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qjkmb/,https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429274947,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qjkmb
