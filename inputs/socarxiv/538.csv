Despite these ambiguities, most would agree that Big Data and the methods for analyzing it represent a remarkable potential for advancing social science knowledge. In my Presidential address to the Southern Demographic Association, I argue that demographers have long collected and analyzed Big Data in a small way, by parsing out the points of information that we can manipulate with familiar models and restricting analyses to what typical computing systems can handle or restricted-access data disseminators will allow. In order to better interrogate the data we already have, we need to change the culture of demography to treat demographic microdata as Big.

I recommend that data collection efforts distribute an open-source set of tools for working with a particular data set that I call data-specific functions.  The goal of these functions is to codify best practices for working with the data in a set of functions for commonly used statistical software.

Using data from the content analysis of nearly 200 staging documents, as well as from interviews and observations with home stagers, I describe the strategic cultural and material work performed by home stagers as they attempt to construct the optimal purchasing experience for potential buyers. Specifically, I examine how home stagers convey a home’s livability to buyers by using material objects to influence their senses, imaginations and processes of evaluation. In so doing, I reveal a previously overlooked process that shapes the most consequential consumption decision most people will ever make (Koklic and Vida 2009), and describe how this process may act as a mechanism of exclusion.

At the same time, it remains unknown how varying sources affect the reconstruction of individual life courses and families in databases. In this paper, we conduct individual-level comparisons of family and life course reconstructions of 495 individuals simultaneously present in two well-known Dutch datasets: LINKS-Zeeland and the HSN. The first dataset is based on a province’s full population vital event registration data; the other is based on a national sample of birth certificates, after which individuals were followed in population registers. We compare indicators of fertility, marriage, mortality, and measurements of occupational status of individuals found in both databases and conclude that reconstructions in both the HSN and LINKS reflect each other well.

To date, limited research has explored intersectionality as a mobilization tool for social movements.  This paper expands recent work on how intersectional motivations influence the constituencies at protest events by comparing across some of the largest events that have taken place in Washington, DC since the Resistance began. We explore patterns of motivations of participants in marches over the first year of the Trump Presidency.  Our analyses demonstrate how individuals’ motivations to participate represented an intersectional set of issues and how patterns of issues emerge.  However, when we look across the marches, we find that the patterns are not durable, indicating the limitations of interpretations of the Resistance as a unified intersectional movement.",TRUE,FALSE,activism|intersectionality|motivations|protest|social movements|the Resistance,2018-07-02T11:45:26.665547,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-23T01:12:45.627017,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Dana R.

The relative education hypothesis posits that when college degrees are rare, individuals with more education have less competition to enter highly skilled occupations. When college degrees are more common, there may not be enough highly skilled jobs to go around; some college-educated workers lose out to others and are pushed into less skilled jobs. Using new measurements of occupation-level verbal, quantitative, analytic skills, this study tests the changing effect of education on skill utilization across 70 years of birth cohorts from 1971-2010, net of all other age, period, and cohort trends. Higher education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and college-educated workers are at greater risk for underemployment in less cognitively demanding occupations.

This represents an opportunity to examine the relationship between long-term population changes and shoreline change. Based on detailed land change data for the period 1932–2010 and a small area population estimation technique for the period 1940–2010, we examine intra-parish population changes in relation to shoreline changes for the one million plus residents living in the ten coastal parishes of Louisiana. We find that since 1940, only two of the ten coastal parishes exhibited landward population movement, which we define as movement perpendicular to the shoreline, exceeding 1 km. Three parishes exhibited seaward population movement in excess of 1 km. Overall, we find very little net intra-parish landward population movement for the region. Our findings suggest that coastal Louisiana’s historical population has not moved in concert with observed shoreline encroachment. We also find a potential tipping point related to population migration when a neighborhood loses at least 50% of its land area. Our findings suggest that this lack of landward population movement could be attributable to either localized adaptation strategies or migrations to other landward areas.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|coastal populations|Hurricane Katrina|louisiana|migration|sea level rise,2018-07-02T11:45:24.838900,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-22T01:43:59.190071,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/citation/,n7pt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6bz9p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/relationships/node/,6bz9p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab2f679a9e3c8000d724cc1/,5ab2f679a9e3c8000d724cc1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n7pt5/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11111-019-00315-8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n7pt5

M.C. Villeval (2014) summarized the main message as follows, in News and Views of the Nature issue where the Cohn study was published: the “experiment shows that although bank employees behave honestly on average, their dishonesty increases when they make decisions after having been primed to think about their professional identity.” Cohn et al. thus provide evidence that “the incentives and the business culture developed in the financial sector may undermine the honesty norms of ordinary employees.” This study may have important consequences for policy, since, Villeval continues, “it is crucial to ensure a business culture of honesty in this industry to restore trust in it.” Villeval also argues that “from a scientific perspective, this study […] supports the economic theory of social identity […], links this theory with the economic analysis of lying behavior [… and] shows how behavioural economists can contribute to a broader reflection in science about how people manage their 'multiple selves' ”. Here I show that the use of flawed statistics methods, yet employed routinely in so-called “evidence-based” science, led the authors to distort the “evidence”. I am also using this data-set as an interesting example to explore how we can use modeling and simulations to provide a fair account of the information and uncertainty conveyed by the data, based on Confidence Intervals. I provide the R-code. Based on this paper, I question the contribution of behavioral economics to the understanding of human behavior and conclude with considerations on honesty and science.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:45:23.977688,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-22T01:41:52.538056,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/citation/,nt6xk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/865md/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/relationships/node/,865md,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab28a00ea370000108cd443/,5ab28a00ea370000108cd443,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt6xk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nt6xk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nt6xk

This paper examines the reporting of voluntary accounting ratio by Malaysian companies in corporate annual reports. Drawing on agency and signaling theories, this paper explores whether associations exist between company performance and voluntary disclosure of accounting ratios. In particular, associations are tested between the extent of ratio disclosure and company performance (namely profitability, liquidity, leverage, and company efficiency), size and industry. Six hypotheses are tested using data collected from 2003 annual reports of 100 Malaysian listed companies. This paper provides evidence that the extent of voluntary ratio disclosure is low; and size, industry as well as liquidity significantly influence the reporting of ratios in corporate annual reports. The implications of these findings are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,Accounting information|Accounting ratios|Annual reports|Disclosure|Financial reporting,2018-07-02T11:45:23.936405,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-22T01:40:05.059409,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/citation/,rms3v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dw45r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/relationships/node/,dw45r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab27f49ea370000138cd236/,5ab27f49ea370000138cd236,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rms3v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rms3v/,https://doi.org/10.1108/19852510880000632,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rms3v
