In this study, we explore which factors affect geographic clustering of longevity and indicate whether survival advantages occur early in life, later in life, or over the entire lifespan. 150 years of mortality data are used to reconstruct the lifespans of the 1812-1862 Zeeland cohort, resulting in a sample of 176,577 individuals from 101 municipalities. We found evidence of longevity clustering for women. Geographic patterns in longevity were similar for men, but not statistically significant. For both sexes, the environment affects individuals over the entire life course and not in early or later life only. Clustering of longevity was associated with agricultural practices, demographic pressure, and poverty, whereas the religious denomination or population density of a municipality had no effect on individual chances to become long-lived. Our findings underline the importance of the living environment for individual chances to become long-lived.

This shows how one of the biggest educational challenges for K – 12 STEM education is that few general guidelines or models exist for teachers to follow regarding how to teach using STEM integration approaches in their classroom. This also goes to show how the most common conception of STEM education might be the notion of integration – meaning that STEM is the purposeful integrations of the various disciplines as used in solving real – word problems. Despite the benefits of integrated curricula seem clear, there are barriers that must be negotiated when teachers choose to implement integrated STEM curricula. Therefore, the focus of this literature review will also be on quantitative studies that provide information on teachers continuously using a traditional instruction contradicting the definition of integrated STEM education. To implement effective integrated STEM education, attention has been paid to teachers' using constructivist teaching strategies to implement integrated STEM education that can help students gain interest in STEM subjects.",TRUE,FALSE,STEM,2019-04-29T03:18:48.631407,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-29T03:18:30.787361,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7b|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Secondary Education and Teaching|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7f|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Higher Education and Teaching,Jessica Patel,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/citation/,4bhrx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc6653600a81000175b1a05/,5cc6653600a81000175b1a05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bhrx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4bhrx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4bhrx,NA

These frameworks are based preferentially on conceptual approaches, which leads to biases when applied in practice. Here, we present a study with an alternate focus: the skills proposed in the frameworks are connected with user behavior and heuristics are employed to group these skills. The objectives of the study were to: (1) achieve a greater coherence between the skills incorporated in these frameworks and user behavior, and (2) identify and reliably organize the clusters of skills that form frameworks. The study consisted of collecting data from a group of students about their practices within the skills of the Mozilla Web Literacy Map. The data was then grouped via factor analysis. The results were then contrasted with the initial organization of the Mozilla framework. The gap between the theoretical definition of a skill and individual behaviors was found to be more pronounced in the case of those skills whose definitions included a wider range of concepts and practices.

The implementation of inquiry-based science instruction in school curricula requires not only a shift in teachers’ theoretical perspectives on science and science education, but also a change in school policy. Studies examining the impact of teachers’ theoretical lenses on their teaching practices reveal that teachers who recognize the interplay of science education and society, and the idea that students build knowledge based on preexisting knowledge over time, will be more likely to see the importance of, and attempt to implement, inquiry-based instruction in their classrooms. Additionally, an analysis of policy documents reveals that: organizational change is difficult especially because those creating and implementing the policy do not fully understand or even realize the impact on teachers and students.

It was found that the co-authorship network is geographically diverse and influenced by Brazil and Mexico, yet disconnected from the majority of LATAM countries. Research output and impact are increasing but still far from global dynamics and not yet permeated by the open access agenda. Finally, the most consolidated research topics associated with DT are “Industry 4.0”, “smart manufacturing” and the “Internet of Things”.",TRUE,FALSE,Bibliometrics|Digital Transformation|Latin America,2019-04-26T15:14:24.776404,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-26T15:12:19.068739,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ce9|Arts and Humanities|Latin American Languages and Societies|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Julián David Cortés-Sánchez|Management School|Universidad del Rosario,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/citation/,65vjq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ce3rx/,ce3rx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc31dbb1906ec001705900f/,5cc31dbb1906ec001705900f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/65vjq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/65vjq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/65vjq,NA

Debt patterns, by contrast, have remained relatively unexplored. Using 2001-2013 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), we show that after peaking in 2007, debt levels for most debt types had returned to pre-financial crisis levels for blacks and whites by 2013. The primary exception to this is education debt, on which this paper focuses. We show that educational debt has increased substantially for blacks relative to whites in the past decade. We also show that this increase in debt is not attributable to differences in educational attainment across racial groups. These trends, we argue, reflect a process of predatory inclusion, where lenders and financial actors offer needed services to black households, but on exploitative terms that limit or eliminate their long-term benefits.  Predatory inclusion, we propose, is one of the mechanisms behind the persistence of racial inequality in contemporary markets.",TRUE,FALSE,household debt|predatory inclusion|race|racial wealth|student debt,2019-04-26T14:11:48.831815,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-26T14:09:45.722631,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,SAGE Publications,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/citation/,5mfne,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc30ca9e68786001813d66a/,5cc30ca9e68786001813d66a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mfne/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5mfne/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5mfne,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496516686620
