Archaeologists across South America have pointed to patterns of regional abandonment during the Middle Holocene (8200 to 4200 cal BP) as evidence of sensitivity to shifts in hydroclimate over this period. We develop a unified approach to investigate demography and climate in South America and aim to clarify the extent to which evidence of local anthropic responses can be generalised to large-scale trends. We achieve this by integrating archaeological radiocarbon data and palaeoclimatic time series to show that population decline occurred coeval with the transition to the initial mid-Holocene across South America. Through the analysis of radiocarbon dates with Monte Carlo methods, we find multiple, sustained phases of downturn associated to periods of high climatic variability. A likely driver of the duration and severity of demographic turnover is the frequency of exceptional climatic events, rather than the absolute magnitude of change. Unpredictable levels of tropical precipitation had sustained negative impacts on pre-Columbian populations lasting until at least 6000 cal BP, after which recovery is evident. Our results support the inference that a demographic regime shift in the second half of the Middle Holocene were coeval with cultural practices surrounding Neotropical plant management and early cultivation, possibly acting as buffers when the wild resource base was in flux.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Climate change|Demography|Domestication|Holocene|Palaeoecology|Radiocarbon|Simulation|South America,2018-11-09T15:16:21.602744,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-09T15:15:32.321350,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/citation/,7zw6x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v2c93/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/relationships/node/,v2c93,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be56e589738410018225f82/,5be56e589738410018225f82,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7zw6x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7zw6x/,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43086-w,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7zw6x

Based on 18 months of field observations, the paper narrates the presence or absence of formal documentation and informal rules across three categories (price, care, and transportation) at its case study site of the goat market in Bolgatanga, Ghana. It finds that there is an almost complete lack of standard documentation seen in the everyday life of developed countries.

Attempts to substantiate this assumption offer sparse confirmatory evidence. Therefore, this research brings the most data and comprehensive measurement models thus far to investigate a single underlying attitude. The data from 1986-2017 in 43 countries suggests a latent ideal role attitude; however, measurement varies somewhat by historical institutions and levels of development across societies. At first the data seem to fail metric invariance tests as a first step in establishing the latent attitude.

This paper ventured on the analysis of the prevalence and perceived consequences of early marriage on school enrollment completion and academic performance of female students in senior secondary schools in the North-East Geo-political zone, Nigeria. The objective of the study is to determine the major effects of early marriage on female youth educational development. Ex-post facto design was used for the study. Three hundred and fifty four (354) females’ students for 2015/2016 session constituted sample respondents for the study. They responded to prevalence and perceived consequences of early marriage questionnaire (PCEMQ) while the sample of female student senior secondary school certificate (SSCE) qualifying examination results for the 2015/2016 session was used for the analysis of student academic achievement in English, Mathematics and Biology. The data were analyzed with the statistical package for social science (SPSS) using t-test of inferential statistics i-e. T-test of dependent and independent sample to determine the significance different between the variables on enrolment, completion and academic performance. The major finding revealed that, there was significant different in enrolment completion and academic performance of early marriage students and those married at a later age. It was further recommended that, there is need for a reform in laws discouraging early/force marriage in the country. Also guidance and counselling should be introduced in all schools, and parents should delay marriage of their daughters until at a later age.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-11-10T13:29:01.372427,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-10T13:28:45.206266,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/citation/,5rqy7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ma4ch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/relationships/node/,ma4ch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be453110fa9f50019b5f6dd/,5be453110fa9f50019b5f6dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rqy7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5rqy7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5rqy7

Today goats are mainly kept for surplus purposes, while sheep and yak are kept for subsistence purposes. The implementation of the new economic reform policy in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) by the end of the Cultural Revolution brought the nomads in TAR closer to a market economy, and the Aru nomads are now dependent on a production that both can create a surplus to provide them with a cash income and a production that can provide them with subsistence goods. This change has resulted in a change of herd and sex composition in the nomads’ herds, of importance being a larger number of goats, and a larger number of male animals. The increasing importance of cashmere wool can be viewed as giving the Aru nomads new opportunities instead of decreasing their choices. However, this change in economic patterns can have long-term negative consequences for the pastoral system, where an increase in goat numbers might exacerbate rangeland degradation and a decrease in number of female animals in herds might have consequences for the growth potential of the herds. Consequently, herds with large proportions of adult male animals will be more affected by climatic perturbations, and the recuperation potential for herds will be decreased.",TRUE,FALSE,cashmere wool|Chang Tang (Tib.: byang thang)|China|goats|nomadic pastoralism|overgrazing|production|risk,2018-11-08T17:26:44.976608,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-08T17:25:49.940436,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,Marius Warg Næss,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/citation/,mb7v5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fnhm9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/relationships/node/,fnhm9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be41ea60fa9f5001ab442d3/,5be41ea60fa9f5001ab442d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mb7v5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mb7v5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mb7v5
