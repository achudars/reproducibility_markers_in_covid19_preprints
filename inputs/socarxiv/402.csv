As agriculture is one of the major consumers of freshwater, more yield or output using same or less amount of water has become the global interest. Therefore water productivity (WP) is also considered as an indicator of agricultural productivity. Several research works have been conducted on WP values of different yields, tools and technologies to improve WP. Most of the studies on water productivity considered the crop productivity using limited water resource and searched for better technologies for improving crop water productivity. Researchers also concentrated on improving irrigation efficiency or water use efficiency at field level for irrigation through water management and for yielding more crops. But there is a research gap in assessing values of water productivity in aquatic ecosystems especially floodplain areas. A floodplain area remains dry and flooded in two different seasons. Thus, a combined valuation of aquatic resources and rice production in two different seasons are very important to measure the efficient usages of the lands. So, this study deals with how to measure annual aggregate water productivity for dry season and flood season in a floodplain beel area.",TRUE,FALSE,Floodplain; Beel; Water Productivity; Fish-Rice Culture,2019-02-28T19:27:09.383549,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T18:56:37.587468,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/citation/,q3ayc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3su2k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/relationships/node/,3su2k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c776db382a3950017d59b4f/,5c776db382a3950017d59b4f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q3ayc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q3ayc

This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in Malaysia. The data were collected based on opinions of the ten factors of value creation practices by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Further, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach’s alpha test, the validity of the data was tested by checking the normality test through skewness and kurtosis, and the consistency of the data was tested using factor analysis. On an average, 80.6% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of value creation. Overall, the federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on certain elements of value creation than the state owned GLCs. Among the elements of value creation, the state owned GLCs emphasize the most on quality development and brand value creation, where the federal owned GLCs emphasized the most on reputation. The GLCs engaged in service sector emphasized the most on brand value and the GLCs engaged in manufacturing sector emphasized the most on customer satisfaction and quality development.

Modern economics operates basically through two major modes of entrepreneurships: the market/private sector economics relying on commercial entrepreneurships (self-interest- centric) and the state/public sector economics relying on state entrepreneurships (public-wellbeing-centric). However, both have, individually and jointly, failed to ensure economics‟ fundamental goal of wellbeing for human societies. In response, a community wellbeing-centric social enterprise economics (third sector), which features cooperatives and not-for-profit social enterprises in the name of foundations, trusts/awqāf, social businesses, and similar undertakings, has emerged as a make-up strategy to meet the minimum unmet requirements for social wellbeing. However, there is a strongly felt belief that this community wellbeing-centric social enterprise economics needs to be broadened and mainstreamed in order to include entirely charitable institutions, predominantly not-for-profit operations, and predominantly for-profit businesses but blended with provision of social welfare programs like corporate social responsibility, etc., for its emancipation as a major economic system to be able to play a leading role for ensuring desirable economic growth and development. Islamic entrepreneurship, which is basically a community-centric mode of business initiative, is closely related to social entrepreneurship. It is an antidote to the problem of intolerable economic and social dualism and a natural strategy against all forms of capitalist exploitation to control world resources, like, in the past, through European colonialism, and now, through American-led state terrorism. It is the natural guard against economic inequity, wealth concentration, and social divides. Based on its potential and using examples from Bangladesh and Malaysia, we argue that the Islamic style social entrepreneurship, which is operationally a profession for a mission, is intellectually and operationally superior and more efficient for effectively widening and mainstreaming community-centric social enterprise economics to ensure development with equity and social justice. The paper aims to put forward social enterprise economics (third sector) for dialogue and research in the context of effective functioning of modern economies ensuring community wellbeing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-28T18:54:09.344734,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T18:53:27.134645,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/citation/,r286g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/unj8f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/relationships/node/,unj8f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c77654462c82a0019ddefce/,5c77654462c82a0019ddefce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r286g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r286g

However, the conventional system of socioeconomic role assessment cannot evaluate the performance of Islamic microcredit in terms of achieving the objectives of Shariah for the Islamic microcredit model. Therefore, this study examines the role of Islamic microcredit based on the achievement of Maqasid Al-Shariah. It uses primary data that were collected through a questionnaire survey distributed among 393 microcredit borrowers from Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM). The survey was conducted from July 2013 to December 2013 in the State of Sabah and in Peninsular Malaysia.

This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey among the head of department of 109 departments and agencies under 24 federal ministries including the Prime Minister Department in Malaysia. The data were collected based on the opinion about ten factors of internal control practices in the department or agency by using seven-point Likert scale. The data are analysed under descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Further, the reliability of the data is tested by using Cronbach alpha test, and the validity of data is tested by checking the normality of data through Shapiro Wilk test and graphically. Overall, 86.2% of the respondents mentioned that they practice internal control system in their department. However, the priority of these ten factors of internal control differs among the services schemes. Overall the internal control system of the financial schemes group is strong, but their emphasis on the documentation is at the average level only. However, the internal control in the engineering, information system, education and medical &amp; health schemes are below the overall average internal control score. The public sector in Malaysia needs to focuses more on internal control and its proper assessment system to become a reliable and efficient sector.",TRUE,FALSE,Internal Control System; Public Sector; Factor Analysis; Malaysia,2019-02-28T18:52:01.692448,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T18:51:15.191364,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/citation/,y4zfa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gw456/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/relationships/node/,gw456,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c775de182a3950018ce93d8/,5c775de182a3950018ce93d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zfa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4zfa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4zfa
