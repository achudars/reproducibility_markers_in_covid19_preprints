Nevertheless, how to shift population behaviour patterns in this way remains one of the greatest uncertainties for research and policy. Evidence about behaviour change interventions that are easier to evaluate tends to overshadow that for population- and system-wide approaches that generate and sustain healthier behaviours. Population health interventions are often implemented as natural experiments, which makes their evaluation more complex and unpredictable than a typical randomised controlled trial (RCT). We discuss the growing importance of evaluating natural experiments, and their distinctive contribution to the evidence for public health policy. We contrast the established evidence-based practice pathway, in which RCTs generate ‘definitive’ evidence for particular interventions, with a practice-based evidence pathway in which evaluation can help adjust the compass bearing of existing policy. We propose that intervention studies should focus on reducing critical uncertainties, that non-randomised study designs should be embraced rather than tolerated, and that a more nuanced approach to appraising the utility of diverse types of evidence is required. The complex evidence needed to guide public health action is not necessarily the same as that which is needed to provide an unbiased effect size estimate. The practice-based evidence pathway is neither inferior, nor merely the best available when all else fails. It is often the only way to generate meaningful evidence to address critical questions about investing in population health interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,Evaluation; natural experimental studies; non-randomised studies; practice-based evidence; public health policy,2019-08-15T15:08:43.445231,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-15T15:07:55.756771,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/citation/,s36km,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d553dfbb7169700191121d3/,5d553dfbb7169700191121d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s36km/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s36km/,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2019-213085,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s36km

Although this macro-level trend is well-established in research literature, less is known about subnational patterns of income inequality in the U.S., particularly as they vary between and within rural and urban localities. Using Census and ACS data, this study produces Gini estimates of within-county income inequality and examines these trends across a six-strata urban-rural typology from 1970 to 2016. This study finds the following. Income inequality has remained consistently higher in nonmetropolitan counties than metropolitan counties throughout the study period. However, levels of inequality have converged by 2016, a convergence that has been driven by increases in metropolitan counties. There are notable exceptions to the secular trend of increasing inequality. The central Plains region has experienced decreasing levels of inequality, and inequality in large, peripheral metropolitan counties lags noticeably behind other types of counties. Almost all low-inequality counties in 1970 have shifted to moderate- or high-inequality, such that almost no one lives in low-inequality places by 2016. This increase in exposure to inequality has been particularly dramatic among residents of large, central metropolitan counties. As the only county-level analysis to track income inequality across the rural-urban continuum from 1970 to 2016, this study lays the foundation for more sophisticated analyses that explain spatial variation in income inequality and that account for the demographic and economic diversity of the rural and urban United States.",TRUE,FALSE,income inequality|rural demography|rural-urban continuum|spatial inequality|United States,2019-08-14T19:42:25.646836,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14T19:42:06.953409,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Brian C.

To address this issue, a plethora of demand reduction efforts have been carried out. These necessitate consumer research which provides crucial knowledge for designing and evaluating targeted interventions. We implemented a rigorous consumer survey on saiga (Saiga tatarica) horn use in Singapore, where usage is legal and widely sold. Saiga are Critically Endangered antelopes from Central Asia with horns (often marketed as ling yang) used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Few past studies have assessed saiga horn consumers. This work is the most extensive consumer research to date specifically characterising saiga horn consumers and usage. We conducted 2294 in-person surveys on saiga horn use with Chinese Singaporeans, employing neutral questioning approaches. We found 19% of individuals reported saiga horn as a product they choose most often for themselves and/or others when treating fever and/or heatiness (a TCM state of illness), indicating a minimum estimate of high-frequency usage, not including possible low-frequency users. Overall saiga users were most characterised as middle-aged Buddhists and Taoists. However, saiga users were found in a range of demographic groups. Women preferred saiga shavings (the more traditional form), while men preferred saiga cooling water (the more modern form). About 53% of individuals who used saiga horn themselves also bought it for someone else. Buyers for others were most likely to be female middle-aged Buddhists or Taoists. Key motivating reasons for usage were “it works” and “someone recommended it to me.” The top two reported recommenders were family and TCM shopkeepers. Saiga users were more likely than non-saiga users to perceive saiga as a common species in the wild. This research holds significance for interventions targeting saiga horn consumption within Singapore and throughout Asia, by identifying potential target audiences, product types, non-desirable alternatives, and motivations for use.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-14T18:55:31.744183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14T18:55:00.733199,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/citation/,t4dp7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bk879/,bk879,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d54374e278c07001aad7f00/,5d54374e278c07001aad7f00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t4dp7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t4dp7

The social uprising resulted in the ousting of the Governor of Puerto Rico (Dr. Ricardo Rosselló, Ricky), the resignation of the majority of his staff something unprecedented in the history of Puerto Rico; this period has been called El Verano del 19 (Summer of 19). Social media played a crucial role in both the organization and dissemination of the protests, marches, and other activities that occurred within this period. Puerto Ricans in the island and around the world engaged in this social movement through the digital revolution mainly under the hashtag #RickyRenuncia (Ricky Resign), with a small counter movement under the hashtag #RickySeQueda (Ricky will stay). The purpose of this study is to illustrate the magnitude and grass roots nature of the political movement’s social media presence, as well as their characteristics of the population of both movements and their structures. We found that #RickyRenuncia was used approximately one million times in the period of analysis while #RickySeQueda barely reached 6,000 tweets. Particularly, the pervasiveness of cliques in the #RickySeQueda show concentrations of authority dedicated to its propagation, whilst the #RickyRenuncia propagation was much more distributed and decentralized with little to no interaction between significant nodes of authority. Noteworthy was the role of the Puerto Rican diaspora in the United States of America and around the world, contributing close to 40% of all geo-located tweets. Finally, we found that the Twitter followers of the former governor had indicators of being composed of two distinct populations: 1) those active in social media and 2) those who follow the account but who are not active participants of the social network. We discuss the implications of these findings on the interpretation of emergence, structure and dissemination of social activism and countermovement to these activities in the context of Puerto Rico.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital Activism|Network Analysis|Puerto Rico|#RickyRenuncia|#RickySeQueda|Social media|Verano del 19,2019-08-13T20:24:45.240840,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-13T20:24:32.323807,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/citation/,wdk9u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5304a0c3f52f0019ff2337/,5d5304a0c3f52f0019ff2337,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wdk9u/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wdk9u

Contributing to scholarship on the attitudinal consequences of mobilization, we examine how protest shaped popular perceptions of democracy during the post-Mubarak transition in Egypt. We do this by matching Wave II of the Arab Barometer survey with geo-referenced protest events reported in Arabic-language newspapers. Our results show that Egyptians came to hold less favourable attitudes to democracy following sustained protest in their district. We find that this relationship was especially pronounced in areas where protestors launched longer-lasting, static street protests that targeted public space. Qualitative case details illustrate how such tactics could disrupt everyday life and impact livelihoods. These findings highlight one way in which popular support for democracy can be eroded during a transition.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-14T13:45:02.809370,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14T13:44:53.335450,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Neil Ketchley and Thoraya El-Rayyes,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/citation/,9rjfv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d52a451e7391a001816f38d/,5d52a451e7391a001816f38d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9rjfv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9rjfv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9rjfv

Contemporary American Ukrainian writers have made attempts to introduce their hybrid experience and include it into American culture. One of them is Alexander J. Motyl, whose novel Fall River (2014) is analyzed as an example of border writing. The novel is based on the author’s narrative memory, rooted in his mother’s stories about Ukraine and their family members’ crossings of borders in the interwar period and belonging to two cultures, Ukrainian and American, that shaped their identities.
