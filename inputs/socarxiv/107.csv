Throughout this work, it was sought to answer the question whether the religious belief of Iraqis is reflected in online chats Iraqi by involving situation-bound rituals in their CMC and the functions these expressions fulfil in this communication. Although computer-mediated communication lacks nonverbal behaviour and prosodic features support the speakers’ polite intention, many researchers assert that there are many resources whereby individuals can resort to in demonstrating their solidarity. The Methods is based on examining synchronic messages exchanged on WhatsApp and Viber in four groups with the participation of 99 participants in total whose age ranged from 15 to 70 years old, with different educational qualifications and religious orientations. Social distance between the participants varied from intimate to neutral, and large. Likewise, social rank ranged from equal footing to low-high relationships and high-low relationships. The setting involved different occasions such as congratulations, greetings, farewell, thanking, offering condolences as well as receiving bad news. The findings of this research have shown that Iraqi Arabic speakers incline to enhance the politeness of their message by involving religious vocabularies that take mostly the form of supplication. Besides, the religious lexicon stands as a form of etiquette that promotes the speakers’ and the addressee’s faces. FIt is hoped that this work would lead to further studies related to religious expressions across computer mediated communication.p",TRUE,FALSE,computer-mediated communication (Iraq)|politeness|pragmatics|religion|situation bound utterances|speech acts,2021-01-14T04:42:06.820880,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:36:09.328915,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/citation/,vgma3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffbc75ba0109050089940c/,5fffbc75ba0109050089940c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgma3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vgma3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vgma3

This case study was conducted at Majmaah University, Saudi Arabia, to explore the significance of educational exam standardization and its impact on the process of implementation, leading to a balanced and equitable assessment of English language skills. During the study, 250 final English skill exam questions of two semesters were analyzed. A mixed-method approach using a questionnaire and Focused Group Discussion was adopted to collect relevant data. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS 16, and the qualitative data was processed by thematic analysis. The quantitative data results showed that questions were balanced, valid, and reliable in language skill exam papers designed for undergraduate English students. The qualitative data revealed four major themes – standardization of questions, the efficacy of Bloom’s taxonomy, assessment/evaluation, and alignment of the question with learning outcomes. These emerging themes highlighted the effectivness of standardizing exam papers, identified problems, and suggested ways of improvement. The study indicates that exams must be scrutinized for the sake of standardization in terms of maximum course coverage; the variety in the question item; clear, concise, and precise instructions; validity and reliability of exam papers; and the alignment of questions with the course and program learning outcomes to ensure the implementation of the revised Bloom’s taxonomy.

Education is the only industry that is completely transferred to online mode in most countries around the world. Online learning was the best solution for continuing education during the pandemic, especially in tertiary education. This study aims to determine the challenges and obstacles confronted by English language learners (EFL) in Science and Arts College, Alula, Taibah University, Saudi Arabia, during switching to online learning in the second semester of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The contribution of this study is to evaluate the learners’ new experiences in online education and to assess the feasibility of the virtual methods of learning. This is achieved by analyzing 184 learners’ responses to the survey-based questionnaire. A descriptive statistical method was used to test the validation of the study. It is found that the main problems that influence and impact online EFL learning during COVID-19 are related to technical, academic, and communication challenges.

The rationale for conducting this study is to   provide students with useful learning tools that may improve their idiomatic knowledge and also help them to practice English idioms anytime and anywhere outside the classroom. It also aimed to help teachers to streamline EFL instruction, making it more efficient, effective, and user-friendly. As such, the main research questions are what is the effect of WhatsApp-based learning activities on developing university female EFL students? and what are Saudi female EFL students’ perceptions on learning idioms using WhatsApp?. To answer these questions, 70 EFL female students in the Department of English Language and literature at Imam Mohammad ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) involved in the study. They were assigned into two groups; experimental group, who was taught English idioms via WhatsApp-based learning activities, and control group, who was taught English idioms conventionally in classroom. Two instruments were used to collect the data; a pre-post idioms achievement test and a post-study questionnaire.

It analyses the leading factors that affect language maintenance and language shift: a particular focus is given to identifying the various domains in which language maintenance is facilitated; the attitudes held by the Keralite parents and their children towards their first language (L1), the initiatives taken by parents, religious and cultural organizations; and the role of educational institutions in promoting language maintenance. Data for this study have been gathered from semi-structured interviews and participant observation of Keralites who have lived in Oman for more than ten years.  Analysis of the data indicates that while parents value their mother tongue as their first language and take various measures to maintain it, second-generation children are not keenly attached to L1. Instead, their first language oracy is strikingly marked with code-switching and code shifting, and their writing skills in L1 are diminishing. Refuting the previous findings, the present study reveals that language shift is a temporary phenomenon, and it does not take place at the cost of L1. On the contrary, various factors contribute to the maintenance of their heritage language. Also, the migrant Keralites, as a result of their living abroad, acquire two or three more new languages:  English, Hindi, and Arabic depending on their study and work domains, thereby making them a multilingual society. Language shift can gradually result in linguicide, which can have various effects such as alienation from and the loss of culture and cultural values.

The authors present their experience of undertaking a three-month online course “Constructive Classroom Conversations: Mastering Language for College and Career Readiness,” hosted by Stanford University, and discuss the benefits of applying this tool at universities. The study describes the basic mechanisms of the Conversation Analysis Tool aimed at developing specific communication skills in students of English for Speakers of Other Languages. The central research question is whether this method is as feasible for teaching literature as it is for language classrooms. The authors demonstrate their takeaways from applying this technique in teaching world literature, namely, analyzing literary dialogues in different classroom activities. The research findings indicate that the Conversation Analysis Tool is an efficient method for the formative assessment of senior students in the world literature classroom. This technique helps students reveal the pragmatic features of fiction dialogues, the writer’s narrative intentions, and the reader’s expected reception. The suggested method also demonstrates students’ progress in the studied topics and identifies possible gaps in mastering the educational content.

A phrase or a sentence is not a random collection of words. In the absence of grammar, words hang together without any real meaning. Thus, grammar plays an essential role in language teaching. With adequate grammar explanations in meaningful contexts and practice, some serious errors in learners' language can be avoided. This study aimed at examining the relationship between teachers’ perceptions of grammar teaching and their actual practices in a Saudi EFL context. Questionnaires and classroom observation checklists were used to gather information about teachers' perceptions of grammar teaching and to compare that with their practices. The paper sought to find answers to these questions: 1) What are teachers’ perceptions of grammar teaching? 2) Do teachers’ perceptions of grammar correlate with their actual teaching in EFL classes? 3) What are teachers’ perceptions of problems, if any, hindering their practice of grammar teaching? The sample consisted of 23 teachers who completed a questionnaire discussing their perceptions of grammar teaching and practice. Six of these teachers were observed teaching grammar in classes. The findings revealed that there was a negative correlation between teachers' perceptions of grammar teaching and their perceptions of their grammar classes. Also, there was a negative correlation between teachers' perceptions of grammar teaching and the observed classes.

This study aims to enhance our understanding of what it is actually that Indonesian ELT practitioners are doing, understanding, and what they are trying to achieve in their classroom activities. This study investigates explanative answers to a single research question: In what ways are Indonesian ELT practitioners reflective in their classroom practice? This study conducted at secondary schools and universities uses a qualitative approach, utilizing observation, interviews, and documents as data collection methods, and content analysis as a means of data analysis. This research involved four participants selected purposively and voluntarily. Its findings, analysis, and interpretation are presented descriptively. The major finding of this study suggests that Indonesian ELT practitioners are reflective in three ways: being reflective within the process of their teaching, known as “reflection-in-action, being reflective in their post-teaching referred to as “reflection-on-action, ” and being reflective in their future improvement planning known as “reflection-for-action.” The practitioners’ reflexivity  aims to improve the quality of their teaching, which can potentially affect the quality of their students’ learning. Thus, arguably Indonesian ELT practitioners have performed the praxis in their language teaching through reflective practice.",TRUE,FALSE,English Language Teaching|Indonesia|praxis|reflective practice,2021-01-14T04:48:04.503580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:39:02.487628,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/citation/,au4ec,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffb6c2e80d370518a5a70f/,5fffb6c2e80d370518a5a70f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/au4ec/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/au4ec/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.18,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/au4ec

Understanding teachers’ beliefs and theoretical orientations about reading are more than necessary to rethink reading instruction and assessment. The present paper reviews a case study conducted at the Department of English, Tlemcen University, Algeria. The study looked at teachers’ beliefs and theoretical orientations regarding reading assessment and its effect on EFL learners’ comprehension ability. It examines the correspondence between reading teachers’ theoretical orientations and classroom reading assessment. This study included 20 teachers and 120 students. Data collection procedures included questionnaires and classroom observations. Data analysis exposed the congruence between teachers’ beliefs about reading and classroom reading assessment. Moreover, standardized classroom reading assessment negatively impacted learners’ comprehension ability and reading motivation. The discussions underscored the importance of alternative reading assessment methods such as portfolios, which represent genuine and effective language learning strategies according to modern research.",TRUE,FALSE,alternative assessment|evaluative practices|reading assessment|reading models|teachers’ beliefs|Tlemcen University,2021-01-14T04:49:03.796144,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:40:29.703398,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/citation/,y8s4h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffb55ce80d370517a5882d/,5fffb55ce80d370517a5882d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8s4h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y8s4h/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y8s4h

In the current study, the cognitive linguistic theory of domains by Langacker (1987) is adopted to provide new horizons in learning vocabulary and qualify Iraqi students with a deep knowledge analysis of the meanings of lexical concepts. This paper aims to test the validity of expanding the English language vocabulary for second language learners from Iraq through domains theory. It also attempts to find how the domains theory supports L2 learners in identifying meanings related to lexical concepts. Accordingly, an experimental study is conducted on fifty-eight university students of the second year level from the University of Baghdad, Iraq. The pre and post-tests are analyzed by using the Editor for the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results show the following: First, a progression of more than (0.05≤) is discovered in terms of students' understanding of the interrelationships between lexical concepts. Second, a new vision is dealt with to connect lexical concepts with their meanings according to the focus of the speakers using Langacker's theory. Third, domains theory (profile/ base organization, active zone, and the perceptual basis for knowledge representation) has proven effective in expanding Iraqi students' treatment and perception of semantic domains of English lexical concepts precisely.",TRUE,FALSE,active zone|Cognitive semantics|domains|encyclopedic view of meaning|Iraqi Learners|knowledge representation.,2021-01-14T04:50:05.506599,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:40:47.930425,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/citation/,rq8eb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffb4b486541a052114ee6b/,5fffb4b486541a052114ee6b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rq8eb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rq8eb/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rq8eb
