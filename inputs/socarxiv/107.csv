While debates are heated about the optimal algorithm designs with respect to their effectiveness and ethics, little is known about how the algorithms are deployed, experienced, challenged, and reshaped in society. Combining in-depth interviews, media articles, and policy documents, this study examines how Health Code, the Chinese contact tracing and risk assessment algorithm, is assembled, disassembled, and reassembled in society. I argue for a conceptualization of algorithms as sociotechnical assemblages with the involvement of diverse human and non-human actors, which are constantly in action. I first explore the intensive and invisible work and infrastructures that enable Health Code to be enacted. However, these assembly attempts are consistently challenged in differing situations and destabilized Health Code from time to time. Health Code reassembles under the diverse yet unintended engagements of social actors, local networks, and power relations, which creates multiple Health Codes at different periods of time and social localities. I also examine how people game and bypass the algorithm’s surveillance as forms of everyday resistance. These findings go beyond the current technical debates and bring a more dynamic, nuanced, and realistic depicture of algorithms’ operation and power. Lastly, I explore how algorithms contribute to a new dialectical relationship between state and society, and how this relationship reshapes the mechanism of surveillance, inequality, and citizenship in this digital age.",TRUE,FALSE,Algorithms|China|Contact tracing|Covid-19|Risk assessment|Surveillance,2020-09-26T19:21:41.664164,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:21:17.014578,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0a|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0b|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies|Chinese Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/citation/,g3reu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s2zyn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/relationships/node/,s2zyn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6f6cb846080902da1b496c/,5f6f6cb846080902da1b496c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3reu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g3reu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g3reu

Estimating their effect on topic prevalence and polarization in German state legislature,"Between 2008 and 2014, German politics experienced a shake-up by AfD’s move into the state parliaments. While many studies examine the party’s success factor in elections, only a few studies study the effect of the new party on parliamentary work. This thesis tests two hypotheses in this regard: First if the AfD set its primary focus on different policy areas than the other parties in the minor appellations and second if the entrance of the AfD leads to a higher polarization in a state parliament. We use the structural topic model to obtain topics for each appellation. To measure polarization, we rely on the expression of agreement and disagreement during a speech and a text classifier’s ability to distinguish between non-AfD and AfD speeches. As headline findings, we note that the AfD emphasizes policy areas in their appellations that provide the potential for populist statements such as extremism, migration, or law &amp; order. Secondly, polarization generally increases with the party’s entrance into a state parliament, but the influence varies with the measurement chosen. More broadly, the results suggest that the STM and text classifiers’ metrics can be a reliable tool to draw inferences on significant research questions in social science.",TRUE,FALSE,germany|parliament|polarization|populism|speech|state parliaments|structural topic model|topic prevalence,2020-09-26T19:20:44.041413,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:20:32.020983,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/370V8H,no,It is briefly described in the paper itself.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/citation/,y5j2u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6f650e9e9a3d02f66e3ccb/,5f6f650e9e9a3d02f66e3ccb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y5j2u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y5j2u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y5j2u

Using a novel computational framework, where individual agents attempt to solve problems by modifying, combining and transmitting technologies in an open-ended search space, this paper re-evaluates two prominent explanations for the cultural evolution of technology: that humans are equipped with (i) social learning mechanisms for minimizing information loss during transmission, and (ii) creative mechanisms for generating novel technologies via combinatorial innovation. Here, both information loss and combinatorial innovation are introduced as parameters in the model, and then manipulated to approximate situations where technological evolution is either more cumulative or combinatorial. Compared to existing models, which tend to marginalize the role of purposeful problem-solving, this approach allows for indefinite growth in complexity while directly simulating constraints from history and computation. The findings show that minimizing information loss is only required when the dynamics are strongly cumulative and characterised by incremental innovation. Contrary to previous findings, when agents are equipped with a capacity for combinatorial innovation, low levels of information loss are neither necessary nor sufficient for populations to solve increasingly complex problems. Instead, higher levels of information loss are advantageous for unmasking the potential for combinatorial innovation. This points to a parsimonious explanation for the cultural evolution of technology without invoking separate mechanisms of stability and creativity.",TRUE,FALSE,combinatorial innovation|cultural evolution|cumulative culture|information loss|problem-solving|technological evolution,2020-09-26T19:14:01.727202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:13:36.340176,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/j-winters/cetech,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/citation/,aypnx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q8jdu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/relationships/node/,q8jdu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6ee5759e9a3d02e46e3c6e/,5f6ee5759e9a3d02e46e3c6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aypnx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aypnx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aypnx

We apply the theory to the context of equity crowdfunding oﬀerings in the U.S. While the signal from ventures’ backing by professional investors is associated with more positive outcomes of the crowdfunding campaigns, our ﬁndings show that this eﬀect is mediated by the equity stake requested by the crowdfunding platforms as compensation for their services.

The change reflects an increased use of ornaments and an uneven distribution of ornaments in a pericolonial context.

To understand how COVID-19 has influenced the practices of community-led urban agricultural spaces, we suggest future efforts take into consideration three essential areas of focus: uses of community gardening in combating food insecurity during a pandemic, changes in community garden operations as a response to crises, and community gardening's role in nurturing emotional well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-29T07:17:41.949219,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-29T07:17:27.040521,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/citation/,6587c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6e6ced68d85002a98a0c18/,5f6e6ced68d85002a98a0c18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6587c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6587c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6587c

We applied Specialized Questioning Techniques (SQT) to estimate and compare behavioral prevalence of giraffe meat consumption between direct questioning and two SQTs, Randomized Response Technique (RRT) and Unmatched Count Technique (UCT), from 2017 to 2019. Comparisons between the two samples yielded significant differences across all three methods, with confidence intervals distinctly divergent between years. The significant disparity between the two samples for all three methods suggests that there was a true reduction in giraffe meat usage from 2017 to 2019. A key change in the study area between the two time periods was the introduction of a community-based program for giraffe conservation. Primary program activities, including ecological monitoring, community outreach and education, and collaboration with wildlife security teams, align with other conservation programs that have demonstrated reduced poaching pressures. This study demonstrates an application of SQTs to detect a decline of giraffe meat consumption, providing an alternative to self-reported data for monitoring sensitive behaviors related to direct exploitation and illegal uses of wildlife.",TRUE,FALSE,consumption|giraffe|randomized response technique|unmatched count technique|wild meat,2020-09-26T19:08:52.448522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:08:27.119229,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Kirstie A.

We also assessed whether the specialised questioning technique of nominative technique could be used within qualitative data collection methods, such as semi-structured interviews. The technique theoretically ensures more accurate statements of illegal wildlife consumption behaviour, by maintaining the anonymity of an individual’s sensitive behaviour through asking about the behaviour of peers. We also directly asked about participants’ use of bear bile. Nominative technique showed that approximately 11% of the participants’ peers used bear products, with respondents’ direct admittance of using bear bile was nearly double, at 23%. Use of bear parts appears to not be sensitive in northern Laos. In addition, a strong association was found between nominative technique and direct questioning responses, which indicates that users of bear parts have social networks with higher levels of use. This lends supports to theories that use of wildlife products is directly influenced by the social group. The underreporting found through nominative technique indicates the high variability of response that can occur within small samples; however, these results show that nominative technique may be a simple, useful tool for triangulating data, assessing users’ integration into social networks of use, and assessing changes in behaviour prevalence.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-26T19:08:33.227074,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:06:11.512816,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Elizabeth O Davis|Brian Crudge|Jenny Anne Glikman,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/citation/,gvknx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6e076f460809027e1acf54/,5f6e076f460809027e1acf54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvknx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvknx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvknx
