However, due to its complexity, people’s understanding of the theory has remained superficial, giving rise to great differences in understanding. Scientists often regard the Five Elements theory as unscientific. At the same time, enthusiasts of traditional Chinese culture often overuse it and reach specious conclusions, posing a challenge to rational understanding by the public. This study proposes that in nature—a dynamic and complex system—evolution determines the existence of the law of matter, and the law of matter exists to better perform evolution. Yinyang and Wuxing are the laws of evolution. Using scientific logic, it is also shown that Wuxing is the most basic movement mode of complex dynamic systems, reflecting the basic dynamic mechanism of complex systems’ responses to environmental information. This study further proposes that ‘Metal’ is the control center of the entire system and represents the response, processing, and distribution of internal information commands. ‘Water’ represents the process of internalizing energy and the inflow of basic materials. ‘Wood’ represents the process of forming a high-level substance based on information. ‘Fire’ represents the realization of the function of advanced matter and satisfying the information needs. Finally, ‘Earth’ represents the process of returning advanced substances to basic substances and the feedback from material world to the original information. In fact, any complex phenomenon is nothing but the evolution of information in the material world, revealing the scientific nature of the Five Elements can provide new ideas for the human cognition of complex phenomena and provide a new perspective for solving complex system problems.",TRUE,FALSE,chinese philosophy|five elements|laws of evolution|wuxing,2020-06-19T19:22:03.559755,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-19T19:21:39.123801,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/citation/,dqbfk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eeb08616598280022cf0fec/,5eeb08616598280022cf0fec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqbfk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dqbfk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dqbfk,NA

making situations, especially when making judgments between economic and health
concerns. One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence
effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of
the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together.
This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In
this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. economic concerns across two
decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates
heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.’s classic
experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming
condition. Methods and Findings: Four hundred twenty participants from the UK were
recruited via a crowd-working platform. They were presented with two casualty-
minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100
lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at
the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose
between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of
program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally
attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a)
economic concerns; b) health concerns; or c) control (no priming). Results showed that
in the choice condition, unless primed for economic concerns, health concerns are
more prominent (only under economic priming was there a significant preference for
program Y, p&lt;0.001). In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of
health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all “preferred” the cheaper
option. Conclusions: These results add further support to the practical relevance of
using the proper decision-making modes in times of consequential crises where
multiple concerns, interests, and parties are involve",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-21T03:27:20.761854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-21T03:27:05.756558,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/vh2r6/?view_only=42c180392c5c4e0c959141d214d844a0,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/citation/,mrv69,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vh2r6/,vh2r6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eeb07a576ebd80022cd93ad/,5eeb07a576ebd80022cd93ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrv69/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrv69,NA

Drawing data from multiple waves of the World Values Survey (1999-2009), the final sample of this study includes 44,391 respondents nested in 43 countries. By using a multi-level modeling technique, I find that, in general, religiosity is positively associated with respondents’ environmental concerns in terms of willingness to pay for the environment, agreement with increased taxes to prevent environmental pollutions, and choosing environmental protection over economic interests. Political ideology, measured via individuals’ self-placement on a left-right continuum, does not have a meaningful relationship with environmental concern in a global setting. Nevertheless, I observe an interaction effect between religiosity and political ideology. Increased religiosity, particularly among more conservative individuals, is associated with a higher probability of environmental concern. Comparatively, religiosity virtually does not affect liberals’ concern for the natural environment. In other words, the gap between liberals and conservatives regarding the natural environment is more pronounced at lower levels of religiosity; as religiosity increases, the gap starts to narrow.

This version has not been copy-edited. 

Drawing from ethnographic research, this study examines how interactions between protesters and police unfold at Black Lives Matter demonstrations in two cities with distinct policing regimes. I argue that protesters consciously resist the terms of engagement set by police in an effort to demonstrate their opposition to police violence and racism, as well as demonstrate that communities can police themselves, while also seeking to avoid arrest or police violence. I call this protesters’ interactional resistance. This resistance is predicated on protesters pushing the boundaries of rules of engagement while using their structural knowledge of the situation and likely police responses. In contrast with prior research, a focus on interactional resistance emphasizes the actions and decisions of protesters, not just the police. It also shows how protesters manage to enact resistance even when they are trying to avoid arrest. Overall, these micro-interactions both point to and shape the structures of repression.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-17T03:47:22.030130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-17T03:47:13.177477,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/citation/,w8zn7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee985c389c97e001b1f707c/,5ee985c389c97e001b1f707c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8zn7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8zn7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8zn7,NA

However, the capacity of researchers to explain these patterns is constrained by the informal and secretive nature of much of this interaction. In this paper we develop a novel text-as-data approach which maps the informal patterns of information exchange among the stakeholders that engage with EU policymaking by detecting instances of text reuse among the comment letters submitted by these groups to the same policy proposal. We deploy this approach to analyze a novel dataset of publicly available comments to a wide a range of EU policies, and find that there are significant differences between the structure of information exchange networks and more formal lobbying coalitions in the EU, as well as between the groups that engage in these forms of coordination.",TRUE,FALSE,Coalitions|European Union|Interest Groups|Text-as-Data|Text Reuse,2020-06-17T17:31:44.408304,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-17T17:07:50.830383,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon request,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/citation/,uq698,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee923ca594133000b72e6d6/,5ee923ca594133000b72e6d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uq698/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uq698/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uq698,https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2020.1817132

Anecdotal evidence of police officers appearing equally drawn to White people in predominantly Black neighborhoods is sometimes presented to suggest that the phenomenon is race neutral. Motivated by such narratives, we examine the extent to which Black versus White racial categorization encourages police scrutiny in out-of-place and in-place contexts. Applying the veil-of-darkness and vehicle search threshold tests, we find that in-place or out-of-place, being seen as White is always an advantage in Philadelphia.",TRUE,FALSE,policing|racial profiling|segregation,2020-06-17T03:46:44.831184,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-17T03:46:24.645931,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/vehicle-pedestrian-investigations|https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html|https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5e|Law|Law and Race|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Sage Publications,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/citation/,c7eq9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee91388ae883f002b601dc0/,5ee91388ae883f002b601dc0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c7eq9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c7eq9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c7eq9,https://doi.org/10.1177/0011128720926122
