monetary compensation for disadvantaged groups. In such proceedings, aggrieved claimants are
likely to make a variety of claims about the use of money to represent their experience, ranging
from demands for increased compensation to rejections of the entire process altogether. This article
draws attention to the communicative functions of money in the reparation process. It claims that
actors may grudgingly agree to attach a monetary value to what they hold sacred, but
simultaneously strive to preserve their sense of self-worth and to elicit identification by raising
moral critiques about the use of fiscal logic. To exemplify, the article focuses on the 2005 removal
of Jewish-Israeli settlers from Israeli-occupied territories. It shows that settlers indeed demanded
to be compensated fiscally for their lost property. At the same time, it shows that they proffered
moral denunciations of the use of fiscal logic in representing their experience and offered alternate
logics of evaluation in its stead. The settlers resisted shame and devaluation through such
competing logics, demanding that the state reaffirm a positive and embracing relationship with
them despite its decision to evict them.",TRUE,FALSE,Commensuration|Cultural sociology|Jewish-Israeli Settlements|Reparations|Restorative Politics,2018-07-02T10:51:48.018199,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-20T12:23:40.747000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/citation/,pna7w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s6bhs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/relationships/node/,s6bhs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58592102b83f6901fb456894/,58592102b83f6901fb456894,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pna7w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pna7w/,https://doi.org/10.1111/soin.12028,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pna7w

To remain viable in the rapidly changing technological and social context, architecture needs to extend its engagement with research, reappraise its fundamental goals and develop creative strategies adequate to new challenges. However, utilisation of research in design disciplines is still immature and the methodologies of this utilisation remain a matter of controversy and active debate. In particular, the potential of cross-pollination between designing and research requires further clarification. This thesis addresses this need by developing a methodological approach that combines participant observation and investigative designing. Utilising these methodologies, this thesis considers several case-studies, including interactive installations and virtual environments. Engagement with case-studies through participant observation and investigative designing in this thesis motivates a discussion that reinstates place as the focus of architectural practice. Existing discourse and practice in architecture often assume retrograde, romantic, essentialist and exclusionary understandings of places, for example as singular, bounded and static. By contrast, this thesis highlights an open and flexible vision of places as performances. Considering the possible roles of architectural designing in place-making, it suggests that architects cannot produce ready places but can engender placemaking performances and influence their growth with provocative, open and collaborative creative-design strategies. Having established the case for distributed, polyphonic, campaigning creativity in place-making, this thesis considers whether design computing can support its performative needs. Commonly, researchers and practitioners in architecture express concerns that design computing can hinder human creativity. By contrast, this thesis demonstrates that design computing can support distributed creativity by staging multiplicious, open, flexible, idea- and insight-generating participatory exchanges. In the process, this thesis considers interactive cinematography and procedural designing as place-making actions. This re-conceptualization demonstrates that design computing can usefully support creative place-making and sometimes be indispensable for its success. This thesis contributes to knowing by 1) utilising and presenting an unorthodox methodological approach to architectural research; 2) presenting an approach to understanding and making of places novel to the field of architecture; and 3) re-conceptualizing innovative design-computing as an important creative resource for placemaking.",TRUE,FALSE,architecture|experience|performance|place|Preprint|socarxiv|technology,2018-07-02T10:47:33.004051,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-17T13:05:53.656000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/citation/,9evkj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7mtn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/relationships/node/,c7mtn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5855326c9ad5a1004aa2702f/,5855326c9ad5a1004aa2702f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9evkj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9evkj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9evkj

Yet, prior work has not assessed the link between the two. We hypothesize that deportations exacerbate rates of foreclosure among Latinos by removing income earners from owner-occupied households. We employ a quasi-experimental approach that leverages variation in county applications for 287(g) immigration enforcement agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and data on foreclosure filings from 2005–2012. These models uncover a substantial association of enforcement with Hispanic foreclosure rates. The association is stronger in counties with more immigrant detentions and a larger share of undocumented persons in owner-occupied homes. The results imply that local immigration enforcement plays an important role in understanding why Latinos experienced foreclosures most often. The reduced home ownership and wealth that result illustrate how legal status and deportation perpetuate the racial stratification of Latinos.",TRUE,FALSE,287(g)|Deportation|Foreclosures|Immigration|Latinos|Mixed-status Households|Race|Stratification,2018-07-02T10:51:05.719957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-13T22:47:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/citation/,jjnu6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/du6rq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/relationships/node/,du6rq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5850799d6c613b021400aaf0/,5850799d6c613b021400aaf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jjnu6/,https://doi.org/10.15195/v3.a46,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jjnu6

The Global North has tended to emphasize the common responsibilities of all nations to reduce emissions while nations of the Global South have tended to place more emphasis on the differentiated responsibilities. The Global North-South negotiating positions are derived from the inequality in: the historical and current emissions of greenhouse gasses, the emerging consequences of climate change, and the geo-political negotiating power between nation-states. However, these broad sweeping categories miss diverse goals and policy preferences among civil society actors within nations. Through in-depth, in-person interviews, this research documents the surprisingly strong presence of Global North policy preferences among the field of Kenyan environmental NGOs – a field that is significantly divided among the “climate justice” policy priorities strongly associated with nations of the Global South and “emissions reductions for all” priorities associated with nations the Global North. Qualitative data captures the rationale of KENGOs for the respective policy script preferences. Utilizing the nation-state as a unit of analysis would miss this variation among civil society actors within the Global South, variation that demonstrates the complex interaction between the diffusion of global policies and domestic social contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|climate justice|Global South|Kenya,2018-07-02T10:47:31.222070,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-13T16:42:43.308000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/citation/,8w3wf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2vvdm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/relationships/node/,2vvdm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/585023ffb83f69020ff66a71/,585023ffb83f69020ff66a71,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8w3wf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8w3wf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8w3wf
