(Nature 535, 547–550; 2016) used a cross-cultural experiment to show that an isolated South American indigenous group, the Tsimane', exhibit indifference to musical dissonance. The study acts as an important counterweight to common beliefs that musical preferences reflect universal, mathematically based harmonic relationships that are biologically determined by low-level perceptual mechanisms. While we applaud their cross-cultural approach, the limited number of populations studied (n=5) makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about causal processes. In particular, the conclusion that consonance is thus ""unlikely to reflect innate biases"" seems too strong, as innateness does not require complete universality. 

Exceptions are always found in any phenomenon as complex as human music. Indeed, our own global analysis of traditional music found dozens of aspects of music that were common cross-culturally, but none that were absolutely universal without exception (Savage et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 112, 8987-8992; 2015). We showed a consistent tendency to avoid dissonance, yet we still found many examples of sustained dissonance in Western and non-Western music (e.g., Eastern European harvest songs, Papua New Guinean lullabies).

Such trends and exceptions are not necessarily indicative of the degree of innateness of aspects of music (which, like other domains of culture, likely reflects some combination of nature and nurture). For example, humans and other animals display an innate aversion to bitter and sour foods, but these can be overridden by cultural conventions and developmental experience (Chandrashekar et al. Nature 444, 288-293; 2006). Diversity in musical perception and production could emerge in the context of weak cognitive biases or relaxation in selective pressures (such as the unusual absence of group performance among the Tsimane'). Broader cross-cultural studies of both perception and production of music and other aspects of human behavior (including cultural evolutionary and developmental frameworks) will be needed to clarify the roles of nature and nurture in shaping human diversity.",TRUE,FALSE,aesthetics|cross-cultural|ethnomusicology|music|music perception,2018-07-02T11:08:04.380428,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-23T02:12:02.986949,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d46|Arts and Humanities|Music|Ethnomusicology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/citation/,964ut,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3vwja/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/relationships/node/,3vwja,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599ce32ab83f690251663d37/,599ce32ab83f690251663d37,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/964ut/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/964ut,NA

Less understood is how and to what degree these factors, after controlling for strength and the number of people affected, vary over space and time. Here we fit models to casualty counts from all casualty-producing tornadoes during the period 1995-2016 in order to quantify the interactions between population and energy on casualty (deaths plus injuries) rates. Results show that the more populated areas of the Mid South are substantially and significantly more vulnerable to casualties than elsewhere in the country. In this region casualty rates are significantly higher on the weekend. Night and day casualty rates are similar regardless of where the tornadoes occur.

It also proved a major current influence of the old highly cited researchers, of the specialized nationwide research institutes, of the journals with high impact factors that publish papers about all the aspects of Food technology research, and of the United States specifically University of Massachusetts Amherst on Food technology research.",TRUE,FALSE,Food technology|Influential countries|Influential institutions|Influential journals|Influential papers|Influential scientists|Research Influences|Web of Science,2018-07-02T11:06:53.984957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-19T19:12:48.455832,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/citation/,x2ewu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3a87v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/relationships/node/,3a87v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59988c82594d900259520c50/,59988c82594d900259520c50,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x2ewu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x2ewu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x2ewu,NA

In this work, I will analyze the racialized subjectivity and identity (trans)formation of a diaspora of African Americans who partook in an intergenerational migration from the plantations of central Alabama to the coalfields of southeastern Kentucky in the first half of the 20th century, and then moved on to urban cities throughout the United States throughout the Civil Rights-era.  The latter generation of migrants collectively experienced major shifts in the social structures of their community of origin, such as transitioning from “colored schools” to a State mandated integrated school system, retrenchment in the labor economy of a single-industry community, and the subsequent mass out-migration from their community of origin. These jolts to the social structures of their society not only altered their horizon of opportunity, but also resulted in major dislocations in the cultural systems that informed their collective identity.  Particular to the case, I am concerned with the ways in which these cultural traumas—memories of events that collectivities believe rended the social fabric of their society—impacted the collective identity of this diaspora.  In spite of their geographic dispersion, this generation of migrants has managed to stay connected through a set of “invented traditions” that they constituted at the tail end of their out-migration.  For example, the Eastern Kentucky Social Club—an organization established by this group of migrants in 1970—has hosted a reunion in different cities across the country every year for the last forty-four years.  At its height, this event drew over 3,000 African American migrants from across the country.  The broader aim of the project is to reconstruct the rich history and culture of this special population of Black Appalachians to put forth a re-examination of W.E.B. Du Bois’ phenomenological analysis of racialized subjectivity and African American identity formation in 20th century America.

The overarching research questions that guide this study are (1) How do we explain the emergence of their post-migration diasporic identity? (2) How has their collective identity been negotiated, transformed and reinscribed through their changing, and sometimes contested, subjectivity as racialized American citizens through the continuum of the pre and post civil rights era? I will specifically focus on three events that have been the site of transformation for the individuals in my case, (1) the school desegregation process—an event that occurred almost a decade after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision in this region, (2) the mass out-migration from southeastern Kentucky—a community level event that was a precursor to the emergence of their diasporic identity, and (3) the construction of the EKAAMP archive—an event that marks the institutional transference from memory to history.  These eventful temporalities provide three categories of analysis that will allow me to make important linkages to my research questions in the context of the past, present, and future.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:06:53.273839,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-18T23:19:44.267786,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,Karida L. brown,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/citation/,6qrdp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f98sx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/relationships/node/,f98sx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59977498b83f69025064f6f1/,59977498b83f69025064f6f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qrdp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qrdp,NA

This appears in the language used in the fields, and in the sometimes implicit assumptions made in discussions of them. We give examples from articulations of the so-called Fermi Paradox, discussions of the settlement of the Solar System (in the near future) and the Galaxy (in the far future), and METI. We argue that science fiction, especially the campy variety, is a significant contributor to the ‘giggle factor’ that hinders serious discussion and funding for SETI and Solar System settlement projects. We argue that humanity's long-term future in space will be shaped by our short-term visions for who goes there and how. Because of the way they entered the fields, we recommend avoiding the term ‘colony’ and its cognates when discussing the settlement of space, as well as other terms with similar pedigrees. We offer examples of science fiction and other writing that broaden and challenge our visions of human futures in space and SETI. In an appendix, we use an analogy with the well-funded and relatively uncontroversial searches for the dark matter particle to argue that SETI's lack of funding in the national science portfolio is primarily a problem of perception, not inherent merit.
