Yet embedded in Professor Fishman's theory is a paradox that threatens to disable the putative benefits of creating around. Specifically, the conditions that are necessary for creating around are the same conditions that we would expect to lead to licensing of previously existing works, rather than to the creation of new ones.

the state power into a national crisis. Buback played a noticeable role

general and became the protagonist of the fight against terrorism. The

the US State Department from the years 1973-1976, provide a glimpse on 
what turmoil the Federal Attorney General created for the Allies and the

Copyright is not based on written claims, but because copyright links exclusive rights to technological actions such as reproduction, distribution, or transmission, the language of the copyright statute, and judicial readings of the statute, create boundaries around which potential infringers may technologically navigate. For example, the Aereo case recently decided by the Supreme Court involves technology that was explicitly designed to conform to non-infringing definitions of private transmission found in previous court decisions.
