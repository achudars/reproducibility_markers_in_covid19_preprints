This paper aims to contribute to the postcolonial discourse on island tourism by exploring Jamaica Kincaid’s A Small Place (1988) as a discursive subversion of a tourism industry centered on the exclusion of local agency and history. Framed in postcolonial theory, the study focuses on enclave tourism as an unsustainable economy based on tourist/host division. It draws on Edensor’s (2000, 2001) and Carrigan’s (2010a, 2010b) conceptualizations of enclave tourism. Kincaid’s representation of postcolonial Antigua reveals the complicity of colonial legacy with unsustainable tourism development. Sites of ruins and decline become tourist attractions and monuments to rottenness, signifying the dispossession of the local Antiguans and the erasure of their culture. The study reveals how tourist enclaves, as represented in Kincaid’s travel narrative, do not only produce a divided and contrived space but also limit the tourist experience of the real Antigua.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-12T16:25:20.817863,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:24:51.407746,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/citation/,rg8dm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5af3781e8b9c0086e8fe4b/,5f5af3781e8b9c0086e8fe4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg8dm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rg8dm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rg8dm

Over time, women could no longer stand this situation, and movements for women’s rights were set up. Political, social as well as cultural transformations in the country were accompanied by a necessarily urgent literary reaction, especially by female writers. Edna O’Brien, one of the most loved, and influential Irish women writers, published her first novel, The Country Girls (1960). She helped open discussion of the role of women and sex in Irish society and of Roman Catholicism’s persecution upon women. The present paper intends to focus on Irish women through The Country Girls.

One of the most faithful yet different of its adaptations is Bakathir's The New Shylock (1945). The present paper aims at deconstructing Shakespeare's Shylock and Bakathir's Shylock in the light of Derrida's concept ""différance"" to compare the two versions of the Jew and possibly capture the  extremes of Jewish identity through several stages of their history. The significance of comparing Bakathir's version of the Jew, which exemplifies the opposite Eastern pole, to the Shakespearean Western is supposed to portray two crucial stages in the process of Jewish identity construction. Tackling the two Shylocks from the deconstructive perspective provides a text-oriented analysis focusing primarily on the binaries and the semantic and etymological meanings of words that reflect the tell-tale moments in both texts. The study finds out that whereas Shakespeare's Shylock is defeated because of his inability to control events, Bakathir's Shylock succeeds in mastering the play of circumstances, but temporarily. His suicide, at the end, enhances possibilities to answer the main inquiry: Who is ""Shylock""? Therefore, further studies are recommended to compare and contrast Shakespeare's Shylock with the most recent adaptations, in the East or the West, using the same theoretical framework to provide an image of the Jew/ Zionist in the spatial and temporal processes of the Jewish enigmatic identity development.",TRUE,FALSE,Bakathir|Derrida|différance|Jewish identity|Shakespeare|Shylock|The Merchant of Venice|The New Shylock,2020-09-12T16:26:04.343825,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:25:47.785252,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/citation/,d87jn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5af14bb9173400af0a57f1/,5f5af14bb9173400af0a57f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d87jn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d87jn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d87jn

The study tries to answer the following question: How does Pamuk use the personal stories of his characters to chronicle the historical development of Istanbul? Two novels have been selected for the study; A Strangeness in My Mind and The Museum of Innocence.  The significance of the study lies in trying to show how these two texts, not only reveal the writer’s reflections on urban space, but also show the character’s experience in urban space and how the author uses these experiences to chronicle the history of the city.

It has been carried out during the second semester of the academic year 2019-2020 at the College of Science and Humanities, Hotat Bani Tamim, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Since the issue of classes and class struggle dominates almost all aspects of life, it is natural to consider the importance of this phenomenon in literature, especially through theories that view literature as a reflection of real life. The most suitable school of literary criticism to tackle such a subject, according to the authors, is that of Marxism. Two basic Marxist principles are at the center of the study: class conflict and the notion of base and superstructure. The novel is studied as part of the superstructure which is a reflection of the ongoing class conflict occurring at the base mainly between feudal landlords and peasants. Three main questions have been addressed: 1) Is the novel a mere perpetuation of the upper class ideology and interests? 2) Is it a subversion of that ideology? or 3) Does it signify both a perpetuation of a class-structured society while condemning the negative aspects of the dominant ideology? The study reaches the conclusion that while Fielding favors a perpetuation of the already existing social order, he, nevertheless, levels bitter criticism at various upper class beliefs and practices that hinder the advancement of poor class causes.",TRUE,FALSE,Base and superstructure|class conflict|Joseph Andrews|Marxist criticism,2020-09-12T16:29:05.173559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:28:49.539582,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/citation/,n9mau,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5aee7bb9173400af0a50dc/,5f5aee7bb9173400af0a50dc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n9mau/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n9mau/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n9mau

A lot of literature has been made on analyzing metaphors in different genres, yet how metaphorical language is employed in best-selling books gained little attention from discourse analysts, so this study comes to fill this gap in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to focus on this crucial field of written discourse and best-selling books in particular. It will investigate the linguistic techniques which are employed in a way to persuade the audience to change their behavior or ideas and adopt new ones, especially the use of metaphorical expressions and storytelling. Metaphors will be analyzed according to Lakoff &amp; Johnson’s (1980) perspective of metaphorical expressions and the ""Speech Act Theory"" proposed by Austin (1962) and Searle (1969). The paper concludes that metaphorical language is an integral part and pervasive in Byrne's writing style. She uses metaphorical expressions to deliver her message indirectly to convince the audience to adopt her ideas to call them for action.

This has a significant impact on learning foreign languages through translation, and that linguistic studies on animal’s, and birds’ words have to continue. However, the present study isn’t based on experimental laboratory research seeking to analyze their means of communication. The author tries to suggest a reading and linguistic methods that may enhance and provide guidance for the process of the interpretation of the meanings of such Verses or Ayahs. He also attempts to facilitate their understanding when translated into English/French. The study finds out that literal translation develops shortcomings in the rendering of similar Verses, into English and, or French. Another item related to the findings is that in the translations of pronouns the author, sometimes  uses parentheses to clarify the meaning. The study recommends the using of specific translation techniques and authentic Islamic books of explanations and commentary while interpreting the Qur’anic Verses.

This Foucaultian social tool attracted the use of many historically disenfranchised groups on the merits of sexuality and race. Feminists noted a gender discrepancy in pay and appearance in the hierarchy of this industry and attributed it to systemic flaws, not just with the industry but with humor’s theoretical and conceptual structures. The aim of this research work is to assess the impact of their ideological quest for a new theory of humor on the integrity of American stand-up comedy. The application of Peterson’s “Political Correctness Game” framework suggests that there are possible ulterior motives behind calls to change the foundational structure of American stand-up. The problem that this paper attempts to address is whether calls for inclusivity in the framework of intersectionality theory in humor can be characterized as a legitimate call to limit, what the feminist labeled, as acts of hubris and humiliation against victimized minorities? Or are these calls permeating into dangerous social and even legal territories, where comedians’ rhetoric is regulated and their artistic freedom is infringed upon? This paper contended that feminist calls for a new theory of humor derived from intersectionality lens would only create “echo chambers” of already like-minded individuals, rather than exerting social change through the subaltern social power that can be generated from stand-up humor.",TRUE,FALSE,feminism|humor|intersectionality|political correctness|social theory|stand-up,2020-09-12T16:28:29.444807,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:27:55.495963,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/citation/,v7dsc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5aeb482c7355008be9fd16/,5f5aeb482c7355008be9fd16,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7dsc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v7dsc/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v7dsc

Landscape is an essential factor that reveals a great deal of the culture of pre-Islamic Arabia, which is distant in place, historical framework, and literary tradition from its translators. This article examines the importance of a translator’s awareness of the communicative function of source text references to landscape to adopt appropriate translation strategies. The article presents a case study of a verse line alongside a corpus of nineteen English and French translations. The source text, the Mu‘allaqa of Imru’ al-Qays, names three mountains in Arabia, and space and distance are core themes in the verse line. Comparison is both synchronic and diachronic: at the same time that every translation is compared to the source text, it is also compared to other translations. Prose translations are also examined separately from verse translations, with cross-references in both directions. The translators who adopted source-text-oriented strategies missed communicative clues regarding the setting. However, those who endorsed target-text oriented strategies produced effective and adequate translation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-12T16:28:52.995261,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:28:18.470206,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/citation/,59hwb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5ae9301e8b9c007ee96f0b/,5f5ae9301e8b9c007ee96f0b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59hwb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/59hwb/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/59hwb

This article addresses this critical gap, focusing on Carter’s employment of birds and the greenwood in her story The Erl-King as a metaphor for gender roles and power relations. Hence, the alliance between her ecopoetics and feminist vision forms a case of “ecofeminism.” In her defense of “minor” and oppressed forms of life, Carter makes her caged birds emblems of women imprisoned by patriarchy. Their liberation by the female narrator at the end of the story is not only a sign of resistance but also an indication of the essential harmony and mutual strength of women and nature. Surprisingly though, and before this unexpected end in which the narrator strangles the Erl-King with his own hair, nature is made complicit in the oppression of women rather than simply liberating. This can be explained through Carter’s ambivalent brand of postmodern feminist poetics that rejects fixities and conventional binaries, unsettling the patriarchal myth that women are merely close to nature. Thus, Carter subverts feminist logic by exposing how women and nature are not only closely allied or opposed to patriarchy but also complicit in their own oppression. Moreover, she subverts the woman/nature dichotomy by making the Erl-King the epitome of a harmonious life in nature rather than plainly defending women as expected in feminist texts. Carter deconstructs established myths and conventional gender roles, accounting for subtle female desire in the process of articulating feminist poetics via nature.",TRUE,FALSE,caged birds|Carter|ecocriticism|feminism|imprisonment|nature/woman|The Erl-King,2020-09-12T16:26:47.043403,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:26:27.436946,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/citation/,5axhd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5ae7db1e8b9c007de94ea7/,5f5ae7db1e8b9c007de94ea7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5axhd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5axhd
