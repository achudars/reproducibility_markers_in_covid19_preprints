Compared to most previous studies that employ organization-centric networks where ties stand for hyperlinks, collaborations, or coalitions, the new approach projects organization-public relationships and public-public relationships onto interorganizational ties. By doing so, it 1) brings publics back into networked public relations research; 2) presents organizations and publics—the two most important subjects of public relations research—equally in the same network, 3) drives literature further away from a dyadic view of relationship management, and 4) constitutes one of the first techniques that can analyze direct and timely consequences of organization-public relationships in the network ecology. To demonstrate the new approach, the network of publics overlap is introduced and applied to US-based LGBTQ advocacy groups. The essay also discusses the theoretical inquiries needed to further dual-projection networks, and invites scholars to create novel ways to incorporate publics into their network studies using dual projection.",TRUE,FALSE,dual projection|network ecology|public-public relationships|public relations|publics|social networks,2019-03-01T12:46:22.171334,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-01T12:45:56.051187,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e10|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Public Relations and Advertising|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/citation/,f9cxs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3rfby/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/relationships/node/,3rfby,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c789dcf82a3950018cf6c18/,5c789dcf82a3950018cf6c18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f9cxs/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2019.03.004,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f9cxs

In criminal law, the distinction between knowledge and recklessness, and the use of broad jury instructions concerning other belief states, presupposes a common and stable understanding of what those belief-state terms mean. But a wealth of empirical work at the intersection of philosophy and psychology—falling under the banner of “Experimental Epistemology”—reveals how laypeople’s understandings of mens rea concepts differ systematically from what scholars, courts, and perhaps legislators, have assumed.

As implemented, mens rea concepts are much more context-dependent and normatively evaluative than the conventional wisdom suggests, even assuming that jurors are following jury instructions to the letter. As a result, there is less difference between knowledge and recklessness than is typically assumed; jurors consistently “over”-ascribe knowledge to criminal defendants; and concepts like “belief,” “awareness,” and “conscious disregard” mean different things in different contexts, resulting in mens rea findings systematically responsive to aspects of the case traditionally considered irrelevant to the meaning of those terms.

This Article provides the first systematic account of the factors driving jurors’ ascriptions of the specific belief states criminal law invokes. After surveying mens rea jury instructions, introducing the Experimental Epistemology literature to the legal literature on mens rea, and examining the implications of that literature for criminal law, this Article considers ways to begin bridging the surprisingly large gap between mens rea theory and practice.",TRUE,FALSE,belief|criminal law|epistemology|experimental philosophy|jury instructions|knowledge|legal theory|mens rea|negligence|recklessness|willful ignorance,2019-02-28T19:28:07.986373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T19:00:01.038631,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,James Macleod,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/citation/,d9zg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c78238082a3950019d0e657/,5c78238082a3950019d0e657,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d9zg2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d9zg2

There are several factors such as social, economic, political, demographic, natural, and livelihood strategies that causes to the vulnerability of the status of household food security. Therefore examining the vulnerability of these factors is essential to identify the reason and recognize the most vulnerable communities. This study is an attempt to study on the vulnerability of the factors of household food availability and its linkage with climatic changes in Malaysia. The study is based on primary data collected in the months of July – October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 low income households from East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on cluster random sampling technique. The study found that the vulnerability of the factors of household food availability has decreased statistically significantly over the last five years period in Malaysia for the factors of effectiveness of food distribution process, road and transportation facility for food distribution process, availability of expected food in the local market, sufficiency of expected food in the local market, and stability of food supply in market. The mean values of the current status of the factors of household food availability differ significantly at 1% significance level from the scenario of 5 years ago. However, most of the cases climatic issues were found less responsible for the changes of these factors. Though Malaysia is adversely affected by climatic change, the factors of food availability are not affected yet remarkably. This study suggests that the food security programs need to be integrated with climatic change adaptation programs to ensure more effective and sustainable household food security in future, especially among the poor and low income group.

Several research works have been conducted on WP values of different yields, tools and technologies to improve WP. Most of the studies on water productivity considered the crop productivity using limited water resource and searched for better technologies for improving crop water productivity. Researchers also concentrated on improving irrigation efficiency or water use efficiency at field level for irrigation through water management and for yielding more crops. But there is a research gap in assessing values of water productivity in aquatic ecosystems especially floodplain areas. A floodplain area remains dry and flooded in two different seasons.

Here the involvement of private sector and community based organizations are also important to combat the short run, seasonal, and event related risk of food insecurity as well as for the development of appropriate mitigation and adaptation options to ensure sustainable food security at household level in Malaysia.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-28T18:55:27.315297,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T18:54:46.296580,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/citation/,uazj2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dh5p9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/relationships/node/,dh5p9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c776ba68d5d98001a3de4e4/,5c776ba68d5d98001a3de4e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uazj2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uazj2

Therefore, under the capitalistic system, the efficient markets have already failed to protect the rights of investors that have led to chronic capital market crashes and failure to achieve efficiency, justice, fairness, accountability, fair distribution of benefits, and a rational behaviour among investors. However, recently, Islamic financial institutions and markets have been emerging, which stand on the Shariah provision – the guided way to behave rationally or guided rationality. Based on the empirical experiences and evidences of both market systems, this paper discusses and compares the performances of the markets under the theoretical arguments of “rationality”, “quasi-rationality”, and “guided rationality”. This paper suggests that capital market based on guided rationality under the Islamic System can be a better alternative over the conventional market system.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-28T18:54:47.599889,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T18:54:21.069940,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/citation/,83ekv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d4zrs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/relationships/node/,d4zrs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c776ad18d5d98001b3816b3/,5c776ad18d5d98001b3816b3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83ekv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/83ekv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/83ekv

As a consequence, the issue of sustainable waste management has become an important priority for policymakers and other stakeholders of the society. Although there are potentials to recycle up to 80 per cent of the total dry wastes collected, currently most of them are deposited into various landfill sites. Waste treatment facilities are also insufficient in the country. The government has introduced SWM Act 2007 along with other initiatives to improve the waste management scenario, but more needs to be done to be able to recycle and treat a major portion of the wastes. Based on studies on the state of Selangor in Malaysia, this paper this paper attempts to analyse the waste management scenario of Malaysia and the problems and prospects of waste recycling there. The paper will help the policy makers, waste management strategists, local administrators and researchers in the field to formulate sustainable policies and identify further areas of study in the relevant field.",TRUE,FALSE,environment|landfills|Malaysia|Recycling|solid waste|waste management,2019-02-28T19:29:28.479738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T19:03:06.397664,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/citation/,2csqj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zbgfe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/relationships/node/,zbgfe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c77675a82a395001acdeb92/,5c77675a82a395001acdeb92,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2csqj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2csqj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2csqj
