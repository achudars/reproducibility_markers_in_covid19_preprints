Experimental evidence from Germany,"Although observational studies from many countries have consistently shown that motherhood negatively affects women’s wages, experimental findings on its effect on the likelihood of being hired are less conclusive. Motherhood penalties in hiring have been reported in the US, the prototypical liberal market economy, but not in Sweden, the prototypical social-democratic welfare state. Based on a field experiment in Germany, this study examines the effects of parenthood on hiring processes in the prototypical conservative welfare state. My findings indicate that job recruitment processes indeed penalize women but not men for having children. In addition to providing theoretical explanations for why motherhood penalties in hiring are particularly likely to occur in the German context, this study also highlights several methodological and practical issues that should be considered when conducting correspondence studies to examine labor market discrimination.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|field experiment|gender|parenthood,2018-09-09T17:42:02.760518,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-09T17:41:40.451160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Lena Hipp,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/citation/,4a68p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mtq5x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/relationships/node/,mtq5x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b94f156a58a18001d799080/,5b94f156a58a18001d799080,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a68p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4a68p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4a68p,NA

Therefore, parents' education may imbue children with high expectations but not always the means to fulfill them. Swedish data on children of immigrants from over 100 countries of origin support this view: net of parents' absolute years of schooling, a high rank in the sending country benefits children's aspirations, attitudes, and educational choices, but not their test scores or school grades.

According to media and informant reports, untold thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslims have been and are being detained in clandestine political re-education facilities, with major implications for society, local economies and ethnic relations. Considering that the Chinese state is currently denying the very existence of these facilities, this paper investigates publicly available evidence from official sources, including government websites, media reports and other Chinese internet sources. First, it briefly charts the history and present context of political re-education. Second, it looks at the recent evolution of re-education in Xinjiang in the context of ‘de-extremification’ work. Finally, it evaluates detailed empirical evidence pertaining to the present re-education drive.

I argue that what can help dictators maintain elite cohesion is concentrating patronage within institutions capable of controlling access to a broad array of rents. I make this claim based on an original online survey of 2,496 firm managers and employees in Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia in which I randomized the type of offers made by political parties to companies for support in a hypothetical election. I show that Egyptian businesses, who have suffered the most under the authoritarian regime, counter-intuitively are also the most supportive of the country's rulers compared to businesspeople in other Arab countries. The underlying mechanism that best explains these findings is the Egyptian military's dominance in the control of patronage relative to the greater institutional diversity found in other countries.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-07T09:35:24.992573,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-07T09:34:38.268935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/citation/,mrfcu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xbyh9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/relationships/node/,xbyh9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b91ccba2c77f700177c90ef/,5b91ccba2c77f700177c90ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrfcu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrfcu,NA

By applying a feminist standpoint framework, we argue that an ethic of “objectivity” and a privileging of the unattached researcher creates an experiential gap in the disaster literature whereby researchers who themselves experience disaster are undervalued and underrepresented. We analyze reflexive accounts by disaster researchers to show what epistemological barriers emerge from conventional processes of inquiry and the systematic disadvantaging of local, affected researchers. We also study patterns in articles by “outsider” and “insider” researchers, focusing on differences and similarities in research questions, reflexivity, relationships with and access to participants, and larger theoretical goals.

This limited scope obscures important ways in which these factors could have been related to voting behavior among other racial sub-groups of the electorate, as well as participation in the two-party contest in the first place. Using the vote-validated 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey, merged with economic data at the ZIP code and county levels, we find that racial attitudes strongly explain two-party vote choice among white voters – in line with a growing body of literature. However, we also find that local economic distress was strongly associated with non-voting among people of color, complicating direct comparisons between racial and economic explanations of the 2016 election and cautioning against generalizations regarding causal emphasis.",TRUE,FALSE,2016|donald trump|economic distress|elections|racial attitudes|voting behavior,2018-09-06T16:37:45.378114,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T16:46:46.171456,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/citation/,un782,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kv6nw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/relationships/node/,kv6nw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b91546ce39d950015cc739b/,5b91546ce39d950015cc739b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un782/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/un782/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/un782,NA

It is a common assumption in this research area that people tend to be selective about the political information they expose themselves to and also to selectively process it. Selective exposure and selective perception processes are mainly based on the dominant political orientation of the recipient, which usually leads to a reinforcement of preexisting political perceptions and attitudes. We review recent research on selective exposure and perceptions and argue for greater involvement of findings in social psychology regarding differences in cognitive styles that underlie individual policy orientations and justify why and how these findings can promote the study of partisan selectivity in the reception of political communication. We conclude by highlighting theoretical and methodological perspectives arising from the proposed extension of research on selectivity in the process of receiving political communication.

The literature suggests that such disasters have the potential to spur greater environmentalism and environmental action, as residents make connections between global environmental change and local events.  However, the literature also suggests that residents in communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction might see technological disasters, like oil spills, as threats to their economic well-being, thereby limiting environmental reflexivity.  Given that Alberta is home of the tar sands, how might a flood disaster affect men’s environmental views, given both traditional notions of masculinity and men’s economic dependence on oil production?  Using a survey of 407 flood-affected residents of Calgary and in-depth qualitative interviews with 20 men directly impacted by the flood, this article demonstrates men’s decreased tendency to change their environmental views after the flood.  The qualitative data reveal that men justify this reluctance by shifting blame for climate change to the Global South, by arguing for the economic centrality of the tar sands for Alberta, and by discussing how a warming climate will largely be a positive outcome for Alberta.  The article concludes with discussion of relevance for environmental sociology and for public policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|complacency|disaster|environmental views|fossil fuels|gender|masculinity,2018-09-06T21:14:20.987542,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T21:14:09.253110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/citation/,hy9wt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bq4wj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/relationships/node/,bq4wj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9149eb57f3d1001a5fad99/,5b9149eb57f3d1001a5fad99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy9wt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hy9wt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hy9wt,https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2017.1295837
