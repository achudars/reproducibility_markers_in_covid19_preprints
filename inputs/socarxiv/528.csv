Theoretical explorations of the potential influence of this institutional arrangement abound; however, empirical evidence as the influence of such an arrangement on local public sector remains relatively thin.

Using a county-level dataset from 1972 to 2012, this commons problem is explored.

Exclusionary Discipline and the Production of Delinquency,"There is growing concern that school discipline policies increase children’s risk of contact with the justice system, promoting a “school-to-prison pipeline.” Despite the popularity of this concern, the evidence of discipline’s impact on arrests remains limited in important ways. The current study leverages a unique combination of data sources to provide plausibly causal evidence that school suspensions mark a turning point in children’s lives, increasing their risk of later arrest. Combining fifteen years of data from the Fragile Families and Childhood Wellbeing Study with contextual data on neighborhoods and schools, I estimate that suspended children are two times more likely to experience an adolescent arrest than otherwise similar children. Although suspended children experienced significantly greater escalations in delinquency than their peers, post-suspension changes in behavior are unable to explain the association between childhood suspension and adolescent arrest. Instead, the data are consistent with a labeling theory of school sanctions, whereby suspended children face higher rates of subsequent discipline in ways that are largely unexplained by their reported behavior. At a time when juvenile arrests can permanently alter youth’s risks and opportunities, this study highlights an important mechanism by which schools shape inequality across the institutions that govern children’s lives.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:48:11.081294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-10T21:56:45.305535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/citation/,28qk4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/syue6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/relationships/node/,syue6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5accf936151710000f5d505c/,5accf936151710000f5d505c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/28qk4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/28qk4

To provide the first prospective evidence on sexual minorities’ early childhood peer victimization experiences and estimate the extent to which victimization histories explain adolescent mental health disparities.
Methods. Longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Childhood Wellbeing Study, a population-based cohort of children born in twenty American cities between 1998 and
2000, were used. Multivariate regression analyses examined peer victimization at ages 5,9 and 15 and anxiety/depression at 15. Teens reported sexual minority status during interviews conducted between 2014 and 2017.
Results. Compared to their peers, sexual minorities experienced similar rates of victimization at age 5 but higher rates ages 9 and 15. Over and above current bullying, prior victimization predicted worse outcomes on three clinically validated diagnostic scales for anxiety/depression. Results were consistent using parent and child reports. Despite sexual minorities’ elevated rates of bullying, only about 20% of their mental health disparities were explained by peer victimization.
Conclusions. Sexual minorities’ bullying risk begins years earlier than previously documented and persists into adolescence. Victimization prevalence estimates based on
adolescents’ recent experiences will substantially underestimate lifetime exposure to victimization.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:48:11.039593,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-10T21:55:39.255907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/citation/,rgm84,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kjv65/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/relationships/node/,kjv65,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5accf78a6a3691000f992913/,5accf78a6a3691000f992913,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rgm84/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rgm84

They use their legislative repertoire to help them to cater to the interests of their principals. In this paper, we argue that we need to move beyond treating electoral systems as monolithic entities, as if all legislators operating under the same set of macro-rules shared the same set of incentives. Rather, we need to account for within-system variation, namely, candidate selection rules and individual electoral vulnerability. Using a most different systems design, we turn to Germany, Ireland, and Portugal to leverage both cross-system and within-system variation. We use an original dataset of 345.000 parliamentary questions. Findings show that candidate selection rules blur canonical electoral system boundaries.

Using novel methods and a data set of 1.5 million research papers in the scholarly database JSTOR published between 1779 and 2011, the authors find that nearly 10 percent of references are self-citations by a paper’s authors. The findings also show that between 1779 and 2011, men cited their own papers 56 percent more than did women. In the last two decades of data, men self-cited 70 percent more than women. Women are also more than 10 percentage points more likely than men to not cite their own previous work at all. While these patterns could result from differences in the number of papers that men and women authors have published rather than gender-specific patterns of self-citation behavior, this gender gap in self-citation rates has remained stable over the last 50 years, despite increased representation of women in academia. The authors break down self-citation patterns by academic field and number of authors and comment on potential mechanisms behind these observations.

But  how this hierarchical structure affects  income distribution has not been widely studied. To remedy this situation, this paper presents a new model of income distribution that explores the effects of social hierarchy. This 'hierarchy model'   takes the limited available evidence on the structure of firm hierarchies, and generalizes it to create a large-scale simulation of the hierarchical structure of the United States economy. Using this model, I conduct the first quantitative investigation of hierarchy's effect on income distribution. I find that hierarchy plays a dominant role in shaping the tail of US income distribution. The model suggests that hierarchy  is responsible for  generating the power-law scaling of top incomes.  	Moreover, I find that hierarchy can be used to unify the study of personal and functional income distribution, as well as to understand historical trends in income inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,capital as power|economic modeling|hierarchy|income distribution|income inequality|power|power law,2018-07-02T11:48:07.950494,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-09T04:14:39.668404,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/citation/,s3y2m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3bsvt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/relationships/node/,3bsvt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5acac0ccbc673f00131596d9/,5acac0ccbc673f00131596d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3y2m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s3y2m/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s3y2m

Sociologists, in responding to the imperative to make their work more influential, must go beyond doing “public sociology” to embrace doing sociology “in public” (Healy 2017). Rather than using public engagement primarily for publicity – to make our research matter – we should use engagement to help us do research that matters in the first place. Next, I caution that the drive to be professionally rewarded for public intellectualism is fraught with conflicts that may be irreconcilable. To be a public intellectual today requires being both public in one’s intellectual life and intellectual in one’s public life, and for academics in the era of the “market university” (Berman 2011), trying to get paid for that leads to a neoliberal trap. Finally, I argue for a move beyond personal strategies toward the development of the open scholarship as an institutional response that ultimately may be responsible for sociology’s survival.",TRUE,FALSE,academia|media|open access|open scholarship|open science|public intellectuals|public sociology|social media|sociology,2018-07-02T11:48:07.454791,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-08T14:16:48.638675,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/citation/,v27xk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7q6e4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/relationships/node/,7q6e4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aca2377bc673f0010156ad1/,5aca2377bc673f0010156ad1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v27xk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v27xk/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0094306119827954,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v27xk
