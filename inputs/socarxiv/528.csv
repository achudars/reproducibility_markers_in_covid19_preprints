We argue that even though population policy is almost certainly effective in principle, it is not necessarily practically viable or desirable, for three reasons. First, in order to be as effective as possible, population policy would necessarily (also) target Western developed nations, but debates on population policy, paradoxically, seem to focus on developing countries. Second, reducing future life years is potentially a great moral burden because it means reducing the total amount of future happiness; systematically preventing people from coming into existence is a difficult moral problem. Third, population policy as a risk mitigation strategy is somewhat self-defeating because the successful mitigation of some risk by means of population policy reduces the very utility of mitigating that risk. These three problem areas do not make population policy categorically unacceptable, but any use of population policy for the mitigation of global risks is in need of strong and evidence-based justification. Given that the resources available for mitigating global risks are limited, we believe that they should be used on more promising risk mitigation approaches and strategies.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|existential risks|global risks|population policy|risk mitigation,2018-10-29T23:08:21.241000,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-29T23:05:37.855906,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/citation/,y4zm5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fjpvz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/relationships/node/,fjpvz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd742f2133ddd001a343004/,5bd742f2133ddd001a343004,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4zm5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4zm5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4zm5,NA

This paper  examines which conceptual steps are necessary for determining the extension, or the appropriate scale, of relevant spatial environments when contexts can be analytically disaggregated into context elements. Adequate models of scale need to specify not only the distance-dependent relevance of context elements but also their distribution and an adequate combination. In this way, it becomes possible to understand why non-monotonic patterns in scale-related context effects have been repeatedly found in spite of common assumptions of distance decay in relevance. In many cases, a distance-related maximum of (aggregate) context relevance can be expected, so that there is an “optimal” range for the measurement of context effects. It is also important to distinguish between applications in two- and three-dimensional space. This general model helps to specify the steps necessary for the determination of spatial context patterns and to identify unrealistic assumptions.",TRUE,FALSE,context effects|distance|distance decay|egohoods|environment|MAUP|scaling|spatial context,2018-10-29T23:18:24.498740,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-29T23:06:23.851582,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/citation/,d4mu7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v6kxa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/relationships/node/,v6kxa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bcb6231a334dd0016f2550b/,5bcb6231a334dd0016f2550b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d4mu7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d4mu7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d4mu7,NA

The combination of ‘big data’ and advances in computational techniques such as machine learning (ML) could be a boon for urban accessibility studies, yet their application remains limited in this field. In this study, we aim to more robustly relate socio-economic factors to healthcare accessibility across a city experiencing rapid population growth, using a novel combination of clustering methods. We applied a powerful ML clustering tool, the self-organising map (SOM), in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA), to examine how income shifts over time (2016–2022) could affect accessibility equity to healthcare for senior populations (65+ years) in the City of Surrey, Canada. We characterised accessibility levels to hospitals and walk-in clinics using door-to-door travel times, and combined this with high-resolution census data. Higher income clusters are projected to become more prevalent across the city over the study period, in some cases incurring into previously low income areas. However, low income clusters have on average much better accessibility to healthcare facilities than high income clusters, and their accessibility levels are projected to increase between 2016 and 2022. By attributing temporal differences through cross-term analysis, we show that population growth will be the biggest accessibility challenge in neighbourhoods with existing access to healthcare, whereas income change (both positive and negative) will be most challenging in poorly connected neighbourhoods. A dual accessibility problem may therefore arise in Surrey. First, large senior populations will reside in areas with access to numerous, and close-by, clinics, putting pressure on existing facilities for specialised services. Second, lower-income seniors will increasingly reside in areas poorly connected to healthcare services; since these populations are likely to be highly reliant on public transportation, accessibility equity may suffer. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply a combination of PCA and SOM techniques in the context of urban accessibility, and it demonstrates the value of this clustering approach for drawing planning policy recommendations from large multivariate datasets.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-28T00:22:42.020409,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-28T00:22:25.530380,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/citation/,yngx4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cez4w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/relationships/node/,cez4w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd4a8f6e40bf10019f3804c/,5bd4a8f6e40bf10019f3804c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yngx4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yngx4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yngx4,NA

Drawing on interviews and ethnographic observations among a racially and socio-economically diverse sample of Boston-area defendants and among legal officials, the author describes defendants’ differential styles of engagement with lawyers and the court. Whereas defendants who have reason to trust their lawyers often delegate legal authority to them in consequential moments and experience relative ease of court navigation as a result, defendants who have reason to mistrust their lawyers often withdraw from lawyers and seek to acquire their own legal expertise, such as knowledge about criminal law and procedure learned in their communities, in jail, and through observation. Defendants’ assertive use of self-acquired expertise, however, is discouraged by the court system, often drawing punitive responses from legal officials and constraining defendants’ legal choices. Thus, the cultural styles and resources that scholars have shown to benefit the privileged in mainstream institutions such as schools and workplaces have negative repercussions in the criminal courts, often to the detriment of less-advantaged defendants. The author discusses implications for research on criminal court disparities and sociological theory on culture, expertise, and navigation across a range of institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Class|Courts|Criminal Justice|Expertise|Inequality|Institutions|Law|Lawyers|Professions|Race|Trust,2018-10-28T00:21:43.196509,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-28T00:21:27.559993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Matthew Clair,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/citation/,brf3d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eb9n6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/relationships/node/,eb9n6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd36f648b330000192173d1/,5bd36f648b330000192173d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/brf3d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/brf3d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/brf3d,NA

As such, teaching may have contributed to the build-up and maintenance of cultural complexity in human societies. However, teaching is also a strategic and dynamic behavior that likely evolves in response to both the type of knowledge taught and the social context. We explore this possibility through an evolutionary analysis of teaching fidelity, or the fidelity of knowledge transmission during teaching. 

For our analysis we developed two models, a two-trait model and a quantitative trait model to explore how selection on teaching fidelity varies across different types of knowledge. In our two-trait model we use exoteric and esoteric knowledge categories and specify them mathematically to ask how they may affect the evolutionarily-favored level of teaching fidelity. We show that the evolutionarily-stable transmission fidelity by teachers varies widely across knowledge types and depends on the number of students belonging to a teacher. Esoteric knowledge often converges on either very high or very low fidelity teaching practices, although what is taught often follows majority belief. Along exoteric knowledge domains, increasingly high-cost (or less beneficial) behaviors predicts teachers to impart the more benign (or more beneficial) behaviors. Further, when interactions between students are characterized by a social dilemma, increases in the fraction of the student population taught by a single teacher should increase the frequency with which teachers impart the group-beneficial behavior.

Undocumented immigrants in this study recognize the precarity of their legal status, but they sometimes feel their existence off the radar of the U.S. immigration regime promotes their long-term presence in the country. Meanwhile, documented immigrants in this study describe the relative stability of their legal status, but they sometimes view their existence on the radar of the U.S. immigration regime as disadvantageous to their long-term presence in the country. To explain these perspectives, the article develops the concept of “system embeddedness” to denote individuals’ perceived legibility to institutions that maintain formal records. System embeddedness is one mechanism through which perceived visibility to the U.S. immigration regime entails risk, and perceived invisibility safety, for some immigrants. In this way, the punitive character of the U.S. immigration regime can overwhelm its integrative functions, chilling immigrants out of opportunities for material and social well-being through legalization and legal status in ways that likely have intergenerational consequences. More broadly, system embeddedness illuminates how perceived legibility to a record-keeping body combining punitive and integrative goals—even absent punitive experiences with other systems of social control—represents a mechanism of legal stratification for subordinated populations.",TRUE,FALSE,deportation|documented immigrants|immigration law|Latin America|qualitative methods|removal|surveillance|system avoidance|system involvement|undocumented immigrants,2018-10-28T00:19:22.307947,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-28T00:19:11.772110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Other Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Asad L.

Often, scholars focus on how one or two of their socio-demographic traits compare to their participants and how it may influence field dynamics. Research that incorporates an intersectionality perspective, which brings attention to how people’s multiple identities are entwined, also has a long history. Yet, researchers tend to pay less attention to how we strategically draw on our multiple social positions in the course of field work. Drawing on data I have collected over the past several years and extending recent sociological work that goes beyond a reflexive accounting of one or two of researchers’ demographic characteristics, I argue that each researcher has their own ethnographic toolkit from which they strategically draw. It consists of researchers’ visible (e.g., race/ethnicity) and invisible tools (e.g., social capital) and ties qualitative methodologies to research on how culture is strategically and inconsistently used.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|methods|positionality|reflexivity|toolkit,2018-10-26T13:12:21.705256,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T13:11:35.227743,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,SAGE,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/citation/,r9tdy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9ze3s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/relationships/node/,9ze3s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd275828b33000019207e9e/,5bd275828b33000019207e9e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9tdy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r9tdy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r9tdy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138118805121

Despite considerable recent qualitative research in management and organizational theory on the role of politics in decision making and managing organizational change, quantitative research in this area has stalled. The reason for the lack of progress is not theoretical, but rather methodological; researchers lack empirical tools for understanding basic processes of coalition formation, evolution, and conflict in organizations. We introduce a novel method for modeling politics in organizations that builds on the model of intra-organizational conflict in March (1962), which we call “subcoalition cluster analysis” (sCCA). The main contribution of sCCA is that it identifies subcoalitions with consistent preferences that are in conflict without placing additional restrictions on the structure of individual preferences. We apply sCCA to two cases, Wikipedia and the Baseball Writers’ Association of America and show how leadership would benefit from conceiving of their membership as competing subcoalitions instead of individuals with idiosyncratic preference disagreement. Finally, we compare the performance of sCCA to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering and demonstrate that sCCA does a better job identifying latent structure in the data when the organization consists of more subcoalitions, when individual preferences are not perfectly aligned with those of their subcoalition, and when observations are missing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-26T01:33:04.354144,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T01:32:48.729481,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,Scott Ganz and Daniel Schiff,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/citation/,5kufg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e4kz5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/relationships/node/,e4kz5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd25528e40bf10018f1609e/,5bd25528e40bf10018f1609e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kufg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kufg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kufg,NA

It was a “flood” which was “too vast to be dealt with as a whole,” in the words of the British Quarterly Review in 1859. It remained “a vast wilderness … its extent unknown, its ramifications unfathomed” for subsequent researchers, according to Michael Wolff in a 1971 issue of the Victorian Periodicals Newsletter. By the numbers for newspapers alone, stamped titles increased almost five-fold from 550 in 1846 to 2,440 in 1906. Simon Eliot estimates the number of copies those newspapers rising from 16 million in 1801 to over 78 million by 1849. By the end of the era, the Daily Mail claimed to circulate a million copies of each issue on its own. The periodical archive has sprawled even more with its gradual digitization which, while representing only a fraction of nineteenth-century print, still astonishes its researchers. “We are now on the brink of a further, exponential expansion … as vast new quantities of hitherto inaccessible records and texts become available for digital searching,” Patrick Leary claimed in 2004. In many ways, nineteenth-century newspapers and periodicals set the very terms for not simply “digital searching” but quantitative methods, having only ever existed as “numbers” (a term for individual issues) in a state of impossible profusion, seeming to welcome computational approaches to the unruly digital archive.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-26T01:32:21.788430,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-26T01:31:54.793527,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/citation/,hwcpq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gwr4p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/relationships/node/,gwr4p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd23ed58b330000192058dd/,5bd23ed58b330000192058dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hwcpq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hwcpq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hwcpq,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.026
