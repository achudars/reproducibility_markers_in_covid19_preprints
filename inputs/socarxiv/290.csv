Establishment of effective and transparent communication during the crisis phase is extremely important to reduce the after-effects of the events. In recent times, fake news or news with fabricated content have emerged as major threats of communications during and and post -disaster phase. The present study critically evaluates the nature and consequences of fake news spread during the four major environmental disasters in recent era (Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Keralan Flood, Amazon Forest Fire and African Ebola Epidemic) and prepared a framework for present COVID-19 Pandemic. The criticality and potential threat created by the fake news have been quantified and analyzed through the timeline of news spreading. It has been  observed that the adverse impact related to the African Ebola Epidemic was highest due to its multiple fake news origin sites, both online and offline propagation methods, well fabricated content and relatively low effort on containment. However the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing disaster expected to have a long- drawn impact covering most countries in the world with combined consequences hence it tends to overtake all other events.  Policy recommendations have been prepared to combat the spreading of fake news during the present and future environmental disasters. The importance of the study relies on the fact that the number of environmental disasters will increase in future and strategy for risk communication during the time is still not explored adequately. In addition the study will contribute significantly for understanding the present status of information paradigm for COVID-19 and helps in preparing region-specific real-time contingency measures for effective risk communication.",TRUE,FALSE,CORONA|COVID-19|Fake News|Risk Communication,2020-04-21T05:02:35.557251,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T01:30:16.124383,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dee|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Emergency and Disaster Management|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/citation/,wdr5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9de465510dfb000ad1ca51/,5e9de465510dfb000ad1ca51,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdr5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wdr5v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wdr5v,NA

However, content-driven assessment can tend to support teaching- or teacher- centered instruction. Adult learning and educational psychology theories suggest that instead, assessment should be aligned with learning, not teaching, objectives. To support the alignment of assessments with instruction in higher education, the Assessment Evaluation Rubric (AER) was developed. The AER can be utilized to guide the development and evaluation/revision of assessments that are already used. The AER evaluates four features of an assessment: its general alignment with learning goal(s); whether the assessment is intended to/effective as formative or summative; whether some systematic approach to cognitive complexity is reflected; and whether the assessment (instructions as well as results) itself is clearly interpretable. Each dimension (alignment; utility; complexity; clarity) has four questions that can be rated as present/absent (or yes/no), or, using a three-level ordinal scale describing “present-useable”, “possibly present - needs clarification”, and “absent”. Other rating methods can also be conceptualized for the answers to the AER’s 16 questions, depending on the user’s intent. Any instructor can use the AER to evaluate their own assessments and ensure that they -or new assessments in development - will promote learning and learner centered teaching.",TRUE,FALSE,assessment|faculty development|higher education|learner-centered teaching|teaching and learning,2020-04-21T05:02:25.852212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T01:27:16.931188,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/citation/,bvwhn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9dd37b43016606dca084c2/,5e9dd37b43016606dca084c2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvwhn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bvwhn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bvwhn,NA

Therefore, measuring 1605 US-based customers of US publicly traded companies, this study has found that NPS was positively and significantly correlated with financial performance. However, two other dimensions of customer experience, technical innovation (TI) and perceived usability (PU) outperformed NPS with stronger correlations demonstrating both the value of NPS but also perhaps the need to look beyond.

Many studies have reported a high prevalence and various determinants of DV; however, there is a gap of consolidated evidence on this problem. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of DV from systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Methods: We systematically searched ten major databases and additional sources to retrieve systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting prevalence or determinants of DV, published as peer-reviewed journal articles in English language till October 13, 2019. We extracted and synthesized the findings, reported the prevalence of DV, and categorized the determinants of DV using the socioecological model.
Results: We found 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Most of these studies were conducted in developed countries with a majority of adolescent and young adult participants. Studies reported varying prevalence of physical, sexual, psychological/emotional, and technology-assisted DV ranging from 0.1% to 57.5%, 0.1% to 64.6%, 4.2% to 97%, and 5.8% to 92%, respectively. The determinants of DV at different socioecological levels, including individual behavior, substance abuse, psychiatric conditions, experiencing violence and maltreatment; interpersonal factors like family and peer relationships; community and neighborhood characteristics; patriarchy, culture, and socioeconomic equalities were reported.
Conclusions: These findings suggest a high burden of DV among young populations, who are vulnerable to various socioecological determinants of DV. Future research should examine how these factors influence DV and multi-level interventions should be adopted to address the same.",TRUE,FALSE,Aggression|Dating Violence|Gender Based Violence|Intimate Partner Violence|Meta-analysis|Partner Violence|Sexual Violence|Systematic Review|Umbrella Review,2020-04-21T05:03:20.870899,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-20T16:13:32.286091,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Counseling Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dad|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Applied Behavior Analysis,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/citation/,n6hsk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9dbecad6973506bbbd9b52/,5e9dbecad6973506bbbd9b52,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6hsk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n6hsk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n6hsk,NA

It arises from a research project, ENLIVEN – Encouraging Lifelong Learning for an Inclusive and Vibrant Europe (2016-2019), funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme, which focuses on interdisciplinary approaches to influencing policy formation. An evaluation of a local employment support service for young people unemployed for 12 months or more was undertaken by computer and social scientists within ENLIVEN. Two data mining approaches were utilised: proximity to the labour market indicator analysis and decision tree analysis of programme participant employment outcomes. An important question considered was whether the decision tree analysis would support anecdotal experience from local practitioners which indicated the relevance of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to their work within the context of the most vulnerable young people.  It was found by decision tree analysis that young people who possess good levels of confidence, mental health and who have worked before are more likely to secure a sustained employment outcome.

The Changing Livelihood of US Online Workers in Times of COVID-19,"We draw on data from the Online Labour Index and interviews with freelancers in the United States securing work on online platforms, to illuminate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic’s global economic upheaval is shuttering shops and offices. Those able to do so are now working remotely from their homes. They join workers who have always been working remotely: freelancers who earn some or all of their income from projects secured via online labour platforms.

Evidence from Longitudinal Time-Diary Data,"How children use their time is critical for their health, emotional, and cognitive development. Studies typically find that parental divorce lowers child development, due to a decline in parents’ monetary and time resources. Yet, little is known on how parental separation affects child time use. This study fills this relevant knowledge gap by using prospective time-diary data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), a unique survey following children’s time use across six waves (N = 14,862 observations from 3,719 children). Results from both random and fixed effects models provide four main findings: (i) mother-child time increases dramatically after parental separation, at the expense of children’s time with two parents, while father-child time stays low both before and after parental separation; (ii) after parental separation, children slightly decrease their time in educational activities and increase substantially their time in unstructured activities; (iii) boys’ developmental time use is harmed by parental separation to a higher degree than girls’; and (iv) parents in high socio-economic backgrounds tend to compensate more effectively for the potential negative consequences of divorce by investing more time in children, compared to parents in unprivileged social backgrounds. Our findings have important implications for family policy. Results point to the need of spreading joint custody to improve gender equality in parental childcare time after divorce, as well as promoting greater support for boys and disadvantaged families in dealing with the adverse effects of parental union dissolution on children’s daily routines, development, and life chances.",TRUE,FALSE,Child development|Divorce|Gender|Life-course|Social stratification|Time-use,2020-04-21T05:03:22.411154,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-20T16:11:39.428325,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/citation/,8j37s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9d5f5dd6973506a1bd8bf0/,5e9d5f5dd6973506a1bd8bf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j37s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8j37s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8j37s,NA

A form of resistance widely available is to break those rules. We review instances of rule-breaking in scientific authorship to allow for a redefinition of the concept of civil disobedience in the context of academic research, as well as the conditions on which the label applies. We show that, in contrast to whistleblowing or conscientious objection, civil disobedience targets science’s injustice on a more systemic level. Its further development will ease critical evaluation of deviant actions as well as helping us evaluate deviance, defiance and discontent in science beyond issues of authorship. However, empirically, civil disobedience in science engenders uncertainties and disagreements on the local status of both act and label.",TRUE,FALSE,authorship|civil disobedience|organisation of science|protest|science governance,2020-04-21T05:02:39.729575,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T01:28:46.670069,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/citation/,4r2x6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9d5c7e43016606aba068e4/,5e9d5c7e43016606aba068e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r2x6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4r2x6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4r2x6,https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2020.1756787

As a gauge of the seriousness of these concerns some have suggested that current levels of some of these indicators have not been seen in the US since the time of the great depression. This paper explores how General Collective Intelligence, a recent innovation in group decision-making systems, might reliably generate the economic growth needed to avert such a crisis where not reliably achievable otherwise. Current group decision-making systems, whether choosing a human decision-maker, consensus voting on decisions, or automated decision-systems such as conventional collective intelligence, have been suggested to lack the capacity to maximize more than a very few group outcomes simultaneously due to specific limitations. Since impact on collective well-being is determined by impact on an open (unbounded) set of outcomes, this implies lack of the capacity to maximize the necessary range of impacts on well-being for groups if that range is too broad. If so, the breadth of impact required to achieve sustainable “green” economic development while simultaneously solving hunger, solving the environmental degradation that consensus has linked to climate change, as well as providing maximal access to healthcare, education, and other resources, may not be reliably possible with current decision systems. General Collective Intelligence or GCI replicates the adaptive problem solving mechanisms by which nature has demonstrated the ability to optimally respond to an unlimited set of problems, and by which nature has demonstrated the ability to potentially increase sustainability per unit of resources by orders of magnitude so that life is reliably self-sustaining. This paper explores why GCI can potentially be used to reliably drive self-sustaining economic growth to revive economies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and why GCI has the potential to reliably drive a transformation to sustainable green economies while doing so.",TRUE,FALSE,economic development|GCI|General Collective Intelligence|green growth|sustainable development,2020-04-21T05:03:24.280023,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-20T16:01:14.820651,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/citation/,arw7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9d50a8f1353506b3d599c3/,5e9d50a8f1353506b3d599c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/arw7c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/arw7c,NA
