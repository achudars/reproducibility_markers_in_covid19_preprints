Based on the error-analysis carried out by recent research, subject–verb agreement (SVA) is one of the most frequent errors committed by students. To overcome this problem, teachers should significantly improve students’ mastery of SVA in the English language through effective teaching methods. Therefore, this research was conducted to explore the effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in teaching SVA among rural Sarawak learners. In this study, 35 Form 4 students were selected from a secondary school in the Belaga District, Sarawak as the research participants. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used as data collection tools. Overall, findings demonstrated that students showed positive feedback after the intervention was implemented. Results of this research will hopefully provide insights to secondary school students, teachers and the community in the cooperative teaching and learning of grammar.",TRUE,FALSE,Kagan cooperative learning structures|subject-verb agreement|teaching English,2019-07-21T21:21:03.391211,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:20:51.657540,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/citation/,n2ukr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2be14145253a001c41bc9e/,5d2be14145253a001c41bc9e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2ukr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n2ukr/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n2ukr

They engage in different types of writing and reading on social media in everyday life. But little is known about the material resources and concrete activities they drew on as they read and write in English on their preferred social media. This ethnographic case study aims to examine the material resources and concrete activities of a group of Saudi female undergraduates majoring in English Translation in a university in Saudi Arabia as they use English on social media. This study particularly aims to answer this research question: What material resources and concrete activities do Saudi female undergraduates employ as they read and write in English on social media? A total of eleven female Saudi undergraduates took part in this research. Online observation, focus group interviewing, semi-structured interviews, informal conversations and online logbook of English usage were employed over a three-months period to collect data. This study draws on Literacy Studies (LS), that understand literacies as social practices involving more than technical skills. Analysing the data thematically revealed that these undergraduates drew on three main approaches: English-spelling checking approaches, English grammar-checking approaches and English-meaning checking approaches. The study recommends that language learners are encouraged to use Google app, Google Translate app, Dictionary apps and the COCA website to correct, craft and improve their English.

Yet, to attain such skills, teachers need to reshape their teaching practices to be in conformity with the principles of modern education that champion active learning methodologies. The present paper argues for the necessity of rethinking the traditional teacher-centered methods in teaching English literature in the Algerian context as they tend to reduce students’ active participatory roles in learning. In response to this, a number of suggestions have accordingly been put forward to enable students reach more independency in dealing with literature.

This research is conducted to                    describe the correlation between lecturers’ language style and students’ academic. As one of the aspects of forming academic self-efficacy, language style has an important role because someone who can get information verbally about his ability in mastering certain duty tends to do more efforts. In addition, it makes him more diligent in doing a duty. Also, language style positively increases the student's self-confidence and vice verse. This research involves seventy students who fill in the questionnaire about the lecturer language style and academic self-efficacy scale.  Data were analyzed by using simple linear regression analysis. The result of the research shows that lecturer’s language style has a coefficient of determination of 23.5% towards the students’ academic self-efficacy. Finally, this research affirms that positive lecturer language style can improve the students’ belief towards their ability while the negative language style can weaken the students’ self-efficacy.

It investigates the value of EFL within the Saudi education system and surveys the extent to which English has been adapted to suit the needs and customs of Saudi citizens. While focusing on major policy issues related to planning and implementing EFL instruction, the paper examines how stakeholders have worked to preserve Saudi culture, Arabic, and the structure of Saudi society. It seeks to determine whether EFL courses in Saudi schools meet the needs of students, the results of which are compared with Saudi policies on language teaching. The study then presents observations on the compatibility of teaching practices and policies, as well as the issues involved.

The development of the pragmatic, integrated method of Communicative Circle builds upon the linguo-didactic, integrated, and activity approaches, and the theory of three levels of awareness of learning. These perspectives are reflected in the integration of listening, reading and speaking skills, three stages of teaching, regarding the psychological phases of awareness of the studied material, and the choice of tasks according to the students’ abilities, basic skills and the tempo of learning. In the course of study students are gradually offered more complicated tasks for training speaking and texts for reading and listening, and the whole teaching process builds upon broadening some professional and scientific knowledge of students at a technical university. The efficiency of the developed Communicative Circle method is verified in the course of a two-year experiment. The results of teaching by the traditional program (developed on the basis of the Federal State Standards) and by the method of the Communicative Circle are compared and evaluated. The article concludes a greater efficiency of the developed method which reveals itself in higher English proficiency, confidence, and wider professional purview of the students who were taught by the Communicative Circle method.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-21T21:17:42.284409,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:17:18.577528,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/citation/,aktrg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bd01545253a001c41af8e/,5d2bd01545253a001c41af8e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aktrg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aktrg

To fill this gap, this empirical study investigates the beliefs of Taif University’s teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) about their feedback practices and their perception of the impact that these practices have on students' performance. An opinionnaire of 18 items was designed with closed-ended questions. A five-point Likert’s scale was employed to measure three subscales: teachers’ beliefs and practices about their corrective feedback; types of oral corrective feedback used by EFL teachers; and their perception of students’ uptake. The survey was administered to fifty-seven English as foreign language (EFL) teachers at the English Language Centre (ELC), Taif University who were asked to fill in an online survey regarding their oral corrective feedback practices in the classroom. Their responses were analysed quantitatively. The findings of the study were that the participants allocated highest preferences to the techniques of elicitation, repetition and recast, and that they frequently use them in their classrooms.",TRUE,FALSE,beliefs|ESL/EFL teachers|oral corrective feedback techniques|practices,2019-07-21T21:17:02.909348,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:16:36.641918,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/citation/,xw28t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bcf44114a42001608c0dd/,5d2bcf44114a42001608c0dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xw28t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xw28t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xw28t
