Modern packages for persistent homology often construct Vietoris–Rips or other distance-based simplicial complexes on point clouds because they are relatively easy to compute. We investigate alternative methods of constructing these complexes and the effects of making associated choices during simplicial-complex construction on the output of persistent-homology algorithms. We present two new methods for constructing simplicial complexes from two-dimensional geospatial data (such as maps). We apply these methods to a California precinct-level voting data set, demonstrating that our new constructions can capture geometric characteristics that are missed by distance-based constructions. Our new constructions can thus yield more interpretable persistence modules and barcodes for geospatial data. In particular, they are able to distinguish short-persistence features that occur only for a narrow range of distance scales (e.g., voting behaviors in densely populated cities) from short-persistence noise by incorporating information about other spatial relationships between precincts.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|elections|geospatial data|persistent homology|topological data analysis|voting,2019-01-30T15:57:02.062932,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-30T15:56:01.388626,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/citation/,9mbdn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5111d8568329001b842b7f/,5c5111d8568329001b842b7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9mbdn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9mbdn,NA

Immigration, Adolescent Language Aptitude and New Evidence on Books in the Home from Four European Countries","Evidence suggests that books in the childhood home impacts children’s educational and occupational attainments. Previous research finds this ‘book effect’ after conditioning on parental socio-economic status and national context. Human and cultural capital theories offer plausible explanations for this book effect. However, mechanisms underlying the book effect remain empirically illusory. Drawing on previous findings, we develop theoretical arguments that human and cultural capital are not the entire story behind the book effect. Designing a formal model of all these processes, we test our claims using immigration, language and country-context to adjudicate between mechanisms hypothesized by the theories. Using CILS4EU data in four countries and structural equation modeling to test these theories’ models against the data, we find the direct effect of books does not differ between native and immigrant adolescents in predicting 9th grade language aptitude scores. Moreover, this effect does not vary much by country. Reading habits and primary language spoken at home explain only part of the effect suggesting the presence of books measures something operating independently and in addition to human and cultural capital.

Starting in the 1950s, various traditions in economics purported to explain the concept of “inflation inertia”. Contributions ranging from Celso Furtado and M.H. Simonsen to James Tobin anticipated key aspects of what later became the inertial inflation hypothesis, building it into either mathematical or conceptual frameworks compatible with the then contemporaneous macroeconomic theory. In doing so, they bridged the analytical gap with the North-American developments whilst maintaining the key features of the CEPAL approach, such as distributional conflicts and local institutional details. These contributions eventually influenced the second moment of the monetarist-structuralist controversy that unraveled in the 1980s. The paper also highlights how later works by structuralist economists gradually stripped the inertial inflation approach of its previous substance and form, thereby unearthing tensions among Latin-American structuralists that led to the eventual decline of this research program.",TRUE,FALSE,|Celso Furtado|inertial inflation|James Tobin|Latin America stabilization,2019-01-28T23:06:41.750236,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-28T23:06:09.924582,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,History of Economics Society,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/citation/,gxy4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4f0875bf723100197a642b/,5c4f0875bf723100197a642b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gxy4n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gxy4n,NA

However, the actual trend in the 21st century has been the opposite. Knowledge spillovers have fuelled urbanisation and pulled job-seekers into large cities, increasing the gap to deprived rural areas. We argue that new assemblages of technologies and social practices, so-called ’online labour platforms’, have recently started to counter this trend. By providing effective formal and informal mechanisms of enforcing cooperation, these platforms for project-based remote knowledge work enable users to hire and find work across distance. In analysing data from a leading online labour platform in more than 3,000 urban and rural counties in the United States, we find that rural workers made disproportionate use of the online labour market. Rural counties also supplied, on average, higher skilled online work than urban areas did. However, many of the most deprived regions of the country did not participate in the online labour market at all. Our findings highlight the potentials and limitations of such platforms for regional economic development.",TRUE,FALSE,Information and Communication Technology|Online Labour Platforms|Platform Economy|Regional Development|Spatial Inequality|Urban-Rural Divide,2019-01-28T01:13:06.369363,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-28T01:12:34.575666,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,The authors,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/citation/,wbxd7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4dad2e568329001b809e97/,5c4dad2e568329001b809e97,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbxd7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wbxd7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wbxd7,NA

Executive Report.,"In an era of mass migration, social scientists, populist parties and social movements raise concerns over the future of immigration-destination societies. What impacts does this have on policy and social solidarity? Comparative cross-national research, relying mostly on secondary data, has findings in different directions. There is a threat of selective model reporting and lack of replicability. The heterogeneity of countries obscures attempts to clearly define data-generating models. P-hacking and HARKing lurk among standard research practices in this area.
This project employs crowdsourcing to address these issues. It draws on replication, deliberation, meta-analysis and harnessing the power of many minds at once. The Crowdsourced Replication Initiative carries two main goals, (a) to better investigate the linkage between immigration and social policy preferences across countries, and (b) to develop crowdsourcing as a social science method. The Executive Report provides short reviews of the area of social policy preferences and immigration, and the methods and impetus behind crowdsourcing plus a description of the entire project. Three main areas of findings will appear in three papers, that are registered as PAPs or in process.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|crowdsourcing|immigration|open science|replication,2019-01-26T16:05:08.404177,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-26T16:04:43.436628,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/citation/,6j9qb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4c7a53bf7231001778e01d/,5c4c7a53bf7231001778e01d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j9qb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6j9qb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6j9qb,NA
