The impetus for this research was the practitioner’s dissatisfaction with the current practice of introducing the grammatical concept of the English passive and its subsequent results. Framed within the sociocultural theory of cognitive development, this paper investigates the effectiveness of concept-based instruction (CBI). As a pedagogical approach, CBI targets a learner’s internalization of the concept of a language constituent that assists the learner with the meaning making abilities of sentences where the English passive is used. Twenty-two university students enrolled in an ESP course participated in the study. The data was collected through the teacher’s observations, students’ artifacts, and students’ feedback on the effectiveness of CBI. Data analysis reveals the effectiveness of CBI in heightening learner awareness of the concept of a language constituent, developing learner knowledge of the English passive, and improving their meaning-making abilities at the phrasal and sentential levels.",TRUE,FALSE,concept-based instruction (CBI)|language constituents|meaning-making abilities|sociocultural theory|Vygotsky,2021-01-14T00:29:25.284638,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T23:30:54.611354,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/citation/,6mzgr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fff771bba010904e58910e8/,5fff771bba010904e58910e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6mzgr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6mzgr/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6mzgr

To expand the existing literature in OCB and EI, this study investigated the levels and relationship of OCB and EI of college English teachers in an English language institute in the western region of Saudi Arabia. It tried to answer the following research questions: 1) What is the level of OCB and EI of the respondents? 2) Is there a significant relationship between the respondents’ OCB and EI? Using descriptive correlational research design with adapted organizational citizenship behavior and emotional intelligence scales as data gathering instruments, this study found that the respondents had very high level of OCB. Specifically, the findings revealed that the OCBs under altruism, civic virtue, and compliance dimensions were rated as very high while those under sportsmanship and courtesy were assessed as high.  Findings also indicated that the EFL teachers had high level of EI. Lastly, the study proved that there was a significant, positive relationship between the respondents’ organizational citizenship behaviors and emotional intelligence. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the respondents have the potential to excel in their job and are able to contribute to overall institutional effectiveness. This asset should be enriched and sustained by implementing more relevant OCB/EI-friendly policies and practices that support conducive school climate, transformational leadership, and emotional well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-14T00:30:23.698508,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T23:31:16.437297,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/citation/,xhgs6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fff75bd86541a0515149b97/,5fff75bd86541a0515149b97,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xhgs6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xhgs6/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xhgs6

Through an open discussion of social scientific theory and recent work in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology, I underline the case for a more inclusive ‘mainstream’ sociolinguistics that both accommodates interdisciplinary and descriptive research methods alongside traditional variationist practice, and is also open to a critical re-evaluation of the scope of the discipline which is able to encompass language user agency and socio-political discourse as part of a ‘socially-constituted’ approach to sociolinguistics across the board.",TRUE,FALSE,language activism|linguistic anthropology|linguistic ethnography|qualitative/quantitative methods,2021-01-14T00:32:24.274978,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T23:31:50.228783,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics,James K Puchowski,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/citation/,w7v9p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fff3b8786541a04d71515af/,5fff3b8786541a04d71515af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7v9p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w7v9p/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w7v9p

Specifically, we assess the extent to which two factors identified in the literature as relevant to individual expression – elite frames and movement mobilization – seem to influence claimsmaking in three mediated forums - Twitter, Letters to the Editor and op-eds that appear in mainstream news outlets, and emails sent to Rick Scott about the legislation.

These resources have led to an increase in tourist visits. However, the increase has led to the growth of tourist facilities such as accommodations and restaurants. The construction of tourist facilities has transformed agricultural and plantation lands' functions to support tourism and new settlements. This transformation has caused changes in traditional architecture even though these cultural productions are interesting for tourists. This phenomenon is an architectural challenge for the people to maintain the cultural productions, but at the same time, they can accommodate tourist activities in the village. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the traditional settlement and architecture of the bamboo, including socio-cultural conditions, village morphology, building typology, and problems faced.

Adopting a qualitative approach, this paper dived into the literature and identified key factors which act as impediments to EBF among working mothers in this region - insufficient breastfeeding breaks in the workplace, lack of breastfeeding spaces and short maternity leaves, birth by caesarean section, poor lactation, poor maternal health, and poor spousal and societal support.",TRUE,FALSE,Developing Countries|Exclusive Breastfeeding|Infant Nutrition|Public Policy|Working Mothers|Workplace,2021-01-14T00:37:50.581332,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T23:34:04.116639,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/citation/,akbr9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fff0db5ba010904b988fee8/,5fff0db5ba010904b988fee8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akbr9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/akbr9/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.01.246,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/akbr9

The independence of the countermeasures with the state's ability to make and prepare its own defense equipment needs without guaranteeing defense equipment products from other countries. In order to discuss the problem of efforts to increase the capability of the national shipyard industry, theories that support the strategy theory, the theory of capacity building and the theory of policy implementation are used. The method used in qualitative analysis is qualitative analysis, namely the existing phenomena regarding the national shipbuilding industry and qualitatively explains the data obtained from literature studies to gain an understanding of the strategies for dealing with them. The results of the analysis found that to ensure the implementation of policies to increase the capacity of the national ship industry, the formulation of defense policies needs to be guided by the principles, namely: integrated between all existing national resources (integrative), interactive communication between related entities (interactive), commitment a special transparency system in order to avoid leakage (transparency), requires an entity as the driver's authority to regulate authority (control), a special system to measure the performance accountability that has been implemented (accountability).

Although distinctly modern in its use of social media platforms, the current methods align with old Soviet doctrine using information warfare to gain a strategic edge over competitors. Using the WARP framework, a heuristic tool for understanding narrative weaponization for mobilization and radicalization, we focus on Russia’s use of narratives to exacerbate existing cleavages in American society and to undermine US national security. Using data from Twitter’s comprehensive data archive of state-backed information operations, we find that military and patriotic narratives constitute one of the most frequently deployed narrative sets (second only to Trump), comprising 12.9% of the 1,357 million English-language tweets. The Russians weaponized these narratives and profiles to support or smear a variety of political actors and to escalate the urgency of various social causes. Moreover, these narratives actively recruited audiences to embrace New War cultural identity, an anti-government ideology focused on defending their families from an increasingly hostile state and world. Using a variety of persuasive strategies, the Russians leveraged these narratives to deliver emotionally resonant signals about allies and perceived enemies, both foreign (e.g. Muslims and immigrants) and domestic (e.g. government officials and the media), and to set the groundwork for potentially violent mobilization. Impersonating military profiles increased message resonance, and posturing as credible sources may have aided normalization and legitimization of New War cultural identity and divisive messaging. We conclude the Russians used military and patriotic narratives and profiles to wrap anti-government sentiment in patriotic trappings and to set the stage for Americans to engage in armed domestic conflict.",TRUE,FALSE,influence operations|information operations|information war|narrative|narrative networks|new warrior|russia|social media|twitter|weaponized narrative,2021-01-13T22:33:22.195485,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T13:21:27.548289,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/information-operations.html,not_applicable,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/citation/,b9a2m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffef0a0ba0109048888fa72/,5ffef0a0ba0109048888fa72,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9a2m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b9a2m/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b9a2m
