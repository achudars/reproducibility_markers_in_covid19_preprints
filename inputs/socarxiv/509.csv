Applying group threat theory and contact theory, I propose that race, age, education, political views, and religiosity all affect how people view immigration. To test the hypotheses, I analyze data from the 2014 General Social Survey, in which adults living in households in the United States are randomly selected and interviewed. A subset containing 1,022 respondents who answered every question relevant to this study is selected from the 2014 GSS. The univariate analysis shows that most Americans do not agree with the statement that immigrants undermine American culture, and that Americans are divided on whether the number of immigrants should be increased nowadays. The multivariate result indicates that education and political views are the most significant predictors of how one views immigrants and immigration policies, correspondingly, while race, age, and religiosity have no statistically significant relationships with either dependent variable. Statistical findings support the hypothesis that the more liberal a person is, the more likely the person is to agree that immigrants do not undermine American culture and to say that the number of immigrants nowadays should be increased. Contact theory is consistent with the result of this study. However, the findings also demonstrate that immigration is a complicated issue. This study is valuable in understanding the acceptance of immigrants across demographic groups.

As social media continues to grow and evolve, sociologists have begun to explore its effect on an individual’s everyday life. I propose that the more social media platforms that an adolescent uses, the more they will experience negative effects on their social relationships. Using survey data from 786 respondents living in the United States, ages 13 to 17 and collected by the Pew Research Center in 2014 and 2015, regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between social media usage and its effect on quality of adolescent social relationships, controlling for sex and age. The bivariate results show a statistically significant, positive but weak association between number of social media platforms used and the social relationship experience scale. In the multivariate results, this association was still statistically significant. Additionally, the multivariate results show that the control variables, sex and age, have no significant effect on one’s social relationship experience. Therefore, these results show that the more social media platforms used, the more negative a social relationship experience an adolescent will have. The results support the hypothesis and indicate that adolescents who interact with a higher number of social media platforms will experience an increased negative effect on their social relationships. In future studies, researchers should investigate how specific social media platforms influence social relationships.

This study proposes that being born in the United States, and having one, or both, parents born in the United States will increase pro-gun tendencies. Previous literature focuses on the importance of demographics associated with gun attitudes within the United States, but does not examine the potential relationship between the country itself and its gun culture. Using the gun control module from the 2006 General Social Survey (N = 1179), a pro-gun scale was created for the purpose of measuring pro-gun opinions. The correlation results show that those born in the United States score higher on the pro-gun scale than those born outside of the United States. However, the iterative regression shows this relationship is mediated by political views. The number of parents born in the United States does not have an effect on where the respondent lands on the pro-gun scale. The results support the notion that being born in the United States increases the likelihood of scoring higher on the pro-gun scale.

A standard that is hard to meet. Being light-skinned, blonde and blue-eyed is the benchmark of beauty, of what is most desirable. But is that really what it takes to be attractive in America? This research examines the relationship between race, birth-place, ethnicity and self-rated attractiveness. The General Social Survey (2016) provides the quantitative data for this study. While past literature explores the connections between identity, self-esteem, and attractiveness, it does not explore the intersection of different identifying characteristics. Group position and Colourism approaches provide the theoretical foundations for the hypothesis and the research conducted in this paper. These theories also help explain why certain physical attributes are more valuable in American society. So how does the privileging of White America, specifically when measuring beauty, influence one’s opinion of their own attractiveness? This study has 1,622 respondents—non-institutionalized, English or Spanish speaking adults, who live in the country. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the individual and collaborative relationships between the variables. The results from this study concur with some of findings from the literature. Yet, they do not support the hypotheses. The results concluded that being Non-White had little influence on one's self-rated attractiveness. Similarly, birthplace and ethnicity had no statistical significance. However, the controls, age and sex, are significant.

The main results of the current study show that additional siblings reduce wealth by about 27 to 39 percent. Parental wealth moderates the association so that sibship size is more negatively associated with filial wealth when parents are wealthier.

Using cumulative inequality theory, which posits that the disadvantage or advantage associated with one’s social location impacts life trajectory and perceptions of such, I propose that level of optimistic outlook in individuals from low-income backgrounds increases their chances of financial success in adulthood. Analyzing data from the 2016 General Social Survey, a nationally representative survey administered to randomly sampled adults in the U.S., I examine a subset of 1,269 individuals from backgrounds of far below average or below average family income levels. In doing so, I determine how optimistic attitudes, regarding matters such as personal agency and success, influence whether the individual may obtain a higher degree of financial success in adulthood compared to those of their families. Findings indicate that higher levels of optimism are associated with greater family income levels, with level of education and marital status as the biggest predictors of adult financial standing. With higher educational attainment, optimistic outlook increases, perhaps due to an increase in career opportunities and pathways to success. These findings show how influential education may be on intergenerational income mobility, however, they also provide insight on how disadvantage, including being a person of color; being divorced, separated or a single-parent; as well as how many children one has, may create limitations on educational attainment and effects on outlook. Such findings call attention to the need for greater financial and educational assistance programs, due to their impact on outlook and subsequent life course.",TRUE,FALSE,inequality|mobility|optimism|outlook|poverty|sociology,2018-12-20T15:54:21.703431,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-20T15:54:01.338630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/citation/,akjqu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1a92d4e4e3b300187bddd3/,5c1a92d4e4e3b300187bddd3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akjqu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/akjqu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/akjqu,NA

Analyses of such competition draw heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) statistics. ​In and of themselves, however, FDI statistics are merely a quantification of the value of ​firms’ ​investment projects and tell us little about the heterogeneity of these projects and the distinct patterns of competitive dynamics between countries they generate. Here, we create a more sophisticated understanding of international competition for FDI by pointing out its variegated nature. To do so, we trace the “great fragmentation of the firm” to distinguish between five categories of FDI: manufacturing affiliates, shared service centers, R&amp;D facilities, intermediate holding companies​, and top holding companies. Using a novel combination of firm-level and country-level data, we identify for each of these different categories which European Union member states are most successful in attracting it, what macro-institutional and tax arrangements ​are present in them​, and what benefits they receive from it in terms of tax revenues and employment creation. In this way, we ​are able to identify five distinct “FDI attraction profiles” and show that competition increasingly ​appears to take place amongst subsets of countries that compete for similar categories of FDI.",TRUE,FALSE,attraction profiles|determinants of FDI|FDI|foreign direct investment|foreign direct investment; tax competition; transnational corporations; great fragmentation; attraction profiles|great fragmentation|intra-group trade|tax competition|transnational corporations,2018-12-19T11:36:01.303246,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-19T11:35:40.467504,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/citation/,7ugbr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7xwtb/,7xwtb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1a1d38ddd8c7001a4aea1f/,5c1a1d38ddd8c7001a4aea1f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7ugbr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7ugbr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7ugbr,NA

In today’s times, Ayurveda requires scaled-up production and scientifically proven products. This in turn requires trans-disciplinary methodologies for product development that can leverage the existing knowledge in both Ayurveda and modern science and technology. Product Development in general has two steps, research and development (R&amp;D) and manufacturing. Among the two, unlike in allopathic drugs, R&amp;D in Ayurveda for new product development is in its nascent stage, lacking adequate references on modern methodologies. Such references are important in particular to new comers in the sector. The scope of this paper is to provide a write-up of the Ayurvedic processes and to propose a guideline for Ayurvedic product development that can be used for R&amp;D. The methodology proposed was arrived at by referring selected classical Ayurveda texts and interacting with traditional and modern bio-medicine experts at the Trans-disciplinary University, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. The study documents three components in Ayurvedic product development namely product formulation-identification, product formulation-preparation and product formulation-validation which can be used to design the Ayurvedic product development methodology. The study also provides the role of different stakeholders in the Ayurvedic product development process. The study provides a methodology to design new Ayurvedic products before being taken up for manufacturing.",TRUE,FALSE,Ayurveda|Ayurvedic product development|Ayurvedic research and development|Herbal drug|Methodology|traditional medicine,2018-12-19T11:36:28.192739,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-19T11:36:05.042334,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/citation/,dnejz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c19aa55ddd8c7001b4a1c96/,5c19aa55ddd8c7001b4a1c96,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnejz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dnejz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dnejz,NA
