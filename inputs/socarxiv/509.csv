We chose the discipline of Bibliometrics / Scientometrics as a case study. After carrying out a series of keywords searches in Google Scholar Citations (GSC) and Google Scholar (GS), 813 relevant researchers were identified. Researchers were further classified as core (those who work mainly on Scientometrics) or related (those who work in other disciplines, with occasional incursions into Scientometrics). Additional information about these researchers was collected from other platforms (ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley, and Twitter). Up to 28 author-level indicators were collected about each researcher, as well as data about up to 100 of the most cited documents displayed in their GSC profile. The document-level data from all GSC profiles, as well as the data extracted from the keyword searchers in GS, was aggregated to create a list of the top 1000 most cited documents in the discipline. This document collection was further processed to generate a list of the most influential journals and publishers in the discipline. The results are accessible from the “Scholar Mirrors” website, which presents the results in four sections: authors, documents, journals, and book publishers.

Much less is known however about the sources of people’s different beliefs. I argue that scholarship is hampered by a lack of consensus regarding the conceptualization and measurement of inequality beliefs, in the absence of an organizing theory. To fill this gap, in this paper I develop a framework for studying the social basis of people's explanations for inequality. I propose that people observe unequal outcomes and must infer the invisible forces that brought these about, be they meritocratic or structural in nature. In making inferences about the causes of inequality, people draw on lessons from past experience and information about the world, both of which are biased and limited by their background, social networks, and the environments they have been exposed to. Looking at inequality beliefs through this lens allows for an investigation into the kinds of experiences and environments that are particularly salient in shaping people’s inferential accounts of inequality. Specifically, I make a case for investigating how socializing institutions such as schools and neighborhoods are inferential spaces that shape how children and young adults come to learn about their unequal society and their own place in it.

Abstract
This essay is about constructive ways for responding to criticism about how your style as a person of power or privilege may be hurting others in your teaching or advising. Along the way it addresses the broader problems of taking criticism in general and of cultural differences in interaction styles. The punchline is about trying to be who you are (no personality transplants) in a way that respects both yourself and others and helps make your environment feel inclusive for more marginalized people. Sections discuss five issues: (1) Pay attention to issues of power and privilege. (2) Let people know you are open to criticism, including suggestions for classroom strategies. (3) Respect cultural and personal differences in interaction style and look for ways to communicate across these differences with attention to have this interacts with issues of power and privilege. (4) Learn general principles of taking criticism, including staying calm, listening for understanding, asking for time to think and reflect on critiques. (5) Pay attention to the problem of destructive criticism, including destructive relationships and bad classroom dynamics. The conclusion emphasizes that including formerly marginalized groups inevitably produces cultural conflict. Openness to criticism is a way forward for bridging differences in cultural and personal styles.",TRUE,FALSE,criticism|cultural difference|cultural styles|diversity|inclusion|personal styles|teaching,2018-07-02T11:55:47.077310,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-10T19:59:40.781064,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/citation/,gvcmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mshpv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/relationships/node/,mshpv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1d36bfec24e20011b70b56/,5b1d36bfec24e20011b70b56,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvcmk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvcmk,NA

A landscape of words as opposed to a landscape of code (Thrift &amp; French, 2002), language-as-data becomes material in ways very different from both print and spoken word; its physicality represented in bits, bytes and circuitry, and its limits and variations mediated and governed by the processes which order, sort, move and index it. By virtue of their reproducibility and enhanced means of dissemination, digitised words can have paratextual – and often political – agencies and excesses beyond their linguistic function. Using examples of online search, dictionaries and translation, the paper will imagine how context as a kind of space might be produced, constructed and limited, how competing actors contribute tactically (de Certeau, 1984) to the (in)visibility and (im)mobility of the linguistic data in the searchable database, and how these actors negotiate the conflicting interests of money, efficiency and truth (Lyotard, 1984) in the geo-linguistic spaces of the web. With a geography of (con)text thus imagined, the mathematical and binary logics that construct and mediate the language within it are also clearly exposed. The paper goes on to discuss how creativity and originality might be restricted by ongoing processes of quantification and monetisation of language, before concluding that digitised language falls somewhere in the middle of a structuralist/post-structuralist critique; being at the same time both free from and constrained by the geographies of context.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithm|critical theory|digital geography|geographical software studies|google|language|search engines,2018-07-02T11:55:46.096865,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-09T17:41:15.846946,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography,Pip Thornton,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/citation/,q9kjw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sqw74/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/relationships/node/,sqw74,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1baea6b796ba000d3ff143/,5b1baea6b796ba000d3ff143,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9kjw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q9kjw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q9kjw,NA

Residential segregation studies in Indian cities have relied on ward-level data. We demonstrate in this paper that wards cannot approximate an urban neighborhood, and that they are heterogeneous. For a typical ward, the neighbourhood-ward dissimilarity index is greater than the ward-city dissimilarity index. Using 2011 enumeration block (EB) level census data for five major cities in India – Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai –  we show how patterns of caste-based urban residential segregation operate in contemporary India. We also present the first visual snapshot of caste-based residential segregation in an Indian city using georeferenced EB level data for Bengaluru. Besides implications for policy, our analysis also points to the need for publicly available, geospatially-linked neighborhood-scale census data that includes data on economic class for a spatial understanding of economic and social stratification within Indian cities.

This is due to a combination of historic and contemporary government policies, the agency of Indigenous people, and the constraints placed on residential location by the interaction of the housing and labour markets. This study traces the trajectory of Indigenous residential segregation in 60 Australian towns and cities, using census data from 1976 to 2016. Segregation is measured using the index of dissimilarity and the threshold method. Indigenous residential segregation has been declining steadily since 1976 nationally. However, there has been a great deal of variation in segregation trajectories among towns and cities.  In Sydney and Melbourne, segregation remained relatively high over the study period. The level of segregation in 1976 appears to be related to the geographical remoteness of the town, with remote towns generally having lower levels of segregation in 1976. Segregation has been decreasing most rapidly in regional towns in New South Wales and Queensland. Finally, this study has found a long-run increase in the proportion of Indigenous residents living in highly Indigenous neighbourhoods, consistent with the increasingly close settlement of Indigenous people in Australian towns and cities. This trend is at odds with the apparent decrease in segregation found when segregation is measured using the index of dissimilarity. Detailed case studies may be required that examine how concrete historical geographies and policy legacies combine with contemporary housing markets to produce the configuration of segregation that we see today.",TRUE,FALSE,cities|Indigenous Australians|neighbourhoods|residential segregation|urban geography,2018-07-02T11:55:45.216678,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-09T02:10:19.007777,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/citation/,2bkzx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dazfw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/relationships/node/,dazfw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1b31acb796ba000e40a4af/,5b1b31acb796ba000e40a4af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2bkzx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2bkzx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2bkzx,NA
