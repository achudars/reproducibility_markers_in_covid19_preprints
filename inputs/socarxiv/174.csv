Different critics place Collins’ works under the two main headings of detective fiction and sensation fiction. Such analyses have been generated by what is referred to as the ‘philological method’; that is, by an individual critic’s reading of the relevant material and their intuitive abstraction of generalizations from that reading. A problem with such an approach is that it is not objective, and it is therefore unreliable. The research question is thus asked in response to the subjectivity of previous genre classifications of the novels of Wilkie Collins and the lack of agreement among literary critics and researchers about such classifications. As such, I ask whether an objective and conceptually useful reading of the themes and subjects of Wilkie Collins’ prose fiction texts can be developed. As thus, computational lexical-semantics is suggested to understand the issues of thematic classification. For this purpose, vector space clustering (VSC) was used for capturing the lexical-semantic features of his novels and linking them explicitly to the relevant themes and genres. It is suggested that through this method, an objective, replicable, and reliable genre classification of Collins’ novels is possible. The results of this study can serve as a basis for future studies and criticisms of Wilkie Collins’ fiction.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-14T11:09:20.635959,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:08:57.877084,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/citation/,xd7te,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5afc4a777b700b4ab2df8/,5ee5afc4a777b700b4ab2df8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd7te/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xd7te/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xd7te

In this study, the author intends to explore the relationship between a school environment and teachers’ readiness for PD as well as how they perceive of the impact of PD on their professional and personal qualities, students’ performance, teachers’ career progression, and commitment to the job and workplace. The author administered semi-structured interviews with three English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers who are in their mid-career stage and work for private, American curriculum-based schools in Dubai. The results show that all three interviewees admit the positive influence of PD on their professional performance, personal qualities, students’ outcomes, career progression and commitment to the profession. How a progressive school culture would impact teachers’ inclination towards PD has also been brought to attention by the interviewees as a critical aspect. As potential areas of research on PD, it is recommended that students’ academic performance is to be looked into closely through examining their assessment results in order to muster tangible evidence on the significance of teachers’ PD.

As such, those who rely on the media to understand Islam are likely to develop negative preconceptions about the religion. This study aims to investigate how the non-western online newspapers use language in news coverage of Islam. Content analysis was used to collect and analyze the data. Using purposive sampling, Punch and Vanguard were selected from Nigeria while The Star and New Straits Times were selected from Malaysia. A total of 599 Islam-related news articles were collected from the selected newspapers using internet-based search from November 2015 until September 2016. The findings showed that almost half of the overall Islam-related articles conveyed negative tone toward Islam while very few conveyed positive tone. This shows that the language used in news coverage of Islam is inappropriate and sensational.

This paper investigates the use of discourse markers (DMs) in newspaper articles. By applying Fraser’s framework, this study aims at investigating the functions and positions of DM but (English) and its equivalent lakin (Arabic) in newspaper articles written by native and non-native speakers of English and Saudi and Egyptian speakers of Arabic. It also highlights the similarities and differences in the functions and positions of DMs but and lakin. This quantitative study adopts a corpus-based approach. The data consist of articles collected from 12 newspapers categorized as: Arabic language newspapers published in Saudi Arabia (Alriyadh, Al Jazirah, Al-Hayat) and Egypt (Al-Ahram, Al-Gomhuria, Eltahrir) and English language newspapers published in Saudi Arabia (Arab News, Saudi Gazette, Asharq Al-Awsat) and the USA (Washington Post, The New York Times, USA TODAY).  Findings demonstrate, first, that DM but is used frequently as a confirmation or addition marker by both native and non-native speakers. However, second, lakin, functions as the primary correction DM in standard Arabic. Moreover, third, the native Arabic speakers mostly share the same functions of using lakin despite different dialects they have.

The researcher of the current study tried to find ways to help solve the problems of students’ low achievement in reading comprehension tests.   Convenient sampling was used to select the two classes as the researcher herself was teaching them. The two classes of 20 students each constituted two experimental groups. One class was taught by the semantic mapping strategy, and the other was taught by students’ question-generation strategy.  A pre-posttests design was used in both experimental groups.  T-test computed on the pretests in both classes revealed that the groups were equivalent. The researcher established the validity and reliability of all the components of the study: the pre-posttest and the instructional material.  The instructional material selected for the intervention consisted of four extra expository texts, which are not written in students’ textbooks. After analyzing students’ results on the pre-post tests using two T-Test statistical analyses, it was found out that there were significant differences in the mean scores of each group on the pre-post tests, which reveals that each individual strategy has significantly influenced the group achievement.  In order to investigate which teaching strategy was significantly better than the other was a third T-test on the post-tests, mean scores in both groups were computed.

In an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) class, a teacher should adopt a specific teaching style to accomplish teaching goals. This study is an attempt to analyze and ascertaining the general principles and techniques of teaching EFL. The principal aim of the study is to highlight the needs of the learners and help the teachers to achieve their teaching goals with the planned learning outcome. The Eclectic Method of language teaching was introduced in the class to improve the communication skills and the academic performance of the learners. The Eclectic Method was pioneered in 1970 and gradually became very popular in English as a Second Language (ESL) and EFL classrooms. The Eclectic Method is a fusion of distinctive techniques of teaching and language learning approaches. This Method enables the language teachers to make it to all the learners despite the heterogeneity in their learning styles and intelligence. The author has used a Mixed Method Approach. The target group is female undergraduate students in the College of Science for Girls, King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). After implementing an Eclectic Method in the language classroom, the author finds that it helps in blending multiple activities of language learning. It allows students to receive individual attention amid a populated class. It further makes the students feel more motivated and confident. The result of the study prompted that the learners have improved significantly in all the four skills: Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing (LSRW) of language learning. The study signifies that the Eclectic Method works productively for every level of learners and makes learning easy and ingenious. The best part of this method is the teacher can design his/ her own teaching techniques based on the Proficiency and the competency of the learners to make learning more effective.",TRUE,FALSE,critical thinking skills|eclectic method|English proficiency|learner centeredness|needs analysis,2020-06-14T11:12:09.005072,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:11:29.485879,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/citation/,jvz8e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5a99c36a16d00a0e9a2f9/,5ee5a99c36a16d00a0e9a2f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvz8e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jvz8e/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jvz8e

Besides, learning strategies and learning styles also help to succeed in language learning. This paper discusses the learning style preferences of the first-year students at English Department Universitas Brawijaya Malang, Indonesia. There were two problems that attempted to be answered; first, what are the learning styles used by the students, and second, how influential is culture to the students’ learning. Barsch Learning Styles Inventory (BLSI) was employed as an instrument for 73 respondents. The results showed that more than 50% of respondents prefer visual mode, and the remaining were auditory learners, kinesthetic, and bimodal learners who combine visual and auditory modes in learning English. This might be affected by the culture of Indonesian learners that, in general, are accustomed to listening and reading instead of giving spaces to practice knowledge. Understanding the styles of learning can be very useful for the students to learn in the way they learn best through the activities. It will enable them to understand the course contents more comfortably so it can improve their motivation and language abilities, enjoy the learning process, decrease stress, and eventually get better achievement.",TRUE,FALSE,auditory|Barsch Learning Styles Inventory|bimodal|culture|kinesthetic|learning styles|visual,2020-06-14T11:12:17.624454,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:11:48.263631,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/citation/,j8vwe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5a8de44eab500a35247f4/,5ee5a8de44eab500a35247f4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j8vwe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j8vwe/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j8vwe
