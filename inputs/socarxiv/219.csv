There are challenges for both employers and employees, as employers look for strategies for the implementation of automation technologies and employees may have concerns about their employment being threatened by automation technologies.

The analysis finds that there are segments of the population defined by demographics and attitudes that are more fearful of the automation of their jobs than others. Additionally, we see that attitudes towards the dehumanizing effects of automation, peer-pressure, job automatability, and a person’s self-perception of professionalism are the main drivers of the fear of automation.

Internet / mobile phone addiction has become a major concern in today’s world. Current diagnosis methods are based on questionnaire survey. This typically involves asking the person concerned around 15-30 questions. Each response is allotted a specific score, and the range in which the final sum of the scores lies is used to determine his/ her level of addiction. These tests assume that the respondent is answering the questions honestly and that he/she has an exact idea about his/ her usage durations. In the present work, the validity of these assumptions is questioned.

Methods:
 Mobile phone usage is considered as a case study here. In this work, a group of 40 students in the age group of 13-18 (male= 52.5%, female= 47.5%) are surveyed. These students are asked a single question of how much do they think they use their phone. This information is compared with their actual phone usage times (obtained through the inbuilt usage tracking system of the phones, or similar such Apps). 

Conclusion:
Based on the present survey, it is found that on an average, the participants use their phones for 1.4 times longer than they think they do. The disparity between the estimated and actual usage time duration forms the basis of the proposed approach for assessing the level of mobile phone addiction.",TRUE,FALSE,addiction|internet|mobile phone,2020-04-19T05:03:21.483295,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T08:24:16.559983,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/citation/,vpm8k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e99b7304301660589a053eb/,5e99b7304301660589a053eb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vpm8k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vpm8k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vpm8k,NA

Prospect theory postulates that gain versus loss framing may affect preferences for different interventions. In a conceptual replication of Tversky and Kahneman’s seminal prospect theory, findings from surveys in the US and the Netherlands (N = 1,121) demonstrate that gain frames of the coronavirus promote support for risk-aversive interventions, whereas loss frames result in more support for risk-seeking alternatives. Beyond these preferences, gain frames yield slightly more support for strict interventions such as a lockdown than loss frames. Loss frames elicit stronger negative emotions, such as frustration and powerlessness. The experience of powerlessness, in turn, mediates the effects of loss versus gain frames on support for stricter interventions. Together, these findings indicate that framing the pandemic in terms of gains may be most effective in promoting support for the strict preventative measures that have been taken throughout the globe.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|discrete emotions|equivalency framing|gain framing|loss framing|policy support|prospect theory,2020-04-19T05:04:47.120072,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T08:20:11.109543,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,Michael Hameleers,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/citation/,7pykj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e999fa7f135350574d539c5/,5e999fa7f135350574d539c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7pykj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7pykj,NA

In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns, before, during, and after the pandemic, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics worked quickly with its academic partner, Pennsylvania State University, to offer guidance to land managers, recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across the country. In total, 1,012 outdoor recreationists were surveyed through the Leave No Trace community in a 48-hour window beginning on the morning of April 9th. Our hope is that the results of this rapid assessment will provide valuable information for managing the changing recreation use of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering insight for land managers as they work to protect the natural world.

In recent decades, this pillar of economic opportunity has eroded substantially. Though much has been written about the decline of manufacturing sectors in U.S. communities, the potential consequences for economic mobility, and stratification processes more generally, remain largely unexplored. In this study, I develop a conceptual framework linking the study of labor market change to economic stratification. I examine how structural changes to U.S. labor markets have altered opportunities for economic advancement in the U.S. I focus the analysis on birth cohorts in the 1980s, whose labor market entry spans the large-scale erosion of the manufacturing industry in the 2000s. I find strong evidence that declines in manufacturing employment have contributed to growing geographic disparities in upward intergenerational income mobility. Children raised in counties that experienced large contractions in manufacturing industries throughout adolescence experienced large economic penalties in adulthood via reduced levels of upward mobility.

Multivariate logistic regression results revealed that: (1) nonstandard work schedules and overworking were more prevalent in the Liberal, Southern European, and Central-Eastern European regimes than were in the Corporatist and Social Democratic welfare regimes, whereas underworking was the highest in the Liberal and Corporatist regimes; (2) fathers were more likely to work nonstandard schedules and overwork but less likely to underwork than were mothers, with the strongest gender gaps observed for the Liberal regime; (3) highly-educated parents were less likely to work nonstandard schedules and overwork but more likely to underwork, and this was more pronounced in the Southern European and Central-Eastern European welfare regimes; (4) compared to 2005, nonstandard work schedules were more prevalent in 2015, and both overworking and underworking were less prevalent in 2010; these trends varied across welfare regimes.",TRUE,FALSE,European Working Conditions Survey|parental work hours|welfare states|work schedules,2020-04-19T05:03:41.947475,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:47:49.515428,NA,NA,available,NA,https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/european-working-conditions-surveys-ewcs,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/citation/,d8mqv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e98a4804301660548a0426f/,5e98a4804301660548a0426f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8mqv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d8mqv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d8mqv,NA

We study how power sharing in Nepal's post-conflict transition affected the political capture of aid. We argue that despite the explicit inclusion of disadvantaged groups in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement from 2006 and the Interim Constitution, regions that neither aligned with the Maoist rebels nor the government during the civil war remained politically disadvantaged. A possible causal mechanism is the low threat potential of non-combatant groups, which results in under-representation during peace negotiations and in post-conflict institutions. We present statistical evidence that districts in which neither the government nor the Maoist rebels (CPN(M)) had political support during the conflict receive systematically less aid during the post-conflict period, regardless of economic need or damage caused by fighting. At the same time, support for the CPN(M) during the conflict is a significant predictor for higher post-conflict aid flows, but only in times when the CPN(M) holds government office.",TRUE,FALSE,Foreign Aid|Nepal|Post Conflict Reconstruction,2020-04-19T05:03:44.464597,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:47:08.092506,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/citation/,m79ax,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e98a3904301660547a03e75/,5e98a3904301660547a03e75,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m79ax/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m79ax/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m79ax,NA

Sectoral fragmentation of bilateral development aid and the role of the World Bank,"Bilateral aid projects continue to proliferate in an uncoordinated fashion, leading to fragmented aid delivery, despite high-level political promises to reign in the practice. Frequently absent in the academic and policy debates is an exploration of which policy venues can be effective in changing donor behavior. In this paper, we explore the role of the World Bank in promulgating best practices and enhancing sectoral coordination among bilateral donors. The World Bank's size, policy clout, and its own publicly stated commitments should make it a prime candidate for enacting measures that can help reduce bilateral aid proliferation and fragmentation. We concentrate on sectoral aid allocations and identify possible venues through which the World Bank can affect bilateral donor behavior and increase allocative efficiency, including as Lead Partner, Balancer, and by leading by example through Best Practices. Based on project-level data from 1998 to 2013, we find that bilateral donors and the World Bank allocate projects in a complementary fashion into the same sectors. Furthermore, World Bank and bilateral project numbers move together, and there is some evidence that bilateral donors emulate World Bank behavior. There is no evidence that World Bank activities help to reduce bilateral aid fragmentation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-04-19T05:03:42.113558,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:46:33.051895,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/citation/,gt49c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e98a107d697350549bd9e40/,5e98a107d697350549bd9e40,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gt49c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gt49c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gt49c,NA
