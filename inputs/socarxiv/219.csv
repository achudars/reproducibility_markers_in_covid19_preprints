However, due to limited environmental legislation and enforcement, many industrial companies have directly released wastewater into waterways without proper treatment, leading to the problem of heavy metal pollution. As a result, chronic exposure to heavy metals is considered the main threat to human health in China. To solve the issue of heavy metal pollution, China’s government used top-down centralised state-centric governance. However, state-centric governance is limited in that it requires a long response time. In this paper, the theory of network governance is instead applied to analyse the heavy metal pollution problem, and a new model, the voluntary governance model, is introduced. With the voluntary governance, the China government will be better able to improve the efficiency of the governance process and provide a healthier environment to the citizens.",TRUE,FALSE,Environmental management|Network governance|State-centric governance|Voluntary governance|Water pollution,2020-07-23T05:12:34.366174,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-23T05:12:10.872268,FALSE,NA,no,"If someone would like to use the data, please contact with the author.",,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/citation/,apbm3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f19036e86a05500480e14c7/,5f19036e86a05500480e14c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apbm3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/apbm3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/apbm3

Ergo, consumer spending, a factor of GDP, is stifled and negatively impacts the economy (Frizell, 2014, p. 22). This study examined the relationship between student loan debt and the probability of a recession in the near future, as well as the effects of proposed student loan forgiveness policies through the use of a created model. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website (FRED) was used to extract data regarding total GDP per quarter and student loan debt per quarter (""Federal Reserve Economic Data,"" 2019). Through the combination of the student loan debt per quarter and total GDP per quarter datasets, the percentage of total GDP composed of student loan debt per quarter was calculated and fitted to a logistic curve. Future quarterly values for total GDP and the percentage of total GDP composed by student loan debt per quarter were found through Long Short Term Models and Euler’s Method, respectively. Through the creation of a probability of recession index, the probability of recession per quarter was compared to the percentage of total GDP composed by student loan debt per quarter to construct an exponential regression model. Utilizing a primarily quantitative method of analysis, the percentage of total GDP composed by student loan debt per quarter was found to be strongly associated[p &lt; 1.26696* 10-8]with the probability of recession per quarter(p(R)), with the p(R) tending to peak as the percentage of total GDP composed of student loan debt per quarter strayed away from the carrying capacity of the logistic curve. Inputting the student loan debt forgiveness policies of potential congressional bills proposed by lawmakers found that eliminating 49.7 % and 36.7% of student loan debt would reduce the recession probabilities to be 1.73545*10-29% and 9.74474*10-25%, respectively.",TRUE,FALSE,Econometrics|Economics|Machine Learning|Recession|Student Loan Debt,2020-07-26T18:56:13.760176,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-26T18:55:38.936821,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/WNNWCO,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/citation/,exnjd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1887c285d25a000eef774c/,5f1887c285d25a000eef774c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exnjd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exnjd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exnjd

Evidence across two Irish cohorts, 2007 – 2018","Despite the growing body of literature on how digital technologies impact child well-being, previous research has provided little evidence on recent digital trends. This paper examines the patterns and effects of digital use on child socioemotional well-being across two cohorts of children grown up ten years apart during the ‘digital age’: the 1998 cohort (interviewed in 2007/08) and the 2008 cohort (interviewed in 2017/18). Multivariate linear regression models were conducted for these two cohorts from the Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) study, a multi-cohort longitudinal study with rich comparable data on a large sample of 9-year olds (N = 13,203). Results show that (i) in 2017/18 children were more active in digital devices and social media, while in 2007/2008 children spent more time watching TV and adopted less diversified forms of media engagement; (ii) spending more than 3 daily hours on TV/digital activities was associated with significant declines in child socioemotional well-being, while such effects were stronger in 2017/18 than in 2007/08; (iii) media engagement (but not other forms of digital engagement) was associated with moderate declines in socioemotional well-being, both in 2007/08 and in 2017/18; (iv) while children’s media and digital engagement differed by the child gender and socioeconomic background, none of these variables moderated the effects of digital use on children’s socioemotional well-being, neither in 2007/08 nor in 2017/18. Overall, the study reveals persistence, but also some important changes, in recent trends on children’s digital use and its impact on socioemotional well-being in Ireland.",TRUE,FALSE,Child socioemotional well-being|Cohort effects|Digital use|Ireland,2020-07-23T05:09:02.134167,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-23T05:08:50.400384,FALSE,NA,no,Growing Up in Ireland datasets are made available to researchers on a confidential and anonymised basis through the Irish Social Sciences Data Archive.,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/citation/,kf4tz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f18740d85d25a000bef7245/,5f18740d85d25a000bef7245,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf4tz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kf4tz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kf4tz

How Philanthrocapitalist Organizations Tackle Grand Challenges,"Can and should the superrich save the world? While this is a highly contested issue, attention is predominantly paid to individual philanthrocapitalists, such as Bill and Melinda Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Pierre Omidyar, George Soros, Elon Musk, or Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg and their visions. This paper conceives of such visions as raw material which is refined within philanthrocapitalist organizations. Traditionally, such organizations took the form of a tax-exempt foundation, a 501(c) organization. There seems to be a recent trend towards organizing as an LLC, thereby losing tax exemption. That an LLC is allowed to invest and earn money, does not fully explain this shift. Instead, the thesis is put forward that it is not all about money but that an LLC offers opportunities to solve problems such organizations typically face when tackling grand challenges: 1) making addressees use solutions (properly) and 2) scaling them. One solution (the Public Safety Assessment) from one organization (Arnold Ventures LLC) illustrates that philanthrocapitalist LLCs do not just execute their founder’s wills but translate visions into strategies to reach what money (alone) cannot buy and technology (alone) cannot operate – and what an LLC is needed for.",TRUE,FALSE,grand challenges|LLC|organization|philanthrocapitalism|philanthropy|re-specification|scalability|solutionism,2020-07-23T05:08:16.264419,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-23T05:07:51.577026,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/citation/,xh46a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f182f1a0596f601af79d454/,5f182f1a0596f601af79d454,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh46a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xh46a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xh46a

This paper also shows the precise timing in which NPIs have a reduced effect on deaths. The results indicate that confirmed cases are more positively correlated with NPIs than deaths, and NPIs show a strong positive correlation with deaths in the short run and a negative correlation in the long run.

The impact of the Dutch COVID-19 ‘intelligent lockdown’ on gendered work and family dynamics among parents","This study examines the impact of the Dutch ‘intelligent lockdown’ during the COVID-19 pandemic on work and family dynamics among parents. This ‘intelligent lockdown’ relied on a combination of restrictive measures and an emphasis on individual responsibility as a means of lessening the spread and health impact of the pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures had substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given gender inequality existent prior to the pandemic, the question arises to what extent the consequences of the lockdown varied for mothers and fathers. Using representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020, we explore changes in three areas: paid work, the division of care and household work, and quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Our linear probability and multinomial logistic models demonstrate that the way in which families were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. We find that gender inequality patterns in the division of paid work, care work, and housework continue to exist. Moreover, the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnified some inequalities while others were lessened. We find evidence of increased gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life, yet a decrease in gender inequality in the division of care and household tasks. During the lockdown, Dutch fathers reported doing more care and household tasks than before. The insights provided here offer key comparative references for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures on work and family dynamics, as well as quality of life as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 pandemic|division of care work|division of household work|gender inequality|gender roles|leisure|Netherlands|relationship dynamics|working from home|working time adaptation|work-life balance|work location,2020-07-21T13:39:05.826326,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-21T13:38:52.808672,FALSE,NA,no,The data will be publicly available in the coming weeks from the LISS data archive: www.lissdata.nl,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Mara A.
