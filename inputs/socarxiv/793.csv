But each of these claims relies upon the authorization status of the targeted user. Authorization is largely an incident of the virtual world proprietor's Terms of Service (ToS). Thus, the ToS is increasingly regarded as a license to access the proprietor's servers; violation of the ToS annuls authorization to access the servers. The result is that any misbehavior by users, in violation of the ToS, can be recast as a violation of copyright, or trespass, or technical circumvention laws, even if the undesired behavior has little bearing on the variety legal claim asserted.

On-line multiplayer role-playing games have become an important social and business feature of the Internet.  The virtual worlds that game players inhabit now encompass population counts and economic activity greater than that of many nations in the physical world.   The  activity of players participating in an on-line game community is closely tied to paratexts that may include magazines, websites, and even devices that lie outside the formal boundaries of the game, but which are intimately bound up in the transmission of knowledge and culture surrounding the game.  In this paper, I examine the legal structures that foster or inhibit particular gaming paratexts.  Such laws are in some senses extrinsic to the ""magic circle"" of the game, but these external rules are deployed as constraints to enforce the internal logic of the game.  Typically this occurs in cases where violation of the game's internal parameters would affect the owner's external marketing or business control.  Commercial game developers may use copyright and related anti-circumvention laws to enforce preferred readings of the game, largely by dominating the paratexts associated with their product.

While these automated tools greatly facilitate the retrieval and analysis of data for academic research, they may pose ethical problems for Internet researchers. Specifically, automated software bots place some load on servers being accessed, possibly in contradiction to the expected use of such servers, and possibly in violation of the legal prerogatives of web site owners. Determining how and when to access such web sites, and whether to seek the consent of web site owners for retrieval of publicly accessible data presents an apparent conflict between general principles of information policy and the emerging legal precedent regarding trespass to computers. This conflict may be characterized as pitting utilitarian considerations against deontological considerations in a fashion reminiscent of previous debates over informed consent in on-line research. In this paper, we examine both utilitarian and deontological characterizations of the ethical obligations of researchers employing automated data retrieval bots, and argue that the contrasts between the two approaches do not necessarily result in conflict. Instead, we argue that the tension within the relevant practices indicates the need for a ""meta-choice"" between utilitarian and deontological considerations. We further suggest certain factors that may differentiate such a ""metaethical"" choice in the context of automated data retrieval from the ""meta-ethical"" choice presented in previously identified contexts of human subjects research or of web browser technology design.

The components of the system fall into three categories: (1) the equitable remedies themselves, (2) equitable managerial devices, and (3) equitable constraints.  ese components interact subtly and pervasively. Together, they make the equitable remedies apt for compelling action (or inaction), especially when the action may be continuing or iterative and is not easily measured. The system of equitable remedies is a useful and integrated whole.

This argument offers some support for an emerging body of Supreme Court cases that have sharply distinguished between legal and equitable remedies—cases such as Great- West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson, eBay v. MercExchange, and Petrella v. MGM. Moreover, this argument helps explain why there has been so little merger between law and equity in remedies, even as merger has occurred in other aspects of American law.

Using ideas from cultural and organizational theory, I examine the interplay of individual
and congregation-level educational attainment on biblical literalism. Data on 387 congregations
and 100,009 worshippers (US Congregational Life Survey, 2001) are used to test
hypotheses. Results indicate that the effects of congregational education and individual
educational attainment are among the largest effects in models. This study is the first to
show that regardless of an individual's own education, affirmations of biblical literalism
are less likely when persons with higher education dominate a congregation. This finding
brings into relief the important role of social context in persons' belief in biblical literalism.
Additionally, congregational education amplifies the influence of individual education on
biblical literalism such that the gap in belief between college/non-college education individuals
widens in high education congregations. This finding suggests that high education
persons more deeply absorb the influence of a more educated congregational context.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:08.878592,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T17:40:40.547000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/citation/,ks5th,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hs5u3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/relationships/node/,hs5u3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578d149b9ad5a101fe953200/,578d149b9ad5a101fe953200,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ks5th/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ks5th/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ks5th

Risk and Quality Thresholds Predict the Locus of Innovation,"Where does innovation come from? This research models producer incentives to innovate with a focus on the role of audiences in constructing quality thresholds within markets. Market audiences create mechanisms for identifying the highest quality producers in a market. I highlight a key distinction between fixed quality thresholds (such as accreditations) and quality thresholds that respond to producer quality (such as rankings or best-of-breed awards). Producers evaluate how the inherently risky nature of innovation interacts with these thresholds. The model predicts conditions under which innovation emerges from the best producers in a market, from producers near the threshold in a market, from both, or from nowhere. Such predictions generalize and simplify several existing organizational theories of innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,agent based model|formal model|middle-status conformity|organizations|Preprint|rankings|ratings|simulation|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:05.063757,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T16:59:05.202000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/citation/,rcsjn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8rrj8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/relationships/node/,8rrj8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578d0ae36c613b01ec15ceb4/,578d0ae36c613b01ec15ceb4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcsjn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rcsjn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rcsjn

social influence directs the flow of information, and influence affects
object valuation. This paper proposes an integrated model of
decision-making for the adoption process. This model reveals a neglected
middle step between information and valuation: social influence affects
whether agents consider a particular object as relevant to the adoption
decision. I identify this attention-driving mechanism using data on traders
in an online foreign exchange platform. Features of the setting exclude the
possibility of information- or valuation-driven diffusion, but traders
still adopt one another’s trading behaviors, and they do so most for those
rare behaviors that lack external drivers of attention. I discuss the
importance of attention- driven diffusion for future work and the value of
an integrated decision model in delineating conditions under which existing
theories of influence apply.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:46.855756,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-18T16:57:29.179000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/citation/,w8a4t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z4sjf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/relationships/node/,z4sjf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578d0a7b594d9001f5816432/,578d0a7b594d9001f5816432,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8a4t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8a4t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8a4t
