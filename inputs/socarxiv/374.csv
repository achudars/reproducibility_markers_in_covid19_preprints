It also aimed at showing that having no exposure to English language culture alongside learning the English language itself will affect learners' understanding and production of the language. In this light, the study attempts to answer the following questions: to what extent is the culture of the English language present in the lessons of English language that are introduced to secondary school students? What cultural background do secondary school students have about the English language? And if they do have any cultural background, what is the source of that background and whether culture teaching enhances EFL learners' socio-cultural competence? We hypothesised that teaching culture to Algerian EFL learners will increase their sociocultural competence and improve their understanding of the language. This hypothesis was tested through conducting a quasi-experimental study with a group of eighteen students from Habba Abd El-Madjid Secondary School in El-Meghaier, El-Oued (Algeria) The final results revealed a remarkable improvement among the majority of students concerning their sociocultural competence and their perception and understanding of authentic English language.

However, phrasal verbs in English language teaching as a second/foreign language is almost non-existent. That is, English as a second language (ESL)/English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching environments, in the Arab world, and specifically in Iraq, hardly teach the meaning of phrasal verbs to students, and neglect teaching the correct ways of using them, despite the fact that they are an essential part of daily native English communication. Therefore, and due to the vitality of phrasal verbs to native speakers of English, ESL/EFL students should be taught and educated to be capable of understanding and using phrasal verbs when interacting in English because knowledge of phrasal verbs would normally lead to better English language proficiency and more native-like communication. Nonetheless, phrasal verbs are not easy, and students often find them difficult, because phrasal verbs carry a specific meaning which is not inferable from the meaning of its composing words inseparable form as well as other reasons which have been explained within this paper.  Hence, this paper points to the necessity of including phrasal verbs in English language teaching. Through implementing a qualitative approach, the aim, within this paper, is to identify and list causes of difficulty that learners of the English language may face when it comes to knowledge of English phrasal verbs, with regard to the spontaneous and fluent use of phrasal verbs by native English speakers.

Teachers initiate learners to the whole learning process, and their feedback constitutes the significant step forward that triggers learners towards enunciating a language. As an illustration, Swain (1985, 2000) uses empirical evidence to show the importance of teacherâ€™s feedback during the production of speaking. Relatable to feedback during oral activity are issues that highlight teachersâ€™ pronunciation, fluency, body language, facial expressions, and error correction during the production phase. To identify these areas, the current article used studentsâ€™ questionnaires. The general aim is to gauge learnersâ€™ perceptions, practices and problems. Results highlight the pivotal teachersâ€™ role in the whole process. Therefore, the specific aim of this study is to investigate the role of teachersâ€™ feedback during speaking activities in Moroccan classes. Results show that interaction enhancement and negotiation density do indeed establish the interconnection between accuracy and fluency. Some speech strategists and specialists have already demonstrated how instruction and the way teachers provide feedback do play a major role in learnersâ€™ speaking skills including the need for a contrary evidence.",TRUE,FALSE,feedback|learnersâ€™ perceptions|Moroccan classes|speaking activity|teachersâ€™ role,2019-10-13T12:31:01.263439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-13T12:30:44.661296,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/citation/,k8g2t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da01c8cf6b03e000f1ed185/,5da01c8cf6b03e000f1ed185,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8g2t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k8g2t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.24,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k8g2t

It illustrated if there is an effect of learning culture on English language competence to the students of Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University . The studyÊ¼s methodology included a questionnaire administered to 70 undergraduate female students in the English department at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. Results show that Saudi students recognized that culture and language are related to each other and the learning process cannot be fully realized without consideration of both aspects. Moreover, the study found that learning the English language with its corresponding cultural elements will enhance the speed and enjoyment of Saudi studentsÊ¼ learning process. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that learning a foreign language not only involves studying syntactic structures or learning new vocabularies, but also should incorporate some cultural elements. From Saudi students' point of view, the only difficulty that might face them is the differences between Arabic and English cultures. Finally, this study recommends that further research can investigate the effect of culture on learning from the teachers' point of view",TRUE,FALSE,English foreign language (EFL)|incorporation|intercultural communication|Language integrating|Saudi students,2019-10-11T16:54:23.870950,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:53:49.726844,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/citation/,hrxdt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da01b2ca7bc73000dec7874/,5da01b2ca7bc73000dec7874,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrxdt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hrxdt/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.23,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hrxdt

The shortness of linguistic data in texts of the kind makes it challenging for conventional stylometric authorship methods to assign disputed texts to their real authors. As thus, this study proposes a new stylometric authorship system based on morphological patterns and letter mapping properties. The assumption is that these carry unique and distinctive stylistic features that can be usefully used to recognize possible authors of disputed texts. The study is based on a corpus of 259 flash fiction stories written in Arabic. Cluster analysis was for grouping documents that have shared linguistic features together. Results indicate that all texts were successfully matched with their real authors. It can be concluded that morphological information can be usefully used for improving the performance of authorship attribution and detection in Arabic texts due to the unique stylistic features of the affixation processes in Arabic. Controversial texts in Arabic can thus be assigned to their authors based on detecting stable morphological patterns with reliable authorship performance.",TRUE,FALSE,authorship attribution|flash fiction|letter mapping|morphological patterns|stylometry,2019-10-11T16:54:03.514373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:53:08.958264,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/citation/,bqwem,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da019dfa7bc73000dec7718/,5da019dfa7bc73000dec7718,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqwem/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bqwem/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bqwem
