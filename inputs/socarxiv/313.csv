Identifying typologies through cluster analysis, thus disregarding individual sequences’ peculiarities, is the aim of most applications. However, a substantive interpretation of such typology can be questionable when clusters include sequences deviating from the others. We propose an integrated approach to identify such sequences, distinguishing between sequences presenting structural peculiarities and randomly deviating sequences. We monitor the quality of partitions with respect to the amount and type of deviation in each cluster relying on novel graphical tools allowing to properly visualize and closely inspect the structure of deviating sequences. We demonstrate that the identification of deviating sequences provides relevant insights also when clusters are used as dependent or independent variables in an explanatory framework, for example in combination with multinomial logistic regression analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,cluster analysis|index plot|sequence analysis|validation|visualization,2019-09-27T00:17:24.724350,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-26T15:06:16.949394,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/citation/,v7mj8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8a323cb3c37400199c100f/,5d8a323cb3c37400199c100f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v7mj8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v7mj8,NA

However, societal responses – from service providers, and friends and family – to help seeker’s disclosures of non-physical abuse are indicative of much narrower understandings. This thesis draws on qualitative data derived from semi-structured interviews with nine survivors of non-physical abuse to examine how responses to help seeking efforts influence stay/leave decision-making. Constructivist  grounded theory was used in the analysis of responses from which two categories emerged – invalidating and validating.  Invalidating responses inhibited further help seeking and prolonged exposure to abuse. Validating responses prompted efforts to alleviate or leave abuse. Drawing on the thesis findings, the discussion and analysis centre on better understanding the social foundations of decision-making and responses. These include: the reasons responses are so influential in the decision-making process, why responses are often incongruent with current policy and practice guidelines, conceptions of abuse in popular discourse, and the impact of social norms and popular discourse on non-help seeking behaviours. Following from this, some of the measures that might be employed to change societal responses to intimate partner abuse are discussed. The current study found that responses to participant’s help seeking efforts were influential in their decisions to stay in, or leave the relationship. The findings indicate that responses to help-seeking efforts are derived from public perceptions of, and attitudes to, intimate partner abuse. Poor understandings can result in poor responses, which can ultimately put the victim at risk. The current societal focus on physical manifestations of abuse belies the complexity of the problem and is detrimental to efforts to address intimate partner abuse. Improved awareness and acknowledgment of the impact of non-physical intimate partner abuse is therefore critical to domestic violence reduction and intervention.",TRUE,FALSE,domestic abuse|help-seeking|intimate partner abuse|non-physical abuse,2019-09-24T11:06:45.300550,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-24T11:06:31.393401,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/citation/,ctr7h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d898ff7b3c374001a9b2a0f/,5d898ff7b3c374001a9b2a0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ctr7h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ctr7h,NA

Using event history analysis methods, I document the limited spread of expulsion among over 500 polities in the western Holy Roman Empire, 1385-1520 CE. Temporal and spatial trends indicate that expulsions in politically and economically powerful cities spurred expulsions generally but suppressed them nearby.

We re-examine this result controlling for the concurrent adoption of the Prospectus Directive (PD), which mandated increased IPO prospectus disclosures, and the enforcement of these disclosures in the member states of the European Union (EU). First, we find that there is a significant data error in Hong et al.’s study that renders their reported results unreliable: approximately 30% of the treatment firms this study categorizes as mandatory IFRS adoptions are not, in fact, subject to a mandate to report in IFRS. These are firms admitted to trading on “exchange-regulated” markets in the EU that do not require IFRS. We use hand-collected prospectus data to identify the correct treatment sample. Our analysis shows that, for affected firms, there is a statistically significant decrease in IPO underpricing associated with adoption of the PD for firms based in countries that also concurrently enhanced accounting enforcement (see Christensen, Hail, and Leuz 2013), but there is no association between mandatory IFRS adoption and IPO underpricing. We also examine voluntary IFRS adoptions by firms admitted to trading on exchange-regulated markets after 2005. Overall we find no evidence that mandatory IFRS adoption resulted in very large economic gains for IPO firms.

The social stratification of food consumption profiles in Italy, 1997-2016","Using data from the Multiporpose Survey of Daily Life by ISTAT, this paper analyses the profiling and social stratification of food consumption among Italian adults from 1997 to 2016. We first apply Latent Class Analysis on a set of central food categories of the Mediterranean diet to document the existence of six consumption clusters, (herbivore, carnivore, hedonist, enhanced Mediterranean, paucivore, omnivore) and their relative size over time. Second, we employ fractional response models to illustrate how gender and education are associated with each of the identified clusters. Finally, we use variance-weighted least square regressions to document the evolution of gender and education gradients over time.
Results point to an increase in the relative size of the herbivores and omnivores, a substantial stability of the hedonists and paucivores, and a decline of the carnivores and enhanced Mediterraneans. Moreover, our findings highlight a substantial social stratification of food profiles and show that, within a broad picture of persistence, gender and education became more important in affecting the propensity of adopting certain profiles. Women and upper educated individuals are more likely to belong to clusters characterised by daily fruit and vegetable consumption. Moreover, women are also less likely to belong to clusters defined by the presence of alcoholics and soft drinks. In addition, the gap between upper and lower educated individuals in the probability of belonging to the omnivore profile, and the gap between women and men in the probability of belonging to the herbivore and hedonist profiles have increased over time.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural stratification|eating patterns|food consumption|health stratification|latent class analysis|omnivore-univore,2019-09-24T12:14:24.188731,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-24T11:08:04.021130,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Filippo Oncini &amp; Moris Triventi,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/citation/,32x6m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d88e06f53713d00191c03f6/,5d88e06f53713d00191c03f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/32x6m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/32x6m,NA

Research on face-to-face service work has shown that these workers are expected to display certain emotions in the course of their work, a phenomenon known as emotional labor. However, little is known about emotional communication among online customer service workers. We explored emotional labor in an online context by examining the degree of emotional presence in mediated service interactions and its relationship with workers’ acting strategies (i.e., surface acting, deep acting). Further, we examined if emotional presence and acting strategies predict job satisfaction as well as burnout. Data collected from 130 online customer service workers indicated that they perceive the highest emotional presence in phone conversations, followed by email and chat. Although there was little relationship between emotional presence and acting strategies, those who engage in surface acting are less satisfied with their job and more likely to experience burnout. In addition, those who feel a higher degree of emotional presence over the phone tend to experience higher job satisfaction and less burnout.

While email continues to dominate much workplace interaction, the use of instant messaging (IM) continues to grow (Garrett &amp; Danziger, 2007), prompting scholars to look at how it is used in a variety of organizational contexts. In this chapter, I first give a background on the research into IM use in organizations. I will then look at IM as a form of conversation, and discuss why adopting a language-based approach to the study of IM is useful for communication professionals. I illustrate this discussion with an examination of one particular phenomenon, utterance chunking, in task-based IM interactions. Finally I will conclude by discussing the implications of this research for business discourse and make some suggestions for future research in this area.",TRUE,FALSE,business discourse|communication studies|computer-mediated communication|conversation analysis|dyadic interaction|instant messaging|language &amp; social interaction|linguistics,2019-09-21T23:50:02.239696,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-21T23:49:44.047506,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e12|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Interpersonal and Small Group Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/citation/,nu7vt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8r7p6/,8r7p6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d86516d51eeee0018bb69df/,5d86516d51eeee0018bb69df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu7vt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nu7vt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nu7vt,https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137405579

This pattern of waning effects could well be the result of selective attrition, since those of modest social origins who make a given transition may have unobserved characteristics, such as cognitive or noncognitive skills, that help them make the next transition, while better off individuals may be less steeply selected on these characteristics. I study a sample of American 10th graders from 1980 to assess how much the pattern of waning effects is due to selective attrition along academic and noncognitive skills for this cohort. I find that controlling for academic skills makes the effect of socioeconomic status more stable across transitions, but controlling for noncognitive skills does not. Socioeconomic advantage does not decline uniformly across transitions, and it appears most pronounced at the transition into college. These results do not support a claim that late transitions are egalitarian.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-21T23:49:03.446958,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-21T23:48:34.787660,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",N/A,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/citation/,bxe4t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d86425b51eeee0017bdaace/,5d86425b51eeee0017bdaace,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bxe4t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bxe4t,NA

Political science also shows signs of reworking itself in response to these crises. Sociology sits on the sidelines. There have not been the same reliability or ethical scandals, at least not in the limelight, nor has there been strong disciplinary moves toward open science. This paper therefore investigates sociology as a discipline looking at current practices, definitions of sociology, positions of sociological associations and a brief consideration of the arguments of three highly influential sociologists: Weber, Merton and Habermas. Based on this disciplinary review, I suggest that sociology is no different from its neighboring disciplines in terms of reliability or ethical dilemmas. Therefore, sociology should adopt open science practices immediately. Weber, Merton and Habermas – three very different social thinkers epistemologically – offer strong arguments that favor what we know as “open science” today. Open science promotes ethics and reliability, reduces fraud and ultimately increases the value of sociology for policymakers and the public. The paper concludes with some basic steps individual researchers can take to move sociology toward open science.",TRUE,FALSE,Freier Zugang|Habermas|Merton|Offene Wissenschaft|Open Access|Open Science|P-Hacking|Publication Bias|Reproducibility Crisis|Reproduzierbarkeitskrise|Science Community|Transparency|Transparenz|Weber|wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft,2019-09-21T14:59:23.340152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-21T14:58:56.601574,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/citation/,d37be,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4rf83/,4rf83,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d854f26b3103d0017505fb1/,5d854f26b3103d0017505fb1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d37be/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d37be/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d37be,NA
