It addresses recent calls to include actions and interventions which restrict citizenship in the context of illegalized migration within critical citizenship studies literature. Studying the state violence upholding and spatializing normative citizenship allows for a deeper understanding of citizenship’s implication in the European border regime, and raises questions on the concept’s continued application to theorizations of migrants’ political movements and spatial manifestations. The paper proposes anti-citizen politics as an alternative before arguing that the presence of this politics within the city’s squats and jungles, more than the physical occupations as such, is what the French state seeks to eradicate through acts of domicide. Working from empirical examples, the article describes a ‘carrot-and-stick’ domicide currently at work in Calais where the eviction and destruction of autonomous forms of migrant inhabitance is combined with a simultaneous offer of state managed accommodation. These tactics operate together to drive migrants out of the city of Calais, away from the UK border, and ultimately into a determination of their detain/deport-ability via citizenship’s scrutiny.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-citizenship|Calais|domicide|France|spatial inhabitance/segregation|technologies of citizenship,2019-09-04T02:46:04.963783,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:45:34.717520,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/citation/,vuw72,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ce458536cf5001a8ab07b/,5d6ce458536cf5001a8ab07b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vuw72/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vuw72,https://doi.org/10.1080/13621025.2019.1634422

New evidence on age cleavages in Europe since the 1980s,"This paper asks how strong the evidence is for a large and growing age cleavage in European politics, using new estimates of the ideological positions of different age groups in 27 European countries across four issue domains from 1981-2016, together with age-period-cohort analysis and an examination of voting patterns by age. The young turn out to be much more socially liberal than the old in most countries, but also more opposed to taxation and government spending. Age divides are generally no larger now than they were thirty years ago, are explained primarily by cohort replacement effects, and are likely to fall in the near future. Nonetheless, age divides in voting are large and in some places actually increasing.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there was indeed an influx of people from regions north of the Black Sea or further east in the fourth century CE, but there is no indication of a large-scale migration from central Asia. It is possible that the climatic downturn and increased aridity in the 430s to 450s disrupted both the economic organisation of the incomers and that of the local Romanised population, requiring both to adopt new subsistence strategies.

A question of great theoretical and practical importance is how successful social institutions get established and spread across groups and societies. Here, using institutionalized punishment in small-scale societies as an example, we contrast two prominent mechanisms - selective imitation and self-interested design - with respect to their ability to converge to cooperative social institutions. While selective imitation has received a great deal of attention in studies of social and cultural evolution, the theoretical toolbox for studying self-interested design is limited. Recently Perry et al. (2018) expanded this toolbox by introducing a novel approach, which they called foresight, generalizing standard myopic best response for the case of individuals with a bounded ability to anticipate actions of their group-mates and care about future payoffs. Here we apply this approach to two general types of collective action – “us vs. nature” and “us vs. them” games. Our results show that foresight increases leaders’ willingness to punish free-riders. This, in turn, leads to increased production and the emergence of an effective institution for collective action. We also observed that largely similar outcomes can be achieved by selective imitation, as argued earlier. Foresight and selective imitation can interact synergistically leading to a faster convergence to an equilibrium. Our approach is applicable to many other types of social

Though cultural explanations of social phenomena fell out of favor for a time (for a variety of various political and intellectual  reasons) they have returned to a place of prominence in the discipline. Despite this “cultural  renaissance,” however, wide variation in scholars’ use of the term has made it difficult for  non-specialists to understand what role it might play in their research. Moreover, some of these different uses even seem to be logically contradictory, with a minority of scholars regarding culture as defining the ends of action and a majority regarding it as comprising a means for action.The objective of this paper, is to advocate for a theory-building strategy that has yielded -- and I believe will continue to yield -- advances in cultural theory.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|theory of action,2019-08-30T14:40:23.887471,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-30T14:40:08.086036,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/citation/,9mwfc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d692f5b6f41fc001c2f8ed5/,5d692f5b6f41fc001c2f8ed5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mwfc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9mwfc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9mwfc,NA
