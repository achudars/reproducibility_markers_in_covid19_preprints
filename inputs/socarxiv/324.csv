It has been called an epidemic and a public health crisis. In May of 2019, a diverse group of researchers participated in a workshop at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This workshop was sponsored by the Center for the Dynamics of Social Complexity (DySoC) and the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS). The objectives of this workshop were to review the existing approaches on the mathematics and modeling of gun violence, identify and prioritize areas in the field that require further research, develop cross-disciplinary collaborations to gain new perspectives, and suggest research and data collection that could assist evidence-based policy recommendations.

The 2018 National Academies of Science Report on Envisioning the Data Science Discipline recommends that “The data science community should adopt a code of ethics”, but due to its recency and to the diversity of paths into data science as a discipline, there is no real “community” that can do or organize this adoption. To support this recommendation, this white paper is an effort to document concordance across professional association practice standards, intended to support the ethical practice of data science by appealing to the consensus of these professional organizations on what constitutes ethical practice. The American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) recently revised their professional ethical practice standards in 2018. Both sets of guidance represent the perspectives of experienced professionals in their respective domains, but both organizations explicitly state that the guidelines apply to – should be utilized by – all who employ the domain in their work, irrespective of job title or training/professional preparation. Given that both statistics and
computing are essential foundations for data science, their ethical guidance should therefore be a starting point for the community as it contemplates what “ethical data science” looks like.
The work of analyzing concordance in ethical guidance begins with a qualitative examination of the overlap (similarly worded principles), alignment (thematically similar principles), and gaps (dissimilar principles) that exist between existing sets of standards. To that end, the ethical practice guidance has been thematically analyzed from the standards outlined by the ASA, ACM, the International Statistics Institute, Royal Statistical Society, and the Ethics in Action guidance drafted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. This synthesis is intended to capture similarities and differences in relevant practical guidelines, integrating professional organizational perspectives on what constitutes ethical practice in data science to support and strengthen the domain. Ultimately, guidelines for ethical data science that reflect the concordance of cognate disciplines can ensure coherent integration of the features of ethical practice into training of data scientists - for both the practitioner and those who use data science, or its outputs, in their work.",TRUE,FALSE,applied ethics|data science|ethical computing|ethical practice|statistics and data science,2020-02-20T14:20:51.025511,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-20T14:20:25.809943,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/citation/,p7rj2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4d6b9ab8c2e5016a4c6c54/,5e4d6b9ab8c2e5016a4c6c54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7rj2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p7rj2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p7rj2,NA

We review the known Pleistocene archaeology and paleoclimatic setting of this region and provide a geoarchaeological framework for contextualizing preliminary survey results of the PALAEOSILKROAD project’s first three seasons of fieldwork. We discuss some systematic biases in three geomorphic and sedimentary archives: karst, loess, and spring deposits, specifying ways in which these biases might determine the kinds of data that are extractable by systematic survey. In particular, we caution about the possibility of future systematic biases in chronology that could come about as a result of the type of geomorphic context in which the sites are recovered.

In modern, online markets, it is increasingly common for providers of a good to also act as consumers, and vice versa. We argue that in such mixed-role markets, reputation systems serve a second important function: They allow providers who lend out their possessions (such as their house, car or tools) to earn reputational credits that can be spent in future exchanges when in their role as consumer, especially when they do not receive a monetary compensation. In an experiment that introduces a new game, “the Lending Game”, we show that, consistent with our argument, information on past lending leads subjects to lend to those who have themselves lent before, increasing overall lending.

We advance the understanding of the inequality in early life outcomes by analyzing whether prenatal stress affects prematurity and low birth weight and how this effect varies by parental socio-economic status. To address the endogeneity of prenatal stress and pregnancy outcomes we use a natural experiment and consider the 2004 Madrid train bombings as an exogenous source of stress. Compared to other natural experiments used in prior research, our design has higher credibility and enable us to exclude biases due to various confounders. We analyze administrative data referring to the whole population of newborns in Spain and use a difference-in-differences design with a synthetic control approach. We find that children exposed to the Madrid bombing had a higher risk of prematurity and low birth weight, and that this detrimental effect is concentrated among low-SES offspring.

In this study, we explore self-reported dependency and its concordance with the outcomes of a clinical screening tool designed to indicate DSM-V drug dependence in criminal justice populations. We find that not all offenders who self-report their dependency are clinically assessed as dependent. Similarly, not all those who are clinically assessed as dependent identify as such.

Recent studies find that observed trends and International Energy Agency (IEA) projections of global CO2 emissions have diverged from emission scenario outlooks widely employed in climate research. Here, we quantify the bases for this divergence, focusing on Kaya Identity factors: population, per-capita GDP, energy intensity (energy consumption/GDP), and carbon intensity (CO2 emissions/energy consumption). We compare 2005-2017 observations and IEA projections to 2040 of these variables, to “baseline” scenario projections from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in the upcoming Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We find that the historical divergence of observed CO2 emissions from baseline scenario projections can be explained largely by slower-than-projected per-capita GDP growth—predating the COVID-19 crisis. We also find carbon intensity divergence from baselines in IEA’s projections to 2040. IEA projects less coal energy expansion than the baseline scenarios, with divergence expected to continue to 2100. Future economic growth is uncertain, but we show that past divergence from observations makes it unlikely that per-capita GDP growth will catch up to baselines before mid-century. Some experts hypothesize high enough economic growth rates to allow per-capita GDP growth to catch up to or exceed baseline scenarios by 2100. However, we argue that this magnitude of catch-up may be unlikely, in light of: headwinds such as aging and debt, the likelihood of unanticipated economic crises, the fact that past economic forecasts have tended to over-project, the aftermath of the current pandemic, and economic impacts of climate change unaccounted-for in the baseline scenarios.

These differences suggest that independent directors could play a unique role on private firm boards. This paper explores the dynamics of VC-backed startup boards using novel data on director entry, exit, and characteristics. We document new facts about board composition, allocation of control, and dynamics, and examine the roles of independent directors. At formation, a typical board is entrepreneur-controlled. Independent directors join the median board after the second financing, when board control becomes shared, with independent directors holding the tie-breaking vote between entrepreneurs and VCs. At later stages, control switches to VCs and independent director characteristics change. These patterns are consistent with independent directors playing both a mediating and advising role over the startup life cycle, and thus representing another potential source of value-add to startup performance.",TRUE,FALSE,board of directors|corporate governance|entrepreneurship|independent directors|startups|venture capital,2020-02-18T19:40:01.821729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-18T19:39:36.348076,FALSE,NA,no,See the Internet Appendix for details on the data construction.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/citation/,t96yq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c63pu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/relationships/node/,c63pu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4b0cedb8c2e5000f4c4d48/,5e4b0cedb8c2e5000f4c4d48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t96yq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t96yq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t96yq,NA

We use basil, heather, and orchids as experimental objects in two stated-choice experiments (a lab-in-the-field experiment and an online experiment) conducted in Germany. In both experiments, we find strong evidence that consumers prefer plants protected by beneficial insects. Moreover, we find that message framing affects consumers’ willingness to pay, where gain framing produces greater overall willingness to pay. To check for the robustness of our results, we implemented instruments to mitigate concerns for social desirability and hypothetical bias, finding that our results are robust in terms of our key findings. This is the first comprehensive experimental study specifically on consumer’s willingness to pay for plants protected by beneficial insects. Our findings are valuable for practitioners, as the use of beneficial insects in greenhouse production is already rather common. Following our results, this information could be successfully used for marketing purposes.",TRUE,FALSE,Biological control|framing experiments|hypothetical bias|replication study|social desirability|willingness to pay,2020-02-18T14:48:44.423548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-18T14:48:33.869036,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,Mira Lehberger,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/citation/,5zc62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4a88713e86a8021a6e4fb1/,5e4a88713e86a8021a6e4fb1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zc62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zc62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5zc62,NA
