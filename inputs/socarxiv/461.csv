The introduction of information and communication technologies in educational and research processes is a compulsory requirement to implement the concept of modernization in Russian education. Recently, interest in English as a means of international communication has increased significantly, it has already been recognized as the language of professional communication in various fields of activity. The relevance of this work is undoubted. Modern higher school teachers are constantly looking for more effective approaches in training English and in the process of creating an electronic educational environment that would allow students access to various sources of information and help satisfy the interests of the modern student. The goal of the research is to increase the efficiency of training English in the system of higher professional education through the development and use of educational software products that apply modern information technology. Methods to achieve this goal include the method of using computer technology, methods of network planning and project management. The research showed that the organization of the information-instrumental educational environment uses a student centered approach, the development of an electronic educational and methodological complex (EEMC) is a search for an algorithm, most adapted to the student's cognitive needs, and EEMC in English creates the best conditions for the principle of interactivity.

It requires teachers to employ suitable approaches and methodologies to ensure the effectiveness of the lesson. This serves as the main purpose of this study which is to discover the approaches employed by literature teachers. In addition, three significant dimensions will also be scrutinised which are locality, literature training and teaching experience. Utilizing questionnaire as the research instrument, this study involved 271 teachers as the respondents. Comparisons pertaining to the approaches employed based on locality, training and teaching experience were shown in the findings. To note, the majority of the respondents were found to be in favor of using simple terminologies as the most preferred approach. Meanwhile, the least favored approach was eliciting information from students. In addition, out of the three main variables, only teaching experience was found to show no significant difference. To summarise, locality, training and teaching experience may have significantly impacted teachers in selecting the approaches to be employed in a literature lesson.

The problem of the present study is shown clearly in the answers of Iraqi students of Master of Arts in the College of Education for Women University of Baghdad. In spite of all the previous years of studying English language, some still have the problem of fossilized active and passive simple present tense. The present study aims at shedding light on the reasons behind the Iraqi students’ problem. An error analysis is applied to critically examine the students’ answers in their final course exam of two courses namely; pragmatics and discourse analysis. Depending on Selinker’s model (1972) of error analysis, students errors are all traced back to the language transfer of their native language. Among the results of analysis the researchers have arrived at a suitable solution for the current problem embodied by Sharwood’s Consciousness-Raising Approach (1981).

Specifically, the study aims at answering two research questions: Why Saudi do parents chose to speak English to their child/children? And What are the effects of mostly speaking English on the children and their home language: Arabic? A total of ten participating parents took part in this research study where semi structured interviews were utilised to gather the primary data. Thematic analysis of the data revealed three main emerging themes and six subthemes. The findings from the data analysis revealed that Saudi parents speak English with their children so as to allow them the opportunity to be bilingual and linguistically (English – L2) proficient as well as the fact that those parents were pleased to see their children speak English with a British accent. Also, the analysis revealed that that children of Saudi parents speaking English only has led to the weakening and loss of their Arabic L1 language.

Controlled studies of mice and non-human primates indicate Zika affects fecundity, raising concerns about miscarriage in human populations. In regions of Brazil, Zika risk peaked months before residents learned about the epidemic and its relation to congenital anomalies. This spatiotemporal variation supports analysis of both biological effects of Zika infection on fertility and the effects of learning about Zika risk on reproductive behavior. Causal inference techniques used with vital statistics indicate that the epidemic caused reductions of approximately one-quarter in birth cohort size 18 months after Zika infection risk peaked, but 10 months after public health messages advocated childbearing delay. The evidence is consistent with small, but not statistically detectable, biological reductions in fecundity, as well as large strategic changes in reproductive behavior to temporally align childbearing with reduced risk to infant health. The behavioral effects are larger for more educated and older women, which may reflect facilitated access to information and to family planning services within high-risk, mosquito-infested urban locations, as well as perceptions about the opportunity costs of risks to pregnancy and infant survival.",TRUE,FALSE,avoidance|Brazil|fecundity|fertility|tempo effects|Zika,2019-04-10T12:07:48.291618,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-10T12:07:23.360275,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/citation/,fu8bp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca90996641d100018bf55a3/,5ca90996641d100018bf55a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fu8bp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fu8bp

We argue that ABMs can be extremely helpful to assess models when the phenomena under study is complex. As an example, we create an ABM to evaluate the estimation of selection and influence effects by SIENA, a stochastic actor-oriented model proposed by Tom A. B. Snijders and colleagues. It is a prominent network analysis method that has gained popularity during the last 10 years and been applied to estimate selection and influence for a broad range of behaviors and traits such as substance use, delinquency, violence, health, and educational attainment. However, we know little about the conditions for which this method is reliable or the particular biases it might have. The results from our analysis show that selection and influence are estimated by SIENA asymmetrically, and that with very simple assumptions, we can generate data where selection estimates are highly sensitive to mis-specification, suggesting caution when interpreting SIENA analyses.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based models|influence effects|networks|selection|SIENA|simulated data|simulation|stochastic actor–based model,2019-04-05T20:44:49.175315,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T20:44:06.997965,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,SAGE,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/citation/,98fp4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca79620df977b0018f2ffae/,5ca79620df977b0018f2ffae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/98fp4/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124119826147,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/98fp4

Yet the chasm between them is a similarly enduring characteristic of the field of education studies. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the practice brief as an overlooked and grossly underutilized genre of scholarly writing in the field of higher education—in particular the field of community college studies—as one way to more intentionally address the research-practice gap. Crafted, as it so happens, as a practice brief, this paper posits a working definition, provides an overview of the genre in relation to other types of scholarly papers and other fields of study, and enumerates key characteristics of practice briefs to guide authors and peer reviewers. We discuss how practice briefs can be situated within a largely missing form of educational praxis and scholarship such as evidence-based practice (EBP). Lastly, we call on the higher education research community to include this genre in very specific terms within calls for journal submissions, in graduate programs, and in collaboration with practitioner partners.",TRUE,FALSE,academic publishing|community colleges|evidence based practice|practice brief|research practice gap,2019-04-05T20:44:10.833859,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T20:42:39.154147,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5b|Education|Community College Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/citation/,4nmbv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5w793/,5w793,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca79190df977b0019f2ebd2/,5ca79190df977b0019f2ebd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4nmbv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4nmbv

Little is understood about natural disasters which has implications in planning humanitarian response. We examined the magnitude and direction of the association between exposure to natural disasters and physical, emotional, and sexual violence against children, and assessed the quality of the evidence. 

Methods: We searched 15 health and social science databases from first record until May 16, 2018. Publications describing all types of quantitative study design were eligible for inclusion. We presented study characteristics and quality in a narrative form and generated pooled estimates using a three-level random effects model. We evaluated Cochrane’s Q with p-values below 0.10 and radial plots to assess heterogeneity. Planned subgroup analyses explored differential results by violence form, study design, and analysis method.

Results: 11 publications met inclusion criteria. The majority were cross-sectional studies examining physical or sexual violence in the United States. We found no evidence of a consistent association or directional influence between natural disasters and violence against children. Pooled estimates for combined outcomes had substantial heterogeneity [categorical outcomes: Q (df = 44) = 205.43, p &lt; 0.001 and continuous outcomes: Q (df = 4) = 68.63, p &lt; 0.001]. Subgroups without evidence of heterogeneity had confidence intervals that included a possible null effect. Our findings were mainly limited by inconsistencies in operational definitions of violence, a lack of representative sampling, and unclear establishment of temporal order between natural disaster exposure and violence outcomes. 

Conclusions: Based on the available evidence, we cannot confidently conclude that natural disasters increase the level or severity of violence against children above non-disaster settings, however heterogeneity and study quality hamper our ability to draw firm conclusions. More nuanced and rigorous research is needed to inform practice and policy as natural disasters increasingly affect human populations.",TRUE,FALSE,Child|Child protection|Emergency|Humanitarian crisis|Natural disaster|Violence,2019-04-05T15:36:07.299503,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T15:35:41.750841,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/citation/,bhu3w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca76c1bdf977b0019f2d278/,5ca76c1bdf977b0019f2d278,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bhu3w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bhu3w
