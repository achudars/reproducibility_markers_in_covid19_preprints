And since immemorial times it has been controversial and a source of harsh debates. Throughout the last decades, many changes have been introduced in this field and many practices, until then only taking place without public knowledge, were progressively revealed and regulated.
This paper aims, firstly, at clarifying the terminology and concepts usually used in the euthanasia debate and presenting, in a lucid way, the arguments that civic movements and authors resort to when defending or criticising the liberalisation of euthanasia. Secondly, it describes the legal and social situation regarding euthanasia in several countries, where cases and legislation have demanded greater awareness from society. Thirdly, it attempts to compare the different national situations previously analysed. Finally, it discusses ways of improving the present situation and finding better solutions for the regulation of euthanasia.
In such a debate, where moral, ethic and religious arguments and beliefs are called upon, it is crucial not to lose sight of the foundations of our culture(s) and society(ies). Therefore, this paper, although concentrating on the legal aspects of this debate, tries to take into account of some non-legal aspects which are also relevant and without which it is not possible to thoroughly discuss this issue. Ultimately, this paper does not attempt to portray a neutral position, sinc legal scholars should not necessarily limit themselves to technical and cold analysis of legal provisions.",TRUE,FALSE,euthanasia|non-voluntary euthanasia|right to die|voluntary euthanasia,2018-10-16T17:41:22.357943,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:40:49.109148,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2d|Law|Medical Jurisprudence|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/citation/,fd896,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dw4j7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/relationships/node/,dw4j7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5cc808811c1001855489c/,5bc5cc808811c1001855489c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fd896/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fd896/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fd896,NA

The Europeanization of Media Discourses about Euroscepticism across Six Countries,"This study compares the media discourses about Euroscepticism in 2014 across six countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark). We assess the extent to which the mass media’s reporting of Euroscepticism indicates the Europeanization of public spheres. Using a mixed-methods approach combining LDA topic modeling and qualitative coding, we find that approximately 70 per cent of print articles mentioning ‘Euroscepticism’ or ‘Eurosceptic’ are framed in a non-domestic (i.e. European) context. In five of the six cases studied, articles exhibiting a European context are strikingly similar in content, with the British case as the exception. However, coverage of British Euroscepticism drives Europeanization in other Member States. Bivariate logistic regressions further reveal three macro-level structural variables that significantly correlate with a Europeanized media discourse: newspaper type (tabloid or broadsheet), presence of a strong Eurosceptic party, and relationship to the EU budget (net contributor or receiver of EU funds).",TRUE,FALSE,Comparative Politics|Elections|Europeanization|European Parliament|European Politics|Euroscepticism|Media Studies|Topic Modeling,2018-10-16T17:40:45.447369,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:40:15.293500,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/citation/,7d9bx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7qapj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/relationships/node/,7qapj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5cb188811c100185545d5/,5bc5cb188811c100185545d5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7d9bx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7d9bx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7d9bx,NA

However, because experiments have traditionally been carried out by un-monitored humans, we do not fully understand the role of force in wear formation. Here we compare the amount of wear produced by duration vs. applied force in a controlled experiment and using both the inspection of optical images and quantitative parameters describing surface topography. We used flint flakes attached to a force/ torque controllable robot arm to scrape standardized beech wooden planks under constant force profiles. The force profiles were obtained by previous experiments in scraping described in Pfleging et al. (2015). We varied the force level and use duration among the experiments. Worn pieces were imaged with an Alicona InfiniteFocus G4 microscope and the polished parts of the flakes were analysed using areal field parameters from metrology. The data is publicly available on the internet. Results indicate that use duration contributes more significantly to polish formation than force, confirming assumptions made in human experiments performed in the 1980s. Moreover, simple metrological height parameters appear inadequate for capturing the degree of polish. We conclude that more sophisticated quantitative methods are required to go beyond the subjective human evaluation of optical images to reconstruct past human action.",TRUE,FALSE,controlled experiment|fractal analysis|height parameters|metrology|micro-wear|robot,2018-10-16T11:23:01.302011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T11:22:44.500197,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/citation/,cseb4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/purce/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/relationships/node/,purce,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc50da653cec4001bac6a9e/,5bc50da653cec4001bac6a9e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cseb4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cseb4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cseb4,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-018-0729-0

However, their application to both criminal and tort liability of children remains inconsistent. Furthermore, rarely has an interdisciplinary approach adequately dealt with these concepts and their impact on legal norms. This text investigates the notion of criminal and tort liability age in connection with the notion of capacity responsibility, in relation to children, and further questions the adequacy of the relevant legal norms. This endeavour to improve the applicable legal norms is supported by an analysis of the pertinent ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of psychology, particularly in respect of the moral development of children. Informed by an excursion through the ideas of Piaget, Kohlberg, and Gilligan, among others, regarding the moral development of children, the text also serves to assess the impact of concepts of moral responsibility and maturity, in relation to the development of the legal norms, which determine the age of liability of children.

A fixed effects approach.,"Objective: In this study, we examine how individuals are affected by the change in status to grandparenthood for the first time.
Background: Being a grandparent, especially an active and involved grandparent, is positively linked to the well-being of individuals with grandchildren, however little is known about how becoming a grandparent affects well-being.
Method: We use longitudinal data from fifteen countries in Europe (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe - SHARE) to analyse if becoming a grandparent is associated with three measures of subjective well-being. We use fixed effects models to account for unobserved heterogeneity.
Results: We found evidence that becoming a first-time grandparent is associated with fewer depressive symptoms among women, although there was no effect on subjective life expectancy or life satisfaction. For men, we found no evidence for an impact on any outcome tested, although there is an association with increased subjective life expectancy conditional on employment status; only if men were employed when transitioning to grandparenthood. We also found no evidence that actively looking after the grandchild is important for either gender.
Conclusion: These results suggest that, at least for women, it is the life transition itself that impacts on well-being, rather than active grandchild-care.

This essay proposes that most theories of poverty can be productively categorized into three broader families of theories: behavioral, structural, and political. Behavioral theories concentrate on individual behaviors as driven by incentives and culture. Structural theories emphasize the demographic and labor market context, which causes both behavior and poverty. Political theories contend that power and institutions cause policy, which causes poverty, and moderates the relationship between behavior and poverty. I review each theory’s arguments, contributions and challenges. Further, I explain how to integrate, classify studies into, and distinguish between theories. Ultimately, I argue that poverty research would benefit from more explicit theory and theoretical debate, as well as greater interdisciplinarity and integration between studies of the U.S., rich democracies, and developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,inequality|poor|poverty|power resources|social policy|theory,2018-10-15T11:02:01.241656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-15T11:01:40.619645,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",David Brady,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/citation/,jud53,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fdsn3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/relationships/node/,fdsn3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc408a02aa873001bc5b8e0/,5bc408a02aa873001bc5b8e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jud53/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jud53,NA

For economists in the 1960s such models were “big science”, posing organizational as well as theoretical and empirical problems. It was part of an even larger industry in which the messiness for which such models were later criticized was endorsed as providing enabling modelers to be guided by data and as offering the flexibility needed to undertake policy analysis and to analyze the consequences of events.
