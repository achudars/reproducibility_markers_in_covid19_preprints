The aim of this study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives and mental health and wellbeing of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK.

Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services and the police force. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a reflexive thematic approach. 

Results: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient PPE and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. 

Conclusion: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (e.g. seasonal influenza) in the future. This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|frontline services|keyworkers|psychological wellbeing|qualitative,2021-02-19T08:54:03.195316,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T08:53:10.036611,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/citation/,dn43c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e85f64ad52e00ea6e91ee/,602e85f64ad52e00ea6e91ee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dn43c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dn43c,NA

Using original national online survey data collected in June 2020 (N=1,027), we investigate how members of this group view the government's overall response. Although survey results show broad support for the federal government's pandemic response, findings also indicate fractures based on disability type and specific health condition, political partisanship, region, and experiences with COVID-19. Among these, identification with the Liberal party and receipt of CERB stand out as associated with more positive views.

Recursive partitioning as an alternative to parametric regression models in social sciences,"Parametric regression models became the dominant tool of quantitative sociology. This dominance is not without its challenges and many criticisms have been expressed, both statistically and epistemologically. Still, the development of data mining, and then of machine learning, has led to the emergence of methodological approaches that make it possible to overcome most of the limitations of parametric regression models, for the various types of use that are of interest to the social sciences. We argue that recursive partitioning in particular may be highly vauable for social sciences. Indeed, this approach has a number of technical advantages over parametric regression and, above all, it is consistent with a conception of social determinations in terms of configurations of interdependent factors (and not of additions of independent factors). In a second step, we review a range of tools for interpreting the results obtained from recursive partitioning algorithms. Together, they form a very complete toolbox for the social sciences and show that recursive partitioning is no longer a black box as soon as the appropriate interpretative tools are mobilized. Finally, we illustrate the methods presented using sociological examples from the world of cinema. In doing so, we will show that these methods make it possible to deal with the different types of problems that arise in the social sciences when parametric regressions are usually used, in this case the study of structure effects and the ranking of explanatory factors.",TRUE,FALSE,cinema|decision tree|random forest|recursive partitioning|regression models|supervised learning,2021-02-18T12:28:22.496650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-18T12:27:53.864037,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Nicolas Robette,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/citation/,z496a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e5a5934d30400bce3a774/,602e5a5934d30400bce3a774,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z496a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z496a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z496a,NA

The critical features of GVCs are therefore the international dimension of the production process and the ""contractualisation"" of buyer and seller relationships, often across international borders (Antras 2016). As a result, these international production networks are highly complex regarding geography, technology, and the different types of firms involved (from large retailers and highly large-scale mechanised manufacturers to small home-based production). Sometimes it may be impossible even to identify all the countries that are involved or the extent of their involvement (Gereffi and FernandezStark 2016). However, the recent development of OECD-WTO’s Trade-in Value Added (TiVA) data represents a fundamental step forward in understanding GVC trade.

Methodology/approach - Regression models are fitted to data from an original sample of 589 employed U.S. parents.
Findings –Partnered (married and cohabiting) fathers who work partially in the evening or night experience less work-to-family conflict if they report personal motives, but schedule motivation does not affect work-to-family conflict among partnered or single mothers.  Partnered mothers who work primarily in the evening or at night report higher life satisfaction if they do so for personal reasons, but this effect is not found for single mothers or partnered fathers.  Specifically seeing their schedules as facilitating family care matters for partnered mothers, but not fathers.  
Originality/value – Although nonstandard employment schedules have been linked to poor well-being among working parents, this is the first quantitative study to assess the role of worker motivation to the author’s knowledge. 
Research limitations/implications – The results are suggestive because they are based on a non-probability sample of modest size.  However, they demonstrate the need for future studies of employment scheduling to collect information on worker motivations.
Social implications – Most night workers in the U.S. do not select their shifts for personal reasons, putting them at risk for work-to-family conflict and reduced life satisfaction.  They deserve extra support in exchange for laboring while others sleep or spend time with family.",TRUE,FALSE,employed fathers|; employed mothers|life satisfaction|nonstandard work schedules|work family conflict,2021-02-19T05:12:44.484312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:12:28.210649,FALSE,NA,no,The data have not been prepared for public access (yet).

Mentoring, whether through formal or informal counseling or coaching, is one way to offer assistance to such students.2 Mentors can provide critical support as students contemplate and pursue completion of higher degrees and pursue occupations that directly serve their communities. During COVID–19 lockdowns, as classes and work became remote, mentoring also transitioned online to electronic mentoring or e–mentoring. E–mentoring was implemented formally by some universities,3 and informally by independent researchers. One female independent researcher of color had a research team consisting of 7 female colleagues in 6 countries and 7 female student researchers (she mentored 2 in–person, e–mentored 5). Since all the students represented different racial and ethnic backgrounds, they offer this unique collection of e–mentoring case studies during the pandemic. The lead author mentored all 7 student authors of this paper. The senior author, also a female independent researcher of color shared her e–mentoring experiences. All of these e–mentoring relationships were created informally. Sharing these independent field reports should not be assumed to be a representation of any of the students’ 6 universities, rather as a sample of what can be achieved by invested e–mentors. By sharing these anecdotal experiences, the authors, particularly the lead and senior authors, hope to call upon all researchers of underrepresented groups to consider e–mentoring to support underrepresented student researchers for the benefit of diversification in the public health research field.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|electronic mentoring|e-mentoring|female researchers|mentoring|remote learning|student researchers,2021-02-19T05:14:41.930540,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:14:09.149387,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/citation/,rsa7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602d7304865bfa0025ecf2a5/,602d7304865bfa0025ecf2a5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rsa7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rsa7t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rsa7t,NA

Concurrently, urban economists have identi?ed that cities and metro areas within a coherent, connected system of cities have population distributions that follow a power law. Further, subpopulations with equal mobility should also have pop- ulation distributions that follow a power law. Using this insight, we introduce a novel method for identifying whether or not racial segregation between metro areas is due to geographical patterns of immigration into coherent systems or due to constrained mobility. We demonstrate the potential of this method by measuring the coherence of the U.S. urban system from 1910-2010 for the white, Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations. Black residents were only distributed across cities in a coherent system after the Great Migration, while Asian and Hispanic residents reached coherence more quickly and stayed coherent more consistently. It appears the Black reverse migration to the south has unsettled their power law distribution. We also ?nd that the size of those networks di?er across populations, and these di?erences are not an artifact of the relative size of the di?erent populations. We conclude with more potential applications of the methodology.",TRUE,FALSE,city growth|methodology|Pareto distribution|residential mobility|segregation|urban,2021-02-19T05:13:42.166515,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:13:11.519619,FALSE,NA,no,Data available on project repository but link won't work: https://osf.io/h5evw/,,no,"Introduces new method, not preregistered",,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/citation/,p5tuh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4xr3w/,4xr3w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602d71c4409da4002ed19340/,602d71c4409da4002ed19340,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p5tuh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p5tuh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p5tuh,NA

The model was first formalized by a group of engineers and economists associated with engineering professor Fred Schweppe, at MIT. From his position as a leading control theorist, well-known in the industry, Schweppe proposed an expansion of control theory that he argued would help break the deadlock in regulatory politics and benefit producers and consumers of power alike. He introduced the approach, which he called “homeostatic control” around 1978 in a seminar of the MIT Energy Lab. Derived by way of a biological metaphor, homeostatic control conceives of a self-correcting system that maintains its equilibrium state in the face of a changing environment. As Schweppe and his collaborators put it, their aim was “an efficient, internally-correcting control scheme” . Homeostatic control marked a departure from the “load-following” approach of system operators, who would constantly adjust the dispatch of power to meet the changing demand, or load. Schweppe’s group envisioned bringing consumers of power into the control system by constantly feeding them signals in the form of prices. The MIT team discovered through the contact between economists and engineers, the calculation for determining efficient prices is identical to the calculation used by engineers for meeting system load while minimizing costs. The Lagrange multipliers, or lambdas, derived from the engineering optimization are the best estimates of the marginal cost, and therefore the efficient prices, at each node of the system.",TRUE,FALSE,electricity markets|engineering|market design,2021-02-19T05:01:41.410685,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19T05:01:14.577026,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/citation/,8pe49,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602d5db17bf1b7001e5367b8/,602d5db17bf1b7001e5367b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pe49/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8pe49/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8pe49,https://doi.org/10.1215/00182702-8718023
