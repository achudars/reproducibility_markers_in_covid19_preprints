Using novel survey data samples of SNAP recipients and Census Pulse survey data, we examine the socio-economic insecurities faced by low-income/benefits-eligible households during the early months of the crisis. Five repeated online surveys of SNAP recipients included measures of perceived and realized housing insecurity, food scarcity, new debt accrual, and recent job loss as indicators of Covid-induced shocks. We then compared our SNAP beneficiaries data to the Census data from a similar period on job loss, food insecurity, and housing precarity. Food insecurity and debt accrual worsened significantly between April and June 2020. Job losses also compounded, albeit at a slower rate. The proportion of respondents reporting multiple types of precarity increased over the month. Compared to Latinx and White respondents, Black respondents were more likely to experience Covid-induced precarity across three out of four indicators, and they experienced more types simultaneously on average.

In particular, we consider two goals of such an agreement: overcoming free-rider problems and adjusting for differences in mitigation costs between countries. Previous work suggests that it is difficult to achieve both of these goals at once under asymmetric information because countries free ride by exaggerating their abatement costs. We argue that independent information collection (investigations) by an international organization can mitigate this problem. In fact, though the best implementable climate agreement without investigations fails to adjust for individual differences even with significant enforcement power, a mechanism with investigations allows such adjustment and can allow implementation of the socially optimal agreement. Furthermore, when the organization has significant enforcement power the optimal agreement is achievable with minimal investigation costs.

We show that the British population displays considerably more tolerant views towards homosexuality compared to the end of the
1980s. However, there is evidence that this has slowed over recent years, especially in areas that have experienced the highest levels of immigration, particularly from countries outside Europe.

The similarity is assessed in order of discovery, with newer sites being evaluated against older ones. Despite evidence for time-dependent site loss due to taphonomy, little attention has been paid to how this impacts archaeological interpretations about the spatial extents of material culture similarity. This paper tests the hypothesis that spatially incomplete datasets result in detection of larger regions of similarity. To avoid assumptions of cultural processes, we apply subsampling algorithms to a naturally occurring, spatially distributed dataset of soil types. We show that there is a negative relationship between the percentage of points used to evaluate similarity across space and the absolute distances to the first minimum in similarity for soil classifications at multiple spatial scales. This negative relationship indicates that incomplete spatial datasets lead to an overestimation of the area over which things are similar. Moreover, the location of the point from which the calculation begins can determine the size of the region of similarity. This has important implications for how we interpret the spatial extent of similarity in material culture over large distances in prehistory.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|spatial analysis|spatial averaging,2020-06-16T13:49:28.761132,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-16T13:48:53.006005,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/european-soil-database-v20-vector-and-attribute-data,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/citation/,gn2cv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b9hdc/,b9hdc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee8c9f35ff596004b3ad0c0/,5ee8c9f35ff596004b3ad0c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn2cv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gn2cv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gn2cv,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-00635-3

Background: Despite evidence that divorce reduces longevity due to economic losses, research has not established which among several common economic resources related to divorce are most important for older women’s survival. There is also relatively little research on why marital inequalities in mortality are smaller among older Black women. Drawing from diverse areas of scholarship, we hypothesize that group differences in multiple economic resources explain this finding. Method: Fractional logistic regression and Gompertz proportional hazards models were estimated with data from the NLS-MW (N=4,668; nlsinfo.org) to examine the associations between divorce, economic resources, and mortality among older Black and White women (born 1923-1937). Results: Divorced White women had significantly less housing and financial wealth than their continuously married counterparts, and Both Black and White divorcées had less vehicle wealth and higher probabilities of indebtedness. With respect to survival, net worth and housing wealth accounted for the largest reductions in marital and racial differences in survival.  Conclusion: Findings suggest that wealth—home wealth in particular—is key to understanding the greater longevity of married White women compared to Black women and divorced White women.

Employing different dimensions of knowledge in terms of intellectus and ratio, the study argues that subjective, emotional and relational processes of teachers’ digital competence need to be prioritized in contrast to the easily measurable aspects that tend to overrun the discussions about educational digitalization and its knowledge in society.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Digital kompetens|distance teaching|Distansundervisning|Education|home schooling|Intellectus|Lärare|Online teaching|quarantine|Ratio|remote teaching|School closure|Skola|Skolnedstängning|Social precense|Utbildning,2020-06-18T20:29:04.505871,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T20:28:33.459163,FALSE,NA,no,The data concerns young students and are not open to the public due to ethical concerns.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/citation/,bvca3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s6gk3/,s6gk3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee7916ec2f677000ead1981/,5ee7916ec2f677000ead1981,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvca3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bvca3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bvca3,NA

Scholars have invariably answered this question in the language of ownership and control. This paper argues that tackling this question today requires a new language. Whereas the comparative political economy literature has long treated dispersed ownership and weak shareholders as core features of the U.S. political economy, a century-long process of re-concentration has consolidated shareholdings in the hands of a few very large asset management companies. In an historically unprecedented configuration, this emerging asset manager capitalism is dominated by fully diversified shareholders that lack direct economic interest in the performance of individual portfolio companies. The paper compares this new corporate governance regime to its predecessors; reconstructs the history of the growth and consolidation of the asset management sector; and examines the political economy of asset manager capitalism, both at the firm level and at the macroeconomic level.",TRUE,FALSE,asset management|comparative political economy|corporate governance|corporate ownership,2020-06-18T01:32:20.799074,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:32:05.984759,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/|https://www.icifactbook.org,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/citation/,v6gue,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3a97z/,3a97z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee76d4936a16d00dbe9c471/,5ee76d4936a16d00dbe9c471,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v6gue/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v6gue/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v6gue,NA

This  finding could help explain the rapid spread and high death toll of the virus in some European countries compared to others in the initial stage.  Looking at differences within a specific country in a well identified setting eliminates biases due to different social structures, healthcare systems, specific policies and measures, and testing procedures for the virus that can confound estimates and hinder comparability across countries.  Further,we use individual level data as well as Apple mobility data to investigate potential mechanisms.  The results highlight the cultural dimension of the spread and could suggest the implementation of targeted mitigation measures in light of disease outbreaks",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Culture|Germany|infectious diseases|Social intercations|Social ties,2020-06-16T12:48:00.716806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-16T12:47:44.744652,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4|https://www.destatis.de/DE/Home/_inhalt.html,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/citation/,z4ndc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee7412044eab500e252172d/,5ee7412044eab500e252172d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4ndc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z4ndc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z4ndc,NA
