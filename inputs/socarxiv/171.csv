To find the effectiveness and the impact of role-play as a teaching strategy, a quasi-experimental method was employed by using a pretest-posttest design wherein the pre and posttest results of 70 EFL students from experimental and the control groups were compared. The experimental group was taught some new areas of grammar, functions and vocabulary using role-play; simultaneously, the control group was taught the same items using the traditional method of teaching. The pretest revealed no significant difference in the knowledge level of the students between the two groups. On the other hand, the posttest results showed that there was a significant difference in the knowledge level of the students in favour of the experimental group. Further, a structured questionnaire was used to understand the perspective of the teachers on the efficacy of role-play in the assessment of students in the English language classes. A sample size of 20 teachers was used where it was found that role-play had a significant impact on the formative assessment. The findings of the study suggested role-play as an effective technique for the undergraduate English-major students in Saudi Arabia to solve the classroom interpersonal troubles, and it would help the students to imbibe the human-relation along with increasing their proficiency in the English language.",TRUE,FALSE,English language teaching|English major students|formative assessment|role-play|Saudi Arabia|teaching method,2020-10-08T21:35:07.362447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-08T21:34:43.168554,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/citation/,8tymv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e7c751f65a5013bed67b8/,5f7e7c751f65a5013bed67b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tymv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8tymv/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.36,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8tymv

This review is written to provide English language learners – and others – who are taking undergraduate-level courses in linguistics, with in-depth advice on how to best support and augment their previously assigned textbooks. Specifically, the author seeks to make a case for how these two dictionaries are the most constructive for students taking courses that focus on semantics and pragmatics. Both of these texts contain extensive and detailed knowledge for students majoring in English. The reviewer examines key aspects of the two volumes in this comparison, including: front and back matter, range of contents and illustrations, and the organization of the entries. Other areas that are explored are how each dictionary deals with connotational meaning, collocational information, expressions related to the headword, and controversial usage issues. The findings of this author reveal that both texts are valuable additions to the library of any undergraduate student studying linguistics and the English language. Each volume has its strong points, making both dictionaries beneficial and essential to students of English.

It has two research questions: 1) What are the conceptual metaphors underlying the linguistic expressions of the English verb of visual perception see in fiction writing and 2)  What are the theoretical implications of MIND-AS-BODY theory on the motivation of conceptual metaphors underlying the  English verb of visual perception see. This study adopts a qualitative approach and is situated within the field of cognitive semantics. A corpus of English fiction writing between the period of 2010 and 2017 was compiled from different sources comprising one million words.  Specifically, a sample consisting of 1,000 examples of the English verb of visual perception see was randomly extracted from the corpus using the AntConc 3.5.0 concordancer. The Metaphor Identification Procedures (MIP) were used to identify the metaphorical linguistic expressions in the corpus, and Lakoff and Johnson's (2003) as well as Sweetser's (1990) analytical frameworks were adopted for data analysis. The data analysis revealed various conceptual metaphors underlying the English verb see. These conceptual metaphors are related to the domains of knowledge, intellections, and understanding which support  Sweetser's claim regarding the primacy of vision in motivating metaphors of cognition in human speech and thought. Thus, this study contributes to the literature on verbs of perception, particularly verbs of visual perception, as it is the first to address the conceptual metaphors underlying the verb see in  English using a real authentic corpus of fiction writing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-08T21:35:40.808376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-08T21:35:31.138584,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/citation/,bctsf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e7a9a1f65a5013bed5fdf/,5f7e7a9a1f65a5013bed5fdf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bctsf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bctsf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.34,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bctsf

This study aimed at exploring the advantages of Learners' Self-Assessment Tasks (LSATs) by B.A. English-major students, University of Bisha. The data collected through a questionnaire and informal interviews with the students who experienced LSATs during their classes. The study indicated that LSATs create awareness and dynamic progress in enhancing the students' learning process. In the data procured, around 75% of participants found LSATs helpful for improving their English skills. It strengthens the factors related to a learner's skills, motivation, and engagement in the development of learning English as a Second Language (ESL). Learners were also able to achieve and receive constructive and indirect feedback. The results showed that LSATs fosters the students' autonomy in learning ESL. Few significant shortcomings of LSATs highlight that quite a few students' were hesitant to get involved and engage themselves in specific self-assessment tasks and activities; lack of the desired proficiency in ESL is and could be one of the few important reasons. Productive and successful self-assessment tasks can be aimed at following requisite guidelines, which this study shows and explores.

Linguistically speaking, although expatriates living outside their home countries master English more than their native words, they can circulate both locations comfortably. However, both languages fail to provide them with an efficient means of expressing their identity.  The main question raised is whether language contributes to the understanding of the self or complicates the maturation process and engenders an identity crisis. It is for this particular reason that the researcher has chosen Cristina Garcia Dreaming in Cuban (1990) to portray how both languages are simultaneously used, creating a third language structure, this narrative that blends English with Spanish without making the reader notice the shift and enabling both the writer and the protagonist to express their bicultural identities.  The aim of the current study is to investigate how linguistic meaning is used as a vehicle for constructing identity through a critical stylistic analysis of Christina Garcia’s Dreaming in Cuban (1990). The study concludes that this novel cannot be classified as either nostalgic or creative, but blends nostalgia with creativity so as to give birth to a new category of exile writing.

The current study inquires about the students’ perception regarding how Saudi students perceive the relationship between the lack of appropriate schemata and the comprehension of English and American poetry to explain how they read and interpret poems in English and how they respond to the culturally loaded texts by writers with different cultural schemata to provide a greater understanding of the challenges they face in the poetry classroom. The study also examines students’ openness to schema activation techniques within the poetry classroom. A qualitative and quantitative research study has been conducted in three undergraduate classrooms at King Saud University. The research included open questions and questionnaire data obtained over a one year period (2018-2019) from 51 students. The results show that Saudi students’ are very much aware of the problematic issues in their reading and believe social and cultural ideologies have a significant influence on comprehension based on their individual experience.

More specifically, it aims to examine how the participants’ educational background, life experiences and professional setting influence their professional identities as EFL teachers in Saudi secondary schools. This study involved three EFL teachers who are based in Riyadh. Employing a case study method, the data collection techniques of this qualitative study included in-depth interviews and observations. Drawing upon Wenger’s (1998) concept of communities of practice, the data analysis reveals several factors affecting the EFL Saudi teachers’ professional identity. This study found that the Saudi teachers’ educational background and life experiences act as formative elements which influence their EFL professional identity formation. Moreover, the participating teachers agree that practical experience and teaching community played a more significant role than their educational background in terms of shaping their teacher’s identity construction and their classroom practices. The results have many implications for Saudi Arabia's development of current teacher education programme. If teacher education curriculum is aimed at improving the professional identity building of EFL teachers, then the policymakers might need to review the curricula of English language teacher education and incorporate some improvements within the programme.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL teacher|identity formation|professional development|Saudi Arabia,2020-10-09T18:11:01.959880,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:10:25.985252,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/citation/,r3wc9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e74fda5e94701241bde35/,5f7e74fda5e94701241bde35,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3wc9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r3wc9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.27,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r3wc9

Central to task-based interaction is the repetition of the same task. Task repetition (TR) stimulates cognitive skills for speech learning and functionality. It has been emphasised in research and practice how task repetition boosts learner processing tools by fortifying form-meaning correlations, facilitating lexicon integration, and providing practical expertise. This study aims to examine the impact of TR on reading comprehension of EFL learners, focusing on individual reading performance and group differences in familiar and recycled tasks. A total of 50 students participated in the current study. The participants were divided into two sample groups (25 male and female respondents). A quantitative research method was utilised in the data analysis. Data management and analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 24.0 (2019). Results indicated that content familiarity and TR significantly impact participants’ reading skill. In addition, this study provides insights into how teachers may utilise TR within L2 lessons to support learners’ language production. The findings observed in this study mirror those of the previous studies which have reported TR as being an effective tool for enhancing reading comprehension. The study concludes by discussing pedagogical implications on the role of TR in L2 learning within EFL contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Reading comprehension|Saudi EFL learners|second language|task complexity|task repetition,2020-10-09T18:11:21.608955,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:10:46.775118,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/citation/,9hn6k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e73b91f65a5013bed4163/,5f7e73b91f65a5013bed4163,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hn6k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9hn6k/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.26,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9hn6k
