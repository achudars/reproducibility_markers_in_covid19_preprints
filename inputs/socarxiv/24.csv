China’s hukou policy creates a boundary between urban and rural residents, which also takes the form of locals and nonlocals in rural-to-urban migration. Urban public schools with a mix of local and migrant students offer a chance to observe the intergroup relationships between local and nonlocal students as well as their parents. Using the two waves of data of the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), this study examines how changes in the migrant friends, schoolmates, and neighbors of local children affect changes in their parents’ prejudice among a sample of 1,630 student-parent pairs. With longitudinal data, this study mitigates the effect of reverse causality between intergroup contact and prejudice. The findings show that parents whose children have more migrant friends have less prejudice, under certain conditions. Additionally, more nonlocal students in the school are related to less prejudice, especially among parents who are more embedded in the school. Furthermore, local families with low socioeconomic status experience an increase in prejudice, potentially due to an increased feeling of threat. Besides, this article finds that prejudiced attitudes spread through the social networks of children and parents at the school level. This study emphasizes the importance of different contexts of meeting opportunities and sheds new light on the generalizability of the contact hypothesis to the understudied context of Chinese internal migration.",TRUE,FALSE,China|contact hypothesis|friendship|internal migration|neighborhoods|parental involvement|prejudice|schools|social learning,2021-05-01T03:16:01.030274,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-01T03:15:22.244133,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://ceps.ruc.edu.cn/English/Home.htm,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/citation/,q4pg7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6083e4ed7166fa0029e90e45/,6083e4ed7166fa0029e90e45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4pg7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q4pg7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q4pg7,NA

Evidence from a Vignette Experiment,"Today, there are more survey results available than ever before. This increase in survey data is, however, accompanied by a decline in survey quality. Thus, it is more likely than in the past that citizens and politicians get a biased picture of public opinion when relying on survey results. Those misperceptions can have worrying consequences for political discourse and decision-making. With the present study, we aim to investigate to what extent the public draws on survey quality information when evaluating the trustworthiness of a survey result. To explore this research question, we implemented a vignette experiment in an online panel survey (n = 3,313) in which each respondent was confronted with four different, randomly assigned descriptions of a survey and then asked to evaluate the trustworthiness of the respective survey result. The survey descriptions varied regarding the methodological information provided (i.e., sample size, sampling method, and sample balance). The results showed that survey quality information only had a minor effect on the perceptions of trust compared to respondents’ characteristics, such as pre-existing opinions on the topic or general trust in science. Yet, trust in the survey result was significantly influenced by the sample size and sample balance, but not by the sampling method.

The literature on clergy attrition is peppered with claims of alarmingly high rates of departure, however, these studies lack strong empirical support. The evidence, while fragmentary, consistently shows that pastors do not leave congregational ministry in large numbers. Incidence of attrition of about 1–2 percent per year is typical across Protestant denominations and among Roman Catholic priests. In addition, contrary to popular conceptions, there is little evidence attrition is particularly high in the first 5 years of congregational ministry. In terms of the reasons for leaving, among Protestants, the most common factor named is conflict with the congregation or denominational system; a smaller number leave to pursue personal goals or to care for family. Among Catholics, loneliness and isolation, tied in major part to the celibacy requirement, are the most significant reasons cited for leaving.

Two priors are strategically close on a class of games if players receive similar expected payoffs in equilibrium under the priors, for any game in that class. I show that if the structure of payoff interdependencies is sparse in a well-defined sense, the conditions for strategic proximity in anonymous local games are strictly weaker than the conditions for general Bayesian games of Kajii and Morris [11] when attention is restricted to symmetric equilibria. Hence, by exploiting the properties of anonymous local games, it is possible to obtain stronger robustness results for this class.",TRUE,FALSE,Higher-order beliefs|Incomplete information games|local interaction games|Network games,2021-04-22T16:48:02.283011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-22T16:47:27.728793,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/citation/,rk6vs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6081983d65e48b009434f224/,6081983d65e48b009434f224,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rk6vs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rk6vs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rk6vs,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2010.10.003

Design: Cross-sectional data was analyzed across three livestreaming platforms and six food and beverage categories: alcohol, candy, energy drinks, snacks, sodas, and restaurants.
Setting: Stream titles of livestreamed events as well as corresponding hours watched on Twitch, Facebook Gaming, and YouTube Gaming.
Participants: None
Results: There were significant differences between food and beverage brand mentions across all three studied platforms (p&lt;0.05), as well as hours watched (p&lt;0.05). Energy drinks dominated food and beverage brand mentions across platforms, followed by restaurants, soda, and snacks. All platforms demonstrated growth over the 17-month data collection period. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted both immediate and sustained growth across all platforms, with the greatest impact observed on the Twitch platform.
Conclusions: Food and beverage marketing as measured through stream titles is widely prevalent across the three most popular livestreaming platforms, particularly for energy drinks. Food marketing on these platforms experienced growth over the past 17-months which was accelerated substantially by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future work should assess the sustained impact this growth may have on marketing practices and eating behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,Food Marketing; Twitch; Streaming; Influencers; Energy Drinks,2021-04-27T07:57:04.938225,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-27T07:56:20.139077,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,The Pennsylvania State University,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/citation/,gbc4f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60817cb32952d8006e8e08cf/,60817cb32952d8006e8e08cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbc4f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gbc4f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gbc4f,NA

The impact of working from home on the division of unpaid work during the COVID-19 lockdown","A lockdown implies a shift from the public to the private sphere, and from market to non-market production, thereby increasing the volume of unpaid work. Already before the pandemic, unpaid work was disproportionately borne by women. This paper studies the effect of working from home for pay (WFH), due to a lockdown, on the change in the division of housework and childcare within couple households. While previous studies on the effect of WFH on the reconciliation of work and family life and the division of labour within the household suffered from selection bias, we are able to identify this effect by drawing upon the shock of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. The corresponding legal measures left little choice over WFH. In any case, WFH is exogenous, conditional on a small set of individual and household characteristics we control for. We employ data from a survey on the gendered aspects of the lockdown. The dataset includes detailed information on time use during the lockdown and on the quality and experience of WFH. Uniquely, this survey data also includes information on the division, and not only magnitude, of unpaid work within households. Austria is an interesting case in this respect as it is characterized by very conservative gender norms. The results reveal that the probability of men taking on a larger share of housework increases if men are WFH alone or together with their female partner. By contrast, the involvement of men in childcare increased only in the event that the female partner was not able to WFH. Overall, the burden of childcare, and particularly homeschooling, was disproportionately borne by women.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Division of Labour|Feminist Economics|Gender|Homeschooling|Time use|Unpaid Work|Work from Home,2021-04-22T10:36:21.057190,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-22T10:28:56.545130,FALSE,NA,no,The dataset and code files are available upon request,,not_applicable,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Judith Derndorfer|Franziska Disslbacher|Vanessa Lechinger|Katharina Mader|Eva Six,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/citation/,5ypb2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608149222952d8006e8d8511/,608149222952d8006e8d8511,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ypb2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ypb2,NA
