A time series analysis of cybercrime and fraud trends during COVID-19","There have been many warnings about the rising threat of cybercrime and fraud resulting from the COVID-19 lockdown measures and the associated increase in Internet use. However, there is still relatively little data with which to support the alerts and any changes may be nuanced. The present paper applies time series analysis methods to historical data on cybercrime and fraud reported to Action Fraud in the UK to examine whether any potential increases are beyond normal crime variability. Furthermore, the discrepancies between fraud types and individual and organisation victims are also analysed. The results show that while both total cybercrime and total fraud did increase beyond predicted levels, the changes in victimisation were not homogenous across fraud types and victims.

Previous studies have revealed a rapid increase in the SRB over the past 15 years and the presence of important variations across regions. More recent studies suggested that the nation’s SRB may have plateaued during the 2010s. Given the lack of exhaustive birth registration data in Vietnam, it is necessary to estimate and project levels and trends in the regional SRBs in Vietnam based on a reproducible statistical approach. We compiled an extensive database on regional Vietnam SRBs based on all publicly available surveys and censuses and used a Bayesian hierarchical time series mixture model to estimate and project SRB in Vietnam by region from 1980 to 2050. The Bayesian model incorporates the uncertainties from the observations and year-by-year natural fluctuation. It includes a binary parameter to detect the existence of sex ratio transitions among Vietnamese regions. Furthermore, we model the SRB imbalance using a trapezoid function to capture the increase, stagnation, and decrease of the sex ratio transition by Vietnamese regions. The model results show that four out of six Vietnamese regions, namely, Northern Midlands and Mountain Areas, Northern Central and Central Coastal Areas, Red River Delta, and South East, have existing sex imbalances at birth. The rise in SRB in the Red River Delta was the fastest, as it took only 12 years and was more pronounced, with the SRB reaching the local maximum of 1.146 with a 95% credible interval (1.129, 1.163) in 2013. The model projections suggest that the current decade will record a sustained decline in sex imbalances at birth, and the SRB should be back to the national SRB baseline level of 1.06 in all regions by the mid-2030s.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian hierarchical model|probabilistic projection|sex ratio at birth|sex-selective abortion|subnational modeling|time series models|Vietnam,2021-03-03T14:16:02.797408,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-03T14:15:32.706917,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/citation/,9xrbk,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603f8d17035cf7039fc80d7c/,603f8d17035cf7039fc80d7c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9xrbk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9xrbk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9xrbk

The largest number of international students are from mainland China and some programmes have a large majority of Chinese students. This has raised important questions around the internationalisation of the curriculum in these contexts. While many studies have addressed the needs and challenges of international students there is relatively less work on the potential contributions of these students with respect to the curriculum. This paper conducts a bibliographic analysis of the academic references (n=7,264) used by students to construct their final essays on the theme of education and international development at a ‘leading global university’ based in the UK. It examines (1) what knowledge resources (i.e. references) are used by international students in their essays and (2) what are the characteristics and patterns present in these choices. The study finds that, when allowed to construct their own essays, Chinese students choose to use ‘Chinese’ knowledge resources within English and Anglophone academic essays. This increases when their lecturers and tutors explain and accept the value of non-English academic resources.

Thompson in the 1960s. But the lack of systematic evidence means that many of these questions remain unresolved. This paper makes a modest contribution to the evidence base in this area, using three catalogues of political events to reconstruct the working week in Britain over the long nineteenth century. Three findings emerge. ​First, observance of Saint Monday appears to have been widespread in the early nineteenth century, before declining slowly in the mid-1800s. This therefore supports the dominant narrative about the traditional day of holiday against its recent challengers (in particular, ​Hans-Joachim​ Voth)​. Second, I find that political organisers in the early nineteenth century were reluctant to profane the Sabbath by arranging public meetings on Sundays, but that this came to an end during the heyday of Chartism. Third, these catalogues also provide some, more speculative, evidence that the working day and the working week became more ordered as the nineteenth century wore on.",TRUE,FALSE,historical sociology|industrial revolution|nineteenth century|saint monday|time-use|working hours|working week,2021-03-03T14:09:48.329518,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-03T14:09:25.864016,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/MatteoTiratelli/RiotsAndTimeUse,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce0|Arts and Humanities|History|Social History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/citation/,q2sdj,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603e5d9f035cf70326c823ab/,603e5d9f035cf70326c823ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2sdj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q2sdj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q2sdj

Using data from a large survey collected during the first COVID-19 wave in March 2020 as well as data from Facebook, this paper investigates from which sources (e.g., public or commercial broadcasting, newspapers or Facebook) Germans received news and how information exposure relates to perceptions, attitudes and behaviours concerning COVID-19. Regression analyses based on the survey data show that getting COVID-19-related information from a multitude of sources strongly predicted positive public health outcomes and that no individual source had negative effects. A quantitative text analysis of almost a million German public Facebook posts indicates that the positive individual-level effects might be related to a uniform coverage of COVID-19 that emphasised the severity of the pandemic, whereas misinformation seemed to be less widespread than feared. The results suggest that fears of an `infodemic' may be overstated and that the high salience of COVID-19 in media coverage helped the efforts to mitigate the pandemic. We discuss the findings against the backdrop of an increased politicisation of public-health measures during later COVID-19 waves.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Facebook|Infodemic|Information Exposure|Media|Misinformation,2021-03-03T14:11:04.024461,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-03T14:10:34.158484,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13520,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,NA,Sebastian Stier|Bernd Weiß|Timo Hartmann|Fabian Flöck|Johannes Breuer|Ines Schaurer|Mirjan Schulz,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/citation/,cah76,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4az8v/,4az8v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603e5cf6035cf70319c85693/,603e5cf6035cf70319c85693,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cah76/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cah76/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cah76
