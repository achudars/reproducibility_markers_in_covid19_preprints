This article attempts to help bridge this gap by applying sociolegal concepts to empirical findings about state law’s role in family, and especially in marriage, drawn from across several decades and disciplines of South Africanist scholarly research. I sketch the broad outlines of a nuanced theoretical approach for analyzing the law-family relationship, which insists that the relationship entails a contingent and dynamic interplay between relatively powerful regulating institutions and relatively powerless regulated populations. Accordingly, while my argument broadly distinguishes the more repressive regimes of colonialism and apartheid from the more expansive post-apartheid legal regime, it also partially undoes that periodisation by highlighting limits and evasions of repressive law and obstacles impeding access to post-apartheid law’s expansive promises.",TRUE,FALSE,apartheid|British colonialism|colonialism|family|law and society|marriage|post-apartheid|post-colonial|sociolegal studies|South Africa,2019-05-06T15:09:48.495537,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-04T11:57:19.535352,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c49|Law|Legal History|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5e|Law|Law and Race|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5f|Law|Family Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd2|Arts and Humanities|History|African History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d05|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Women's Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/citation/,hqsb4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccd267a78c993001cd2948e/,5ccd267a78c993001cd2948e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqsb4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hqsb4/,https://doi.org/10.1080/21528586.2015.1100095,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hqsb4

When they do, their methods typically focus on discrete policies in isolation—same-sex marriage, no-fault divorce, etc.—with comparatively little investigation of potential connections among policies. This article begins to develop a more holistic approach focused on identifying and explaining what I call conjugal-recognition regimes. Adapting the concept from the existing literature on welfare regimes, I argue that conjugal-recognition regimes exist when an identifiable pattern or principle organizes an institution’s conjugal-recognition policies. Such regimes shape social relations at multiple levels, both between the individuals in conjugal relationships and among the multiple institutions (state, religious, and so on) that confer official conjugal recognition. I argue that these organizing patterns or principles emerge out of historically specific, institutionally situated, and discursively constructed political debates on specific conjugal issues and, to the extent a regime in fact exists, go on to shape subsequent conjugal-policy controversies. I demonstrate these ideas through an extended analysis of post-apartheid South African marriage law, which has recently incorporated numerous previously excluded conjugal formations but has also assigned each new form to its own statutory and administrative structure or, as I call it, “silo.” I argue that these silos entrench a principle of “gendered multiculturalism” that officially defines cultures in terms of their supposedly characteristic gender relations. This principle increasingly tends to embed religious and cultural elites’ understandings of their respective traditions into the state’s marriage laws.",TRUE,FALSE,African marriage|customary law|customary marriage|gender|historical institutionalism|Islamic marriage|legal pluralism|marriage|multiculturalism|Muslim marriage|policy regimes|post-apartheid|same-sex marriage|South Africa,2019-05-06T15:08:29.657718,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-04T11:56:02.438293,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5f|Law|Family Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c67|Law|Legislation|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/citation/,bg37v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccd1c27103390001a9b3bcb/,5ccd1c27103390001a9b3bcb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bg37v/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxv016,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bg37v

Based primarily on 21 in-depth interviews with such South Africans drawn from a larger project on post-apartheid South African marriage, I argue that their current struggles for relationship recognition share much in common with contemporaneous struggles of their heterosexual counterparts, and that these commonalities reflect ongoing tensions between more extended-family and more dyadic understandings of African marriage.

South African marriage rates have sharply fallen, and many blame this on economic challenges completing lobola. Using in‐depth, qualitative research from a village in KwaZulu‐Natal, where lobola demands are the country's highest and marriage rates its lowest, I argue that lobola's authority survives because lay actors have innovated new approaches for pursuing emerging desires for marriage via lobola. I argue that dyadic narratives of marriage increasingly circulate alongside “traditional” extended‐family narratives, especially among the young women who strongly support lobola while yearning for gender‐egalitarian marriages. My argument synthesizes actor‐oriented analyses of legal pluralism with Ewick and Silbey's theorization of lay actors’ role in producing legality to illuminate how lay actors contribute not only to the form and content of different legal systems, but also to the reach of their authority.",TRUE,FALSE,bridewealth|gender|legal consciousness|legal pluralism|lobola|marriage|post-apartheid|romantic love|South Africa,2019-05-06T15:09:08.693870,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-04T11:56:36.224874,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c6c|Law|Comparative and Foreign Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/citation/,ceywj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/468ye/,468ye,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccd0a2237b4fe00165141fa/,5ccd0a2237b4fe00165141fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ceywj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ceywj/,https://doi.org/10.1111/lsi.12275,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ceywj

The information that feeds into the content on these platforms is provided voluntarily by a vast crowd of knowledgeable users from all over the world. In contributing to the platforms, users invest their time and share knowledge with strangers to add to the rising body of digital knowledge.This requires an open mindset and trust. In this study, we argue that such a mindset is not just an individual asset, but determined by the local communities the users are embedded in. We, therefore, hypothesise that places with higher levels of trust should contribute more to StackOverflow, the world’s largest question-and-answer platform for programming questions. In relating the city-level contributions of 266 OECD metropolitan areas to infrastructure, economic, and trust measures, we find this hypothesis confirmed.

Most
attention focused on assessing levels of racial segregation at the spatial scale of a metropolitan area. In this paper, we present an analysis of 1990-2010 changes to racial diversity and segregation on a much smaller spatial scale of an urban census tract. To access time-standardized racial information at the tract and at the census block scales we use multiyear compatible high-resolution population grids. Indices of racial diversity and segregation are calculated for over 30,000 tracts pooled from 41 metropolitan areas. Statistical analysis of this dataset reveals that during the 1990-2010 period urban tracts increased their diversity in line with diversity increases of entire metro areas, but unlike metros, they also increased their levels of segregation. We hypothesize that an increased tendency for the residences of people of the same race to spatially aggregate on the tract scale is the result of individuals exercising preferences regarding their neighbors in reaction to the nationwide increase in diversity of the American population. The study also re-derives diversity and segregation indices from the first principles of the information theory, highlights the need to think about the issue of racial diversity/segregation in terms of spatial patterns, and uses one-person-per-dot maps to connect diversity/segregation indices to actual racial patterns.",TRUE,FALSE,information theory|Racial diversity|segregation|visualization,2019-05-03T14:28:09.825212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03T14:26:45.575192,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Tomasz F.

Exploring Ireland’s Vegan and Vegetarian Foodscape,"While it would not be accurate to suggest that Ireland is a hub of veganism or vegetarianism, too often it is written off as inherently unsympathetic to the ethics of plant-based eating and anti-speciesist politics. While it is true that Irish culture is historically tied to speciesism and its economy is especially dependent upon “meat” and dairy production, Ireland’s relationship with other animals is complex and sometimes forgiving. This essay seeks to bring shape to the Irish vegan ethic, one that can be traced along its history of animism, agrarianism, ascendency, adaptation, and activism. From its pagan roots to its legacy of vegetarianism, Ireland’s history has been more receptive to Nonhuman Animal interests than might be currently understood. Its contributions to the modern Nonhuman Animal rights movement and developments in green agriculture must also be taken into account. More than a land of “meat” and potatoes, Ireland exists as a relevant, if overlooked, participant in Western vegan thought.",TRUE,FALSE,Animal nationalism|Animal rights|Climate Change|Consumption|Critical Animal Studies|Food|Food History|Green Tourism|Irish nationalism|Irish studies|Nationalism|Veganism|Vegetarianism,2019-05-03T14:22:06.801710,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03T14:21:27.831250,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,Corey Wrenn,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/citation/,t83yg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccaf4f9bbbd37001aa2dbdc/,5ccaf4f9bbbd37001aa2dbdc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t83yg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t83yg

This institutionalized sexism not only inhibits women’s ability to protest safely and effectively, but also permeates the activist imagination and aggravates interpersonal violence. Even Nonhuman Animals as a feminized group are unwittingly disparaged in popular campaigns. This essay suggests that structural sexism in the Nonhuman Animal rights movement is nourished by its patriarchal organization, specifically its decision to professionalize. Twenty-first century vegan feminist activism on the margins has been able to circumvent the hegemony of professionalized power and challenge taken-for-granted bureaucratic structures. Yet, despite indications that vegan feminist activists are influencing the movement dialogue, the movement’s patriarchal norms have encouraged considerable pushback. Indeed, the patriarchal influence of professionalization has even created division between second wave and third wave vegan feminists.",TRUE,FALSE,Animal Rights|Critical Animal Studies|Digital Culture|Digital Protest|Ecofeminism|Factionalism|Feminism|Intersectionality|Nonprofit Industrial Complex|Nonprofits|Professionalization|Social Movements|Solidarity|Veganism,2019-05-03T14:23:07.327391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03T14:22:46.738656,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,Corey Wrenn,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/citation/,jtps8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccaf2cdd7dc3f00176d10d0/,5ccaf2cdd7dc3f00176d10d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jtps8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jtps8
