Despite the strong effects of quotas, less attention has been paid to the factors that prompt countries to adopt electoral quotas across developing countries. This article employs event history modeling to analyze quota adoption in 134 developing countries from 1987 to 2012, focusing on quota type, transnational activism, and norm cascades. The article asks the following questions: (1) How might quota adoption differ according to quota type—nonparty versus party quotas? (2) How has the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China (Beijing 95), contributed to quota diffusion? (3) Do global, regional, or neighboring country effects contribute more to quota adoption? Results provide new evidence of how quota adoption processes differ according to quota type, the central role played by participation in Beijing 95, and how increased global counts contribute to faster nonparty quota adoption while increased neighboring country counts lead to faster to party quota adoption.",TRUE,FALSE,Electoral Quotas|Gender|Parliaments|Politics|Transnational Activism|Women's Movement,2018-07-02T11:14:58.111043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-08T14:37:07.411650,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/citation/,u2bk7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/by79v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/relationships/node/,by79v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59da366b9ad5a102b49b4975/,59da366b9ad5a102b49b4975,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2bk7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2bk7/,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X16000477,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2bk7

Employing discourse analysis of 607 New York Times articles from 1969 to 2014, this paper demonstrates that radicalization discourses are not new, but are the result of complex socio-linguistic and historical developments that cannot be reduced to dominant contemporary understandings of the concept or to singular events or crises. The news articles were then compared to 850 government documents, speeches, and official communications. The analysis of the data indicates that media conceptualizations of radicalization, which once denoted political and economic differences, have now shifted to overwhelmingly focus on Islam. As such, radicalization discourse now evokes the construct radicalization as symbolic marker of conflict between the West and the East.

of science correctly characterizes science, is examined in this paper through the lens of a related
debate, namely whether science is a social construct or not. The latter debate arose in response
to Kuhn’s work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, in which he argued that while there
exists a process through which scientific understanding evolves from primitive to increasingly
refined ideas, it does not describe progress ’toward’ anything. Kuhn’s work was then used to
argue that there is no such thing as a knowable objective reality, a view much in agreement
with that of the instrumentalist.
This paper argues that a generalized version of the correspondence principle applied to a theory’s
domain of validity is an exclusive feature of science which distinguishes it from socially
constructed phenomena and thereby supports the realist position. According to this argument,
progress in science can be characterized as the replacement of old paradigms by new ones with
greater domains of validity which obey the correspondence principle where the two paradigms
overlap. This characterization, however, is susceptible to the instrumentalist objection that it
does not fit the transition from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics. In response, it is required
that this argument depend on the intactness of certain core concepts in the face of experimental
challenge within some regions of the theory’s original domain of validity. While this requirement
saves the argument and even offers an answer to the question of what it would take for our most
established theories in physics, relativity and quantum theory, to suffer the same fate as Aristotelian
physics, it also defers a conclusive resolution to the debate between instrumentalists
and realists until it can be determined whether an ultimate theory of nature can be found.",TRUE,FALSE,Correspondence Principle|Domain of Validity|Instrumentalism|Operationalism|Philosophy of Science|Realism|Social Construction|Thomas Kuhn,2018-07-02T11:14:53.830554,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-05T17:39:41.633555,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,Armin Nikkhah Shirazi,2008,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/citation/,wz2cf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w7t9v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/relationships/node/,w7t9v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59d66cccb83f6902b1d73c95/,59d66cccb83f6902b1d73c95,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wz2cf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wz2cf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wz2cf

Summary answer: The normative cultural acceptance of ART is a major driver of ART treatments in Europe, above and beyond differences in country wealth, demographic aspects, and religious composition.

What is known already: There are vast differences in the number of ART treatments across European countries, which are to some extent related to country affluence, regulation, and insurance coverage and costs. The role and impact of cultural and normative factors has not been explored in a larger cross-national comparison.

Study design, size, duration: A descriptive and comparative cross-national analysis of ART treatment prevalence in over 30 European countries in 2010, with the outcome defined as the total number of ART cycles per million women of reproductive age (15–44 years).  Data is drawn from multiple sources (ICMART, US Census Bureau Library, World Bank, Barro–Lee Educational Attainment Dataset, IFFS Surveillance reports, European Values Study, and World Religion Database).

Participants/materials, setting, methods: Our sample includes data from 35 European countries, where we describe the associations between demographic and cultural factors and the prevalence of ART treatments.  Bivariate correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression analysis serves to establish the relationships between predictor variables and the number of ART treatments per million women aged 15–44 years in a country.

Main results and the role of chance: A one-percent increase in national GDP is associated with 382 (95% CI: 177–587) additional ART procedures per million women of reproductive age, yet this effect is reduced to 99 (-92–290) treatments once cultural values are accounted for.  In our fully adjusted model, normative cultural values about the acceptability of ART are the strongest predictor of ART usage, with a one-point increase of average approval in a country associated with 276 (167–385) additional ART treatments per million women of reproductive age.

Limitations, reasons for caution: Findings are based on a cross-sectional, cross-national analysis, making formal tests of causality impossible and prohibiting inferences to the individual level.

Wider implications of the findings: Results indicate that reproductive health policy should openly acknowledge the importance of cultural norms in informally shaping and regulating the wider availability of ART treatment.",TRUE,FALSE,Assisted reproduction|Assisted Reproductive Technologies|Culture|Europe|In vitro fertilization|Religion,2018-07-02T11:14:53.790962,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-05T12:47:04.021285,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/citation/,tcj94,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q5h6x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/relationships/node/,q5h6x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59b035f4b83f69025183e4dd/,59b035f4b83f69025183e4dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tcj94/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tcj94/,https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dex298,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tcj94

I wrote this in 2007 as a student trying to think about Blade Runner through both religious studies and anthropology. An updated version is in progress.

Excerpt:
""By threatening binary systems and insisting on an identity of plurality, replicants and cyborgs are granted access to a sanctuary in which they can interface with the numinous place of origin; the place Jenna Tiitsman describes as the chaotic “territory of creation.” The following analysis is a journey of exploration to map
the cyborg sanctuaries in that chaotic territory of Tiitsman’s “creative becoming.” This expedition will explore the web of shared conversation between discourse in three regions: investigation into human reactions to robot humanness, relational ordering of religious experience, and the capacity of cyborgs to access the numinous.

At the intersection of these cognitive spaces emergent from the “territory of creation” are conceptual-crossroads where cyborgs mediate access to the supernatural. To situate these emergent conceptual-crossroads within more familiar cognitive spaces with supernatural access, I will refer to them as the temples of cyborgism.""

Keywords: Blade Runner, cyborg, uncanny valley, numinous, creation, supernatural.

New communications technology, especially activists' widespread adoption of social media, calls into question whether these claims apply equally to online social media-based coalitions. Using the case of the Egyptian revolution in the Arab Spring, we conduct a series of social network analyses of the Twitter networks of activists. We find that social movements coalitions theory accurately predicts the conditions under which coalitions form and dissolve for online activists, as it does for on-the-ground activists. Among activists of diverse ideologies, we identify a pattern of solidarity in the early days of the revolutionary period, followed by a period of schism after a military crackdown on protestors.
