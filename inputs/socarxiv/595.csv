These types of response—such as ‘don't know’ or ‘it's up to God’—have often been interpreted through the lens of fertility transition theory as an indication that reproduction has not yet entered women's ‘calculus of conscious choice’ (Coale 1973, p. 65). However, this has yet to be investigated cross-nationally and over time. Using 19 years of data from 32 countries, we find that non-numeric fertility preferences decline most substantially in the early stages of a country’s fertility transition. Using country-specific and multilevel models, we explore the individual- and contextual-level characteristics associated with women’s likelihood of providing a non-numeric response to questions about their fertility preferences. Non-numeric fertility preferences are influenced by a host of social factors, with educational attainment and knowledge of contraception being the most robust and consistent predictors.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|fertility preferences|fertility transitions|numeracy,2018-07-02T11:50:34.987304,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-03T11:51:43.338327,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/citation/,shcvj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5nuyd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/relationships/node/,5nuyd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae9fbbd9a64d7000ce6ab52/,5ae9fbbd9a64d7000ce6ab52,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shcvj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/shcvj/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2017.1304565,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/shcvj

Showing changes in mobility requires both archaeological proxies that are sensitive to movement and a clear understanding of how different mobility configurations influence their patterning. This study uses computer simulation to explore how different combinations of reduction, selection, transport, and discard of stone artifacts generate patterning in the “cortex ratio,” a geometric proxy used to demonstrate movement at the assemblage level. A case study from western New South Wales, Australia, shows how cortex ratios are used to make inferences about movement. Results of the exploratory simulation show that redundancy in movement between discards reduces variability in cortex ratios, while mean assemblage values can be attributed to the relative proportions of artifacts carried into and out of the assemblages. These results suggest that raw material availability is a potentially crucial factor in determining what kinds of mobility are visible in assemblages, whereby different access to raw material can shift the balance of import and export of stone in an otherwise undirected movement configuration. These findings are used to contextualize distributions of cortex ratios from the raw material–rich study area, prompting suggestions for further fieldwork.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|Australia|landscape archaeology|lithic analysis|simulation,2019-05-23T20:50:27.705600,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23T20:49:52.451065,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/citation/,k85q9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/92nyb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/relationships/node/,92nyb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae7c14a91de99000f1a3a46/,5ae7c14a91de99000f1a3a46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k85q9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k85q9/,https://doi.org/10.1017/aaq.2018.23,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k85q9

It maintains that decarbonisation should, similarly to the anthropocene, be thought of as ‘bad universal’, that in fact currently forecloses the difficult political work necessary to address the multiple complex issues of globe-spanning climate change. Its apparently positive conceptual content (the absolute necessity to reduce global emissions) is written precisely through the silences it imposes on the broad array of conflicts, oppressions and impacts that have historically lead to these emissions through the development of fossil-fuel based capitalism. I outline here the processes of exclusion, exploitation and incoherence through which decarbonisation has been developed, institutionally stabilised and propagated, and highlights the incoherencies that this results in.

This influential relationship, often called performativity, has gone largely unnoticed and uncommented on in organizational theory and research. The few studies investigating performativity in organizations or other fields typically focus on cases in which the ultimate success of theory's implementation is known. In this paper, I examine how one high-performing charter school sought to turn a prescribed organizational culture into reality. I find that path to successful performance is very narrow and ambiguous. The school succeeded and failed in many steps of the process, making it difficult to assess whether the initiative was successful and to attribute their successes and failures to the theory or their implementation. I conclude that performativity is a cyclical process occurring at multiple time scales. During these cycles, organizations iteratively test new implementations of the theory, seeking to gain clear insight into the success of their strategy and correctly attribute their successes and failures to decide whether the theory actually works or not.",TRUE,FALSE,Charter Schools|Cultural Theory|Ethnography|Organizational Culture|Performativity Theory|Schools,2018-07-02T11:50:30.575204,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-02T10:32:36.152913,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Jason Radford,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/citation/,8tnfj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ez4bt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/relationships/node/,ez4bt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae7683eefd3260013d9c8f0/,5ae7683eefd3260013d9c8f0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tnfj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8tnfj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8tnfj

Modern central banking is commonly presented as achieving greater efficacy by directly managing economic expectations, in particular when contrasted with the previous heavy-handed, “hydraulic” transmission of policy objectives through systems of economic aggregates. Such empirical claims are mirrored in the theoretical distinction drawn by sociologists between the openness and efficacy of future-oriented coordination of expectations, and the more rigid coordination achieved through formal organizing and formalization.
This paper uses the case of the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) transition to inflation targeting in the 1980s to show how the precision and flexibility of social coordination through expectations in fact relies on extensive formalization and rigid proceduralization. I show that the tightly coupled control relation on which inflation targeting rests is not possible without the constitutive exclusion of other modes of representing and intervening the economy achieved by this formalization. However, the price for the robust and precise reactivity that modern central banking has constructed between key indicators of inflation expectations and the interest rate set by monetary policy, is a comprehensive procedural dis-embedding of monetary policy from the structure of economic activities whose path into the future it is meant to govern.
The paper concludes that in order to better understand the conditions under which future-oriented modes of coordination fail or succeed, we need to study more closely the formalization of social relations on which they are founded.",TRUE,FALSE,central banks;|conventions|economic coordination|expectations|futurity|indicators|inflation|monetary policy,2018-07-02T11:50:30.409254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-02T10:30:38.970762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/citation/,hrz7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/up5jx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/relationships/node/,up5jx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae759aa8453210014ae9701/,5ae759aa8453210014ae9701,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hrz7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hrz7y/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hrz7y

Longitudinal and Cross-sectional Effects of Income Inequality on Trust in U.S. States, 1973–2012","Does income inequality reduce social trust? Although both popular and scholarly accounts have argued that income inequality reduces trust, some recent research has been more skeptical, noting these claims are more robust cross-sectionally than longitudinally. Furthermore, although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for why inequality could affect trust, these have rarely been tested explicitly. I examine the effect of state-level income inequality on trust using the 1973–2012 General Social Surveys. I find little evidence that states that have been more unequal over time have less trusting people. There is some evidence that the growth in income inequality is linked with a decrease in trust, but these effects are sensitive to how time is accounted for. While much previous inequality and trust research has focused on status anxiety, this mechanism receives the little support, but mechanisms based on social fractionalization and on exploitation and resentment receive some support. This analysis improves on previous estimates of the effect of state-level inequality on trust by using far more available observations, accounting for more potential individual and state level confounders, and using higher-quality income inequality data based on annual IRS tax returns. It also contributes to our understanding of the mechanism(s) through which inequality may affect trust.",TRUE,FALSE,income inequality|inequality|misanthropy|social fractionalization|social trust|status anxiety|trust,2018-07-02T11:50:30.362910,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-02T10:30:02.818734,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/citation/,dx8av,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f52ez/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/relationships/node/,f52ez,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae750618453210013ae925b/,5ae750618453210013ae925b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx8av/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dx8av/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.04.005,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dx8av

Specifically, I examine the background of successive and overlapping colonial and neocolonial powers in three eras: late colonial (1901-1941), national developmental (1945-1964), and state authoritarianism (1965-1985). I also briefly examine the current neoliberal mineral regime (1986-present). I argue that, to date, capitalist enterprises and neocolonial powers have pursued two contradictory paths to extract precious (gold and silver) and base (chromite, iron, copper, nickel, magnesium, and ore) metals in the Philippines. On the one hand, mining companies appropriated expansive land, underpriced labor and inexpensive food to subsidize capital expenditure and mineral operations. The appropriation of basic inputs - or what is referred to as ""cheap natures"" - allowed these companies to reduce their sunken investments and operational costs. But on the other hand, as the sector developed more, it became increasingly difficult to appropriate such ""cheap natures."" While initially profitable because of successful appropriation of ""cheap natures,"" companies eventually experienced decreasing returns because of the problems this caused.",TRUE,FALSE,Colonialism|Philippines|Political Economy|Resource Extraction|World-Systems,2018-07-02T11:50:11.794148,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-02T11:57:29.508942,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/citation/,4g65e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q5hzk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/relationships/node/,q5hzk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae49ef430777c000fdcf5ab/,5ae49ef430777c000fdcf5ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4g65e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4g65e/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2015.02.006,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4g65e

As an angle of vision, I use the historical geography of late colonial Philippines (1901–1941) to show how paid and unpaid work in food production was not discrete and separated processes but rather conjoined moments of capital accumulation. The colonial regime—in this context, American colonial government, U.S. agribusinesses, and Filipino landed elites—utilized state power, customary land relations, and commodity‐specific characteristics to appropriate vast amounts of unpaid work from agrarian classes of Philippine labour and draft animals towards the exploitation of commodified labour power. These processes not only produced considerable quantities of coconut and sugar products that were exported to the American consumer market, sold at cheaper prices, and contributed to the profitability of U.S. agribusiness elites but also allowed the colonial regime to efficiently expand commodity production across the islands. The more the American capitalists and Philippine elites invested in Philippine agriculture, the more they appropriated unpaid work from the agrarian classes of labour.",TRUE,FALSE,American Empire|Colonialism|Environmental Sociology|Food Regimes,2018-07-02T11:50:11.715625,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-30T15:25:18.167764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/citation/,qvmkr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bjd3k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/relationships/node/,bjd3k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae49ce07d11e40010800909/,5ae49ce07d11e40010800909,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvmkr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qvmkr/,https://doi.org/10.1111/joac.12269,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qvmkr

Yet many individuals fail to perceive extreme heat as a serious risk. Thus, understanding Americans’ perceptions of heat risk and how such perceptions vary geographically and across different populations is a critical precursor to encouraging adaptive behaviors – such as staying hydrated or refraining from outdoor activity – during heat waves. Using a large original survey dataset of 9,217 respondents, we model Americans’ perceived risk to their health from extreme heat in every populated census tract across the nation. Nationally, risk perceptions are higher in southern states where mortality from heat waves is also highest. However, the extent of variation within states and metropolitan areas is similar to variation between states. Locally, risk perceptions are higher in areas with greater poverty and among minority populations that are more vulnerable to environmental risks in general. We identify  highly vulnerable areas where risk perceptions currently lag heat-related mortality; without concerted adaptation efforts such vulnerability is likely to expand and intensify as heat exposure increases. Comprehensive estimates of extreme heat risk perceptions at the census tract level can support communication, education, and adaptation initiatives in existing and emerging areas most vulnerable to heat in the U.S.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:50:10.713553,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-28T02:34:04.032989,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/citation/,un7zg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bw8u7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/relationships/node/,bw8u7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae3ad1c30777c000edc9ba9/,5ae3ad1c30777c000edc9ba9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/un7zg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/un7zg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/un7zg
