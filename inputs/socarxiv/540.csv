However, the relevance of skin color on status attribution for different status groups has been poorly studied in the region. This article seeks to broaden the research on phenotypic status cues using Chile as a context for analysis – a Latin American country with a narrow although continuous spectrum of skin tones, marked status differences, and a mostly white elite. We draw on status construction theory to hypothesize that skin pigmentation in Chile has become a status cue, although its heuristic relevance could differ across status groups. Using visual stimuli and a repeated measure design, we studied this relationship and tested whether the use of skin pigmentation as a status cue is conditional upon the status of those categorizing others. The results reveal that, although skin pigmentation has a negligible direct effect on status attribution, it does have a conditional effect on the social status of the rater: whereas skin pigmentation does not work as a status cue for lower status participants, it is an important status marker for the categorizations that high-status participants perform. The phenotypic composition of reference groups of low and high-status individuals and system justification are discussed as potential explanations for these results.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-02T22:05:04.554629,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-02T22:04:38.215561,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/citation/,dm65y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d8usv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/relationships/node/,d8usv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bb3b84c4d902600191225ac/,5bb3b84c4d902600191225ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm65y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dm65y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dm65y,NA

Previous studies have shown that life events affect involvement in prosocial behavior, allegedly as a result of loss of human and social capital. Using registry data from the blood collection agency in the Netherlands, linked to longitudinal survey data from the Donor InSight study (n = 20,560), we examined whether life events are related to blood donor lapse. Childbirth, losing a job and starting a job increase the likelihood of lapse; health-related events (i.e., blood transfusion for a family member, death of a family member) decrease the likelihood of lapse. Increasing difficulty to plan a donation, decreasing perceived health status, and knowing fewer other donors partially explain why donors are more likely to lapse after the occurrence of life events.

Exceeding previous research, we study the evolution over time of social gaps in achievement from birth to adolescence in Germany. Our theoretical framework juxtaposes two sets of compensation and polarization mechanisms which shape the overall extent of social inequality in learning as children navigate through early years and school. For Germany, with the most stratified education system in the Western world, our theoretical considerations predict that achievement gaps will be particularly magnified during tracked secondary schooling. We exploit data from 57 competence tests taken from age of 7 months to 16 years by the National Educational Panel Study. Composite skill measures and domain-specific skills were analyzed. Our findings point to striking socio-economic status (SES) gaps in skills which emerge and expand long before children enter school but then remain astoundingly stable throughout their school careers. We tentatively conclude that schooling decreases social inequality in learning.

We show that growing attention to new macroeconomic research was a reaction to both mounting external criticisms against the Fed’s decision-making process and a process internal to the discipline whereby institutionalism was displaced by neoclassical theory and econometrics. We argue that the rise of the number of PhD economists working at the Fed is a symptom rather than a cause of this transformation. 

Key to our story are a handful of economists from the Board of Governor’s Division of Research and Statistics (DRS) who paradoxically did not always held a PhD, but envisioned their role as going beyond mere data accumulation and got involved into large-scale macroeconometric model building. We conclude that the divide between PhD and non-PhD economists may not be fully relevant to understand both the shift in the type of economics practiced at the Fed and the uses of this knowledge in the decision making-process.

The streets of the nation’s capital have been flooded with people marching about a diversity of progressive issues including women’s rights, climate change, and gun violence.  Although research has found that these events have mobilized a high proportion of repeat participants who come out again-and-again, limited research has focused on understanding differential participation in protest, especially during one cycle of contention.  This paper, accordingly, explores the patterns among the protest participants to understand differential participation and what explains persistence in the Resistance.  In it, we analyze a unique dataset collected from surveys conducted with a random sample of protest participant at the largest protest events in Washington, DC since the inauguration of Donald Trump.

This paper draws on key insights from studies of the interdisciplinary process and proposes the Sharing Meanings Approach for improving interdisciplinary collaboration in hazards research. The Sharing Meanings Approach addresses common challenges to interdisciplinary teamwork and organizes them into four focal areas: (1) worldviews (including ontological, epistemological, and philosophical perspectives), (2) language, (3) research design, and (4) project goals. The approach emphasizes the process of sharing rather than seeking to develop a single set of shared meanings related to the four focal areas. The paper identifies common challenges and recommends strategies and actions within each focal area for guiding teams toward sharing their implicit meanings. A hypothetical example is introduced to demonstrate how the approach offers a path for revealing and overcoming the common roadblocks experienced in interdisciplinary hazards research. By making interdisciplinary hazards teams’ implicit assumptions explicit, the Sharing Meanings Approach offers an operational process to seize on moments of difference as productive tension and to see such challenges as opportunities—rather than obstacles—for innovating toward hybrid methodological research designs in hazards research.",TRUE,FALSE,disasters|epistemology|hazards|interdisciplinary|Sharing Meanings Approach,2018-09-28T22:14:21.545936,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-28T22:13:31.668433,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/citation/,hnf8y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nd5tk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/relationships/node/,nd5tk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5baea20f71746000164de99f/,5baea20f71746000164de99f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hnf8y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hnf8y,NA

Yet, if groups interact separately, they will each develop a specialized code. Using laboratory experiments, we compare the process of code emergence in transitive and cyclical triads. We find that transitive structures hinder dyadic coordination at the start, in particular for groups consisting of strangers. Our findings suggest that the coordination difficulties in transitive triads may be explained by the difficulty to establish a behavioral common ground due to the asymmetry of such structure. These coordination problems are transient - groups of different structures end up with the same average communication performance if given sufficient time. However, there remain lasting differences in the code: transitive groups of strangers are more likely than cyclical groups to have multiple dyadic codes, which are less efficient than group level codes.",TRUE,FALSE,communication codes|conceptual pacts|organizational codes|triads,2018-09-28T22:13:01.872563,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-28T22:12:20.939950,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/citation/,4w68c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6c4zr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/relationships/node/,6c4zr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bae72b671746000184d7c54/,5bae72b671746000184d7c54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4w68c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4w68c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4w68c,NA

Housing and utility costs consume the majority of many households’ monthly incomes. Consequences for missed payments include large fees, utility shutoffs, and evictions. Either hardship puts households at risk of losing adequate shelter. This study examines the prevalence and persistence of different combinations of housing and/or utility hardship using nationally representative panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). It also predicts transitions into these hardship combinations following commonly studied household dynamics: income changes, household composition changes, and poor health. Utility hardship is both more common and persistent than housing hardship, and households experiencing utility hardship have more disadvantaged characteristics. Entries into poor health are the strongest predictors of hardship. Other shocks predict one form of hardship more than the other. Most notably, income losses predict housing hardship but not utility hardship.",TRUE,FALSE,household dynamics|material hardship|poverty,2018-09-28T19:48:45.193834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-28T15:55:47.725156,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/citation/,gdft6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vzqm6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/relationships/node/,vzqm6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bae4d9b71746000154e4262/,5bae4d9b71746000154e4262,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdft6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gdft6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gdft6,https://doi.org/10.1177/0731121418782927
