Recommendations for Researchers Based on a Simulation Study,"Does X affect Y? Answering this question is particularly difficult if reverse causality is looming. Many social scientists turn to panel data to address such questions of causal ordering. Yet even in longitudinal analyses reverse causality threatens causal inference based on conventional panel models. Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags.",TRUE,FALSE,Causal Inference|Dynamic Panel Models|Exogeneity|Fixed Effects|Panel Data|Reverse Causality,2018-07-02T11:43:53.898733,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T12:18:15.292273,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Lars Leszczensky &amp; Tobias Wolbring,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/citation/,8xb4z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4h8nu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/relationships/node/,4h8nu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aafcfabfb9476000c2881e6/,5aafcfabfb9476000c2881e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xb4z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xb4z,NA

The data shows an overall free availability of 54.6%, with important differences at the country and subject category levels.

Between the surveys, randomly selected participants engaged with a virtual reality experience relating to the U.S.-Mexican border, and others read an article on the same topic.

Yet, we know little about the decision-making processes that lead to such outcomes. To address this gap, I conducted a longitudinal interview study of 21 heterosexual young adult couples who were deciding whether to move for early career opportunities. Analyzing 118 interviews, I detail how partners negotiate their desired work and family arrangements given structural and cultural constraints. On one negotiation trajectory, partners maintained their egalitarian desires by performing practical labor to make equal work–family arrangements. On another pathway, couples changed their desires by doing emotion work to justify neotraditional
roles. On the last pathway, men deferred to women’s desires, unintentionally leaving
women the emotional and practical work of coordinating two careers and the couple’s
life.

A high level of disagreement across and within government parties can lead to legislative stalemate and early dissolution of the parliament. This paper provides a new approach to capture legislative conflict dynamically across the electoral term. We use topic modelling and the scaling method Wordscores to estimate the disagreement across government parties in legislative debate over time. We analyse two German coalition governments that were faced with votes of confidence in 2001 and 2005, namely Chancellor Schröder’s cabinets composed of Social Democrats and Greens. We assume two specific policy areas (‘defence’ and  ‘labour market/social policy’) to be substantial in describing the main conflict lines that led to life-threatening government crises. Our findings suggest that analysing speech across the electoral term contributes to the understanding of inter-party conflict dynamics.

It concerns the interspaces where politics meets administration, towards the ""flows and interaction in multi-organisational contexts"". A study of processes in the overlap between the political intentions and their practical realisation, between political actions and everyday leadership. In this case the relationship between politicians, board administration and principals i. e. a triad.
An ethnography of a structure in a municipal within the educational/school area, primary and secondary level. Participant observation in two such triads in a larger municipal in southern Sweden over a year every week, most of the days in each week. And interviews during the process and at the end.
The study is composed of an active engagement from the participants in the study, being perceived as co-constructors in the research process. An interview does not merely become a ""collection of data"" with feed-back, but informants are parties in a knowledge-creation conversation, to a certain extent a reciprocal process.
This way of ""seeing"" leadership has not been studied frequently. Yet some researchers, have studied aspects of these triads and contributed with interpretations of use for this study. I make the assumption that it can be productive to see an actor's learning and creation of meaning in terms of ""hard data and evaluations"" and/or ""interactions and encounters"". In the triad, this actor is part of a system that comprises the other actors in the triad. A complex system of meaning-making processes is created, and research shows that it is the ""interaction""-dimension that dominates the work of leaders. This system can be understood in terms of relations, negotiations and loose-couplings as a manifestation of cultures. I suggest that leadership can be understood as ""The Art of Leading Others who Lead Themselves"". It is in that ""relationships"" politics and leadership are enacted.",TRUE,FALSE,Complexity|Leadership|Learning|Municipal cultures|Organizational sociology|Politics|Triads,2018-07-02T11:43:49.087865,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-15T12:55:36.690695,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d71|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/citation/,n2d3v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dfxgu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/relationships/node/,dfxgu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aaa1df46185de000e560a21/,5aaa1df46185de000e560a21,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n2d3v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n2d3v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n2d3v,NA

Notes on complexity and leadership in-situ,"In order to understand leadership, it is not enough to assume that organizations act as rational instruments. We need a better understanding of the dynamics of schools. Researchers have recently found that leadership's dynamism has a different meaning if we see organizations as complex systems and leaders in interacting and influencing. The purpose of this article is to discuss what leadership research has shown and what conclusions can be drawn. The starting point is research reviews, and evidence-based leadership, efficiency, problem-solving and methodology, leadership in complex organizations, practice-oriented leadership research and the relationship between leadership and learning. The article concludes, among other things, with a reflection on the school's scientific basis. One possibility may be to try to develop a ""science"" within the framework of their own activities in school and classrooms. Principals leadership is developed in practice and with inspiration from research, especially research that is practice-oriented. As shown in this article, the research provides different messages about what is successful. But we also need to use the studies that provide a deeper understanding of leadership dynamics and leadership aspects that have not been studied sufficiently.",TRUE,FALSE,Educational leadership|Leadership|Leadership as process|Managerial work,2018-07-02T11:43:49.044218,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-15T12:54:58.917045,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d71|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/citation/,cpd6k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ts2a6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/relationships/node/,ts2a6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aaa19257b3db9000fab15cd/,5aaa19257b3db9000fab15cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpd6k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cpd6k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cpd6k,NA
