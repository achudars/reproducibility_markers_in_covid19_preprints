We draw on the papers in this volume to describe those pressures and explore their consequences from an organizational standpoint. Building on the institutional logics perspective, field theories, world society theory, resource dependence, and organizational design scholarship, these papers show how the changing relationship between the state and higher education, cultural shifts, and broad trends toward globalization have led to financial pressures on universities and intensified competition among them. Universities have responded to these pressures by cutting costs, becoming more entrepreneurial, increasing administrative control, and expanding the use of rationalized tools for management. Collectively, these reactions are reshaping the field(s) of higher education and increasing stratification within and across institutions. While universities have thus far proven remarkably adaptive to these pressures, they may be reaching the limits of how much they can adapt without seriously compromising their underlying missions.",TRUE,FALSE,higher education|organizations|Preprint|review|socarxiv|universities,2018-07-02T10:45:14.327470,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-16T14:21:49.906000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/citation/,3wnzy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qd68a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/relationships/node/,qd68a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57dffcf5b83f6901ea9e253c/,57dffcf5b83f6901ea9e253c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wnzy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3wnzy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3wnzy,NA

However, prior scholarship generally assumes that the returns to education do not change over time or geographic space. Absolute educational effects are not always plausible; as more individuals obtain a college degree, there are a greater number of qualified individuals competing for the same social resources. The present study tests the impact of education on civic participation, and whether this effect changes as the number of college-educated individuals increases over birth cohorts. The present findings suggest that in some cases, a college degree's impact on civic participation declines as more individuals obtain college degrees. The findings challenge commonly held assumptions about the effect of higher education on civic participation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that while sending an individual to college may increase civic participation, encouraging all high school students to go to college may undercut the benefits of college attendance.

Prior research suggests that various job quality dimensions such as job security and individual task discretion affect subjective well-being, but the theoretical mechanisms are implied rather than tested and aspects of job quality are rarely tested together. I use structural equation modeling and General Social Survey data to assess the impact of five job quality dimensions-individual task discretion, monetary compensation, job security, low work intensity, and safe work conditions-on subjective well-being. Then, I show that job quality influences subjective well-being by improving social life, altering class identification, affecting physical health, and increased amount of leisure time. Finally, while I find that job quality dimensions do have statistically significant effects on subjective well-being, the way in which job quality affects subjective well-being differs by job dimension. In other words, job quality has a statistically significant impact on subjective well-being, but different job quality domains are connected to subjective well-being in different ways.

This article examines popularity, reputation, and social influence on Twitter using large-scale digital traces from 2009 to 2016. We process network information on more than 40 million users, calculating new global measures of reputation that build on the D-core decomposition and the bow-tie structure of the Twitter follower network. We integrate our measurements of popularity, reputation, and social influence to evaluate what keeps users active, what makes them more popular, and what determines their influence. We find that there is a range of values in which the risk of a user becoming inactive grows with popularity and reputation. Popularity in Twitter resembles a proportional growth process that is faster in its strongly connected component, and that can be accelerated by reputation when users are already popular. We find that social influence on Twitter is mainly related to popularity rather than reputation, but that this growth of influence with popularity is sublinear. The explanatory and predictive power of our method shows that global network metrics are better predictors of inactivity and social influence, calling for analyses that go beyond local metrics like the number of followers.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:34.055242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-13T16:25:12.378000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/citation/,9ve3x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cb73d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/relationships/node/,cb73d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d8286a594d9001ea7cd8a1/,57d8286a594d9001ea7cd8a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ve3x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ve3x,https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.151

ABSTRACT: By 2016, ongoing police shootings of unarmed black men had increased public awareness of policing processes; chief among those was militarization. Prior researchers explored this relatively new process, but very few had systematically analyzed it. In this paper, I conceptualize, operationalize, and describe police militarization across the United States. I transformed publicly available data, the Law Enforcement and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) dataset, into a panel of over 4,000 police departments over an eighteen-year period. I then constructed an index based on each of three dimensions of militarization: (1) increased stock of military equipment; (2) increased usage of paramilitary tactics; and (3) increased focus on military-style policing. I explain the indicators within each sub dimension, and describe their unique trend across time. Using both this Absolute LEMAS Militarization Index (ALMI) and a summary analysis of each indicator, I describe militarization between 1990 and 2007 using hierarchical linear modeling. Among key findings are three trends. First, I provide nationally representative evidence of an increasing trend in police militarization across most departments, despite statistical controls. I also found that larger departments were both more militarized and militarized faster over time than smaller departments. Finally, I found that diverse departments (either proportionately more women or more black officers) militarized at a slower rate over the period. This paper provides the theoretical and methodological basis for follow-up analyses of processes affecting militarization, including variations in crime control, organizational characteristics and racial dynamics.",TRUE,FALSE,Criminal Justice|Criminology|Hierarchical Linear Modeling|Law Enforcement|Militarization|Panel Dataset|Police|Policing|Preprint|socarxiv|United States of America,2018-07-02T10:51:11.238313,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-09T17:52:38.155000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/citation/,m7j3v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/586j3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/relationships/node/,586j3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d2f2a9594d9001fee9da9f/,57d2f2a9594d9001fee9da9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m7j3v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m7j3v,NA

effects of TMT structures, meaning the array of functional positions 
that TMT members fill.There are strong norms about TMT structures, so 
organizations that violate these norms may suffer.This is especially 
true for startups, which rely on their TMTs for legitimacy.Although many 
new organizations adopt TMT structures that are typical in their 
industry, others adopt more unusual structures.To study the effects of 
TMT structure unusualness, we build on theories of TMTs, legitimacy, and 
imprinting.We argue that organizations with more unusual TMT structures 
at startup suffer an /unusualness penalty/ and are more likely to fail, 
and that this unusualness penalty is stronger for specialists than 
generalists.We also argue that even if organizations amass experience 
with unusual TMT structures or their structures become less unusual, the 
unusualness penalty persists.To test these predictions, we analyze data 
on firms in one industry over five decades.The results generally support

with graduate training and research presences in fields outside the law 
– primarily in the social sciences, statistics, and the humanities, but 
also in biology and medicine – which has brought “interdisciplinarity” 
into law schools, in the form of scholarship under the banners of “law 
and [ ]” or “critical [ ] studies.” As their names suggest, these lines 
of inquiry either seek to extend traditional legal scholarship with 
complementary insights from external disciplines or else seek to 
question (if not overturn) traditional legal scholarship based on such 
insights. The rise of interdisciplinarity has been discussed in depth, 
with some scholars arguing that the rise of interdisciplinarity has 
strengthened the legal academy by broadening legal curricula and legal 
scholarship beyond traditional disciplinary law, while others aver that 
the rise of interdisciplinarity has reduced the autonomy of law in the 
university by introducing “alien” ideologies and practices. To trace 
this phenomenon, we use data-science methods to gather and analyze “big 
data” on the educational backgrounds of all faculty who held tenured and 
tenure-track positions in all accredited law schools in the United 
States in the 2011-12 academic year. Our analysis reveals a persistent 
increase in law-school faculty with PhDs, but most of those are faculty 
with both PhDs and JDs. This suggests that law schools have not been 
invaded by PhD-toting “pod people” importing alien values and practices 
from the arts and sciences Rather than reducing the autonomy of the law, 
the influx of PhD-trained faculty is more likely to be promoting an 
intellectual culture and academic practices that are a hybrid of the 
traditional legal academy and the arts and sciences, which involves 
taking only selected external elements and adapting them to fit 
traditional law-school culture and practices, rather than adopting them 
wholesale to replace traditional law-school culture and practices. Such 
hybridization would yield more of (almost) the same culture and 
practices. Our analysis also reveals that although PhD-trained faculty 
are concentrated in the most prestigious law schools, the influx of 
PhD-trained faculty has trickled down the ranks to many less prestigious 
schools. This suggests that PhD credentials have become an important 
axis of competition in the law school market, in which prospective law 
professors increasingly accumulate advanced degrees to compete for 
law-school positions, and law schools increasingly hire candidates with 
multiple advanced degrees to compete in prestige and media rankings. 
Finally, our analysis shows that male law professors are far more likely 
than their female counterparts to hold PhDs, but male professors are 
also far more likely than their female counterparts to be employed by 
top-tier law schools when they do not hold PhDs. The gender gap in the 
stratification of law faculty across the law-school prestige hierarchy 
indicates that even though the training of legal academics has changed, 
patterns of inequality in achievement have persisted.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:02.270720,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-08T19:04:46.388000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/citation/,y2zsk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n5mye/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/relationships/node/,n5mye,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d1b6509ad5a101e7eca5bf/,57d1b6509ad5a101e7eca5bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y2zsk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y2zsk,NA
