Variations in power exercised by state institutions at the local and national level have implications for the tactics that movements adopt. We examine the Right to Food Campaign in India, an informal network of organizations and individuals across local and national levels, which targets the state for entitlement to 
food. Using the interim orders of the Supreme Court in 2001, the campaign converted welfare initiatives for children into legal entitlements for access to nutritious food by holding state officials accountable at the local level; it also worked towards the enactment of the National Food Security Act of 2013. The campaign impacts local, national and global institutions, such as the WTO which expressed its disagreement with welfare provisions in the NFSA. 

Our analysis has three main implications. First, we note that the state is not a monolithic whole but comprises institutions at national and subnational levels (country, state, county or district, and village), all of which may not always work towards the same goal. Second, we argue that the state’s implementation of neoliberal policies that deny subsistence rights of the poor results in localized resistances that are linked to national and global protests. Third, a temporal lens on local and national politics is important to understanding the dynamics between local struggles and state institutions.

Although we agree that family processes are important, we think that these explanations downplay the structure of families (nuclear, extended) and thereby the ways in which gender relations are organized. In this paper, domestic violence is explored as an intra-family dynamic that extends beyond the intimate partner relationship and which seeps into court rulings of cases of such violence. 


Methodology/approach: Using archival data from 164 Supreme Court case decisions on domestic violence in India for the period 1995–2011, we examine both the patterns of conviction and the complexities of gender relations within the family by systematically coding the Court’s rulings. 

Findings :Analysis of court rulings show that mothers-in-law were convicted in 14% cases and the husband was convicted in 41% cases. We call attention to the collective nature of the domestic violence crime in India where mothers-in-law were seldom convicted alone (3% of cases) but were more likely to be convicted along with other members of the family. Two dominant themes we discuss are the gendered nature of familial relations beyond the intimate partner relationship and the pervasiveness of such gendered relationships from the natal home to the marital family making victims of domestic violence isolated and “homeless.” 

Research limitations/implication:Future research may benefit from using data in addition to the judgments to consider caste and class differences in the rulings. An intersectionality perspective may add to the understanding of the interpretation of the laws by the courts. 

Social implications: Insights from this paper have important policy implications. As discussed in the paper, the unintended support for violence from the natal family is an indication of their powerlessness and therefore further victimization through the law will not help. It is critical that natal families re-frame their powerlessness which is often derived from their status as families with daughters. Considering that most women in India turn to their natal families first for support when they face violence in their marriages, policy must enable such families to act and utilize the law. 

Originality/value : By examining court rulings on cases of domestic violence in India we focus on the power exerted by some women particularly within extended families which is central to understanding gender relations within institutions. These relations are legitimized by the courts in the ways they interpret the law and rule on cases.",TRUE,FALSE,Domestic Violence|Gender|India|Law|Violence,2018-07-02T10:47:33.760423,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-28T22:13:18.026000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/citation/,9qwfg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tbrby/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/relationships/node/,tbrby,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588b667b6c613b01f86adb79/,588b667b6c613b01f86adb79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9qwfg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9qwfg/,https://doi.org/10.1108/S1530-353520150000009003,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9qwfg

to Japan’s relationship vis à vis China, he was positing the idea that Japan should
hedge. Samuels identified a need for Japan to grow stronger whilst avoiding growing
sufficiently powerful as to pose a threat to China, while simultaneously positioning
itself not too close and not too far from the United States, its security guarantor. In
short, Japan should aim to get the relationship ‘just right’, hence the faerie—tale
analogy. Moving further south within Asia, an examination of the evolving
relationship between Vietnam and China shows this is precisely the strategy Vietnam
is adopting vis à vis China, albeit within an entirely different security dynamic. In
essence, Vietnam's hedging strategy, comprising what Goh has defined as a form of
“triangular politics” between Vietnam, China and the United States, is a strategy
predicated on working for the best whilst preparing for the worst. It is a strategy
that seeks to combine a mixture of balancing, containment, engagement and
enmeshment as a form of insurance against an uncertain strategic future.

This paper will argue that, due to Thayer’s “tyranny of geography’ – where
Vietnam's shared northern continental border and their long snaking eastern littoral
coastline bordering the South China Sea have inevitably thrown Vietnam's and
China's interests together – Vietnam is more threatened by China's rise than any
other regional state. As Goh states, “the tyranny of geography renders the two
countries strategic rivals.” Consequently, as China continues to rise, this paper
argues that Vietnam will increasingly seek to hedge with the United States,
increasing military and security ties with the western hegemon as part of a nuanced
strategy, which also includes engagement with China (particularly through growing
trade and economic ties); which seeks to enmesh China in multilateral institutions
within the regional security architecture; and which seeks to strengthen its own
security position through a program of military modernisation and selective military
expansion. This nuanced strategy we shall call hedging.",TRUE,FALSE,Asymmetric power relations|Bilateral relations|China|Hedging strategy|International Relations|Strategic studies|Vietnam,2018-07-02T10:53:46.883777,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-27T00:45:22.481000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/citation/,w8q7b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rdqg2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/relationships/node/,rdqg2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588a9627b83f6901eea69631/,588a9627b83f6901eea69631,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8q7b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8q7b/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8q7b

This body of work shows that wives are more likely than husbands to offer support to a depressed spouse. Moreover, when wives are depressed, they are more likely than husbands to try and shield their spouse from the stress of their own depression. Yet, previous research has not examined depression and relationship dynamics in gay and lesbian couples. We analyze in-depth interviews with 26 gay and lesbian couples (N = 52 individuals) in which one or both partners reported depression. We find evidence that dominant gender scripts are both upheld and challenged within gay and lesbian couples, providing important insight into how gender operates in relation to depression within same-sex contexts. Our results indicate that most gay and lesbian partners offer support to a depressed partner, yet lesbian couples tend to follow a unique pattern in that they provide support both as the non-depressed and depressed partner. Support around depression is sometimes viewed as improving the relationship, but if the support is intensive or rejected, it is often viewed as contributing to relationship strain. Support is also sometimes withdrawn by the non-depressed partner because of caregiver exhaustion or the perception that the support is unhelpful. This study points to the importance of considering depression within gay and lesbian relational contexts, revealing new ways support sustains and strains intimate partnerships. We emphasize the usefulness of deploying couple-level approaches to better understand depression in sexual minority populations.",TRUE,FALSE,depression|intimate relationships|LGBT|qualitative methods|romantic relationships|social support,2018-07-02T10:48:28.144527,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-26T16:55:09.580000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/citation/,cf8c2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bpmw3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/relationships/node/,bpmw3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/588a28ce594d9001f79fb3a2/,588a28ce594d9001f79fb3a2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cf8c2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cf8c2/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.048,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cf8c2

Yet investment in new parks can trigger housing price inflation through a process termed environmental gentrification. This can in turn potentially displace marginalized and vulnerable residents. In this chapter, we examine cases from Japan and Australia, investigating how informal urban greenspaces (IGS) (e.g. vacant lots, street or railway verges, brownfields, and power line corridors) could function as an ‘anti-gentrification’ urban greening strategy. Employing conceptual insights from political ecology and environmental justice, we use spatial and statistical analysis to test whether IGS is socio-spatially differentiated by (dis)advantage, and whether factors such as income and education affect residents’ perception and use of IGS. Results suggest that IGS holds considerable potential as a ‘just green enough’ intervention, because it does not appear to trigger gentrification as occurs with more ‘intentional’ green spaces. We argue that a key difference between intentional and informal greenspaces is the apparent empowerment of residents as co-creators, designers, managers and users of greenspace – not as passive consumers. Informal greenspaces may thus fulfill recreational needs while avoiding demands for a ‘return on investment’, a driver of environmental-gentrification. Insights from Japan suggest that planners and urban managers should identify and reduce IGS use barriers, provide better information (e.g. IGS maps), and work with residents to promote its use.",TRUE,FALSE,derelict land|eco-gentrification|environmental justice|participatory management|political ecology|urban agriculture,2018-07-02T10:51:42.365312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-26T01:27:41.902000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/citation/,mfa4w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4d463/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/relationships/node/,4d463,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58894e94594d9001fc9fb367/,58894e94594d9001fc9fb367,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mfa4w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mfa4w

Information dragnets increasingly yield huge quantities of individual-level data, which is analyzed to sort and slot people into categories of taste, riskiness, or worth. Developed to better understand and improve customer experience, these tools deepen the reach of the market and define new strategies of profit-making. We present a new theoretical framework for understanding them. We argue that (1) modern organizations follow an institutional data imperative to collect as much data as possible; (2) as a result of the analysis and use of this data individuals accrue ubercapital, a form of capital flowing from their positions as measured by various digital scoring and ranking methods; and, (3) the facticity of these scoring methods makes them organizational devices with powerful classifying effects. They offer firms new opportunities to structure and price offerings to consumers. For individuals, they create classification situations that identify shared life-chances in product and service markets.

Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as ‘open science’, these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology’s Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology,2018-07-02T10:46:30.004392,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-25T20:35:16.253000,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/citation/,72n8g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3d6xx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/relationships/node/,3d6xx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58890b92b83f6901f0a694ed/,58890b92b83f6901f0a694ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/72n8g/,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3D6XX,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/72n8g
