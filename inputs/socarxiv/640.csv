The last two decades have seen a growing trend towards the research of voting behavior in post-communist countries. Urban sociology theorists state that not only space structures influence political participation, but also space structures are changing under the influence of global, local, and individual factors. The growing role played by information in the global- ised world has accelerated the paradigm shift in urban sociology: from central place model (based on urban-rural distinction and on monocentric metropolitan areas) to network soci- ety (based on space of flows and polycentric metropolitan areas). However, recent studies have mainly focused on countries with solid democracies, rather than on former communist countries. The present study aims to analyze the extent to which a new emerging spatial structure can be envisaged within a metropolitan area of Romania and its consequences for the political dimensions of social capital.
Methods
The Transilvania University Ethics Commission approved this study (S1 Aprouval). The research is based upon individual and aggregate empirical data, collected from the areas adjacent to the core city in Brașov metropolitan area. Individual data has been collected during October 2012, using the oral survey technique (S1 Survey), based on a standardised questionnaire (stratified simple random sample, N = 600). The National Institute of Statistics and the Electoral Register provided the aggregate data per locality. Unvaried and multivariate analyses (hierarchical regression method) were conducted based on these data.
Results
Some dimensions of urbanism, identified as predictors of the political dimensions of social capital, suggest that the area under analysis has a predominantly monocentric character, where the rural-urban distinction continues to remain relevant. There are also arguments favoring the dissolution of the rural-urban distinction and the emergence of polycentric spa- tial structures. The presence of some influences related to the information consumption on all six indicators of the political dimensions of social capital under analysis suggests the occurrence of emerging forms of a space of flows. The identified effects of social problems associated with transport infrastructure and of migration experience on the political dimen- sions of social capital, also support the emergence of space of flows.
Conclusions
We recommend that, in the urban studies in former communist countries, conceptualization of urbanism as predictor of the political dimensions of social capital should consider both the material dimensions of space, as well as the dimensions of information consumption and migration experience.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet|migration|polycentric metropolitan areas|post-socialist|right to the city|space of flows|spatial structures|trust in politicians|urban sprawl|voter turnout,2018-07-02T11:29:50.647469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-16T23:04:46.105367,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/citation/,4awpq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hnat7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/relationships/node/,hnat7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a358f7b1e3f47000e86832d/,5a358f7b1e3f47000e86832d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4awpq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4awpq/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144485,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4awpq

A considerable amount of literature has been published based on the reflexive transformation of intimacy framework. This paper starts from the premise that, recently, more and more scholars have criticized the idea that detraditionalization and individualization led to the transformation of intimacy during reflexive modernity (late modernity). Critics question the ability of late modernity concepts to offer a cross- cultural and nuanced image of contemporary particularities of private life and intimate relations. The purpose of this study is to show the current state of knowledge in the social sciences on individualization thesis and detraditionalization thesis, the main theoretical criticisms of the two theses and conceptual alternatives to them. To achieve these goals, we conducted an interpretive synthesis of 16 articles from international literature, published between 1999-2014, in the thematic area of social changes brought by late modernity into the domain of private life and intimacy. In the Introduction section, we briefly present the two theses as reflected in the two of the most cited books on these themes: The Transformations of Intimacy. Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Societies (Giddens, 1992) and The Normal Chaos of Love (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 1995). In the body of the paper, we synthesize the arguments sustaining the criticism of the two theses and show some conceptual alternatives to these criticisms, as stated in the literature. In the concluding section, we resume the main arguments to open directions for future studies.",TRUE,FALSE,detraditionalization|emocratization of intimacy|individualization|pure relationship|therapeutic culture,2018-07-02T11:29:50.602513,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-16T23:03:55.731041,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,The Authors &amp; LUMEN Publishing House,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/citation/,y6dx2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yucjk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/relationships/node/,yucjk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a358d43bd7829001066a245/,5a358d43bd7829001066a245,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y6dx2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y6dx2/,https://doi.org/10.18662/po/2016.0701.03,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y6dx2

Informed by the market transition debate, stratification theories, and intergenerational mobility studies, this study aims to examine whether under the party-state political structure, ruling party membership is a substantial exogenous source of social class stratification. Data in this study is drawn from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (n = 2,209). The ordinary least square (OLS) regression suggests that for non-institutionalized Chinese adults who are born during the reform era (1978 -2013), their parents' Chinese Communist Party membership is a statistically significant factor in determining their social class measured by their income and education, when holding constant sex, age, region, urbanity, and ethnicity.

Understanding the Relationship Between Racial Residential Segregation and Self-Reported Health,"How does context influence health? County racial composition and racial residential segregation shape health outcomes by creating different contexts that influence access to health-related resources. White Americans disproportionately possess these material and intangible resources. Therefore, I propose that the higher the percent of non-Hispanic white residents in U.S. counties, and the higher the racial residential segregation in U.S. counties, the lower the percent of adult residents who report poor or fair health in U.S. counties. To explore these hypotheses, I analyze 2014 demographic and survey data from 2946 U.S. counties. Findings provide mixed support for my hypotheses. Percent white has a significant inverse relationship with county self-reported health. Controlling for median household income, access to health insurance and primary care physicians, and rurality, the higher the percent of white residents, the lower the percent of residents reporting poor or fair health in U.S. counties. However, the dissimilarity index has no significant relationship with the dependent variable. In both models, control variables of median household income, access to health insurance and primary care physicians, and rurality are significantly linked to self-reported health. These results suggest that the control and distribution of material (economic and political) and intangible (social and cultural) resources is key to predicting health outcomes. The concentration of resources in white communities is a critical aspect of maintaining structures of institutional racism. Changing the control and distribution of these resources will be key to overcoming widespread racial health disparities and other pervasive forms of structural racial inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,health|racial inequality|racial residential segregation|residential segregation|self-reported health,2018-07-02T11:29:50.339430,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-16T14:34:48.062291,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",Abigail Gramaglia,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/citation/,9hczw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/47kz2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/relationships/node/,47kz2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a351e9d1e3f47000f861f6f/,5a351e9d1e3f47000f861f6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9hczw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9hczw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9hczw

Most often sex education policies fall to the state government, resulting in vast differences in policy across the US. In this study I look at two different approaches to sex education: programs in which abstinence is stressed and programs that include information on contraception. Using the Guttmacher Institute’s evaluation of state sex education laws (2015) and The National Campaign to End Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy’s teen birthrates (2015), I have compiled a data set that allows a state-by-state analysis of sex education policies and teen birthrate outcomes. I have also considered the influence of the state’s political leaning on the variables by coding states that voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election as conservative. The findings suggest that controlling for sex education, conservative states have higher teen birthrates. While there appears to be a relationship between the type of sex education and teen birthrate, when conservative is controlled for the relationship disappears. Conservative states have higher teen birthrates than liberal states across all racial categories. Additionally, conservative states were more likely to stress abstinence in their sex education than include information on contraception. Finally, stressing abstinence in sex education has no effect on teen birthrates, while including information on contraception only has an effect on reducing the birthrate for Black teens. It appears that conservative politics may be a better indicator of teen birthrates than sex education requirements.",TRUE,FALSE,conservative politics|gender|sex education|sexuality|teen birth,2018-07-02T11:29:47.819213,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T21:37:22.393422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/citation/,hm3yj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xrk5t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/relationships/node/,xrk5t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3438c195de500011bdd013/,5a3438c195de500011bdd013,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hm3yj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hm3yj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hm3yj

Social media feeds are inundated with political content and are used by politicians and citizens alike to post political commentary. Neither mass media nor politics are new areas of study in sociology, but the entanglement of the two is proving to be of interest, as some scholarship argues that social media is driving changes in how politics works in the United States. We must consider how the citizenry consumes and processes political information in the modern era in view of the interplay between social media and current events. This study examines how membership and/or regular use of Facebook, and membership and/or regular use of Twitter affects perceived political understanding. I propose that, respectively, Facebook and Twitter use will increase perception of political understanding. Analysis of data from the 2016 General Social Survey reveals that Twitter membership and/or regular use is correlated with political understanding; meaning that those who use Twitter are more likely to believe they have an understanding of the political issues facing our country. The data confirms that the relationship between social media and political understanding must be taken seriously, and warrants deeper exploration. There is a need for future research that explores the kinds of content individuals consume on social media and the time they spend on these sites in order to develop a more robust understanding of exactly how social media use affects political understanding",TRUE,FALSE,Facebookbook|Political Understanding|Social Media|Twitter,2018-07-02T11:29:47.662645,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T18:51:15.908278,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/citation/,y4xts,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bc9nh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/relationships/node/,bc9nh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3400706f0d81000d8d4ffc/,5a3400706f0d81000d8d4ffc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4xts/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4xts/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4xts

However, few comprehensive and systematic reviews on the application of criminological theories in Asia have been conducted. Using a systematic quantitative literature review method on peer-reviewed English-language journal articles, we aim to provide an overview of the use of five major criminological theories in Asia: (1) strain; (2) social learning; (3) control; (4) routine activity; and (5) developmental and life-course. In particular, we address the following four questions: (1) how often are these theories tested in which region of Asia?; (2) what methodology is used to test these theories?; (3) to what extent are these theories supported in the Asian context?; and (4) what cultural uniqueness in the Asian context is taken into account in testing these theories, and what role and effect do they play in analysis and outcome? Findings indicate that the relationship between these theories and the Asian regions is skewed; many studies do not employ rigorous methodologies; these theories are either fully or partially supported in the Asian context; and only a few studies have analyzed the cultural uniqueness of the Asian context, and no effect of cultural uniqueness of the Asian context was found.

I draw on 13 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a welfare-to-work nonprofit that helps unemployed poor women through “style advice” and second-hand business attire. I examine organizational policies along with interactions between staff, volunteers, and clients to understand the extent to which – and how –cultural capital is transmitted to participants. I focus especially on the relationship between “objectified cultural capital” (professional attire, in this case) and clients’ “bodily capital,” which is bounded by the intersecting corporealities of gender, race, class, and body size. I find that, despite providing an essential service to women who need professional attire, the organization reproduces the inequalities it seeks to remedy through uneven distribution of objectified cultural capital, penalizing clients seen as “undeserving” and those with stigmatized embodiments. I use these findings to caution against romanticized understandings of philanthropic efforts to remedy social inequality, while also underscoring the importance of taking embodiment – particularly the striking social disadvantages of larger body size – into account when examining the intersections of gender, race and class.",TRUE,FALSE,Aesthetic Labor|bodily capital|body size|class|embodiment|ethnography|fat studies|gender|objectified body capital|race,2018-07-02T11:29:46.852797,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T04:54:42.207575,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Kjerstin Gruys,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/citation/,6hpcz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g6f87/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/relationships/node/,g6f87,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a331cfc0aeb750011934b5c/,5a331cfc0aeb750011934b5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6hpcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6hpcz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6hpcz

Social scientists have proposed a variety of explanations, including economic dissatisfaction, sexism, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. The current study establishes that, independent of these influences, voting for Trump was, at least for many Americans, a symbolic defense of the United States’ perceived Christian heritage. Data from a national probability sample of Americans surveyed soon after the 2016 election shows that greater adherence to Christian nationalist ideology was a robust predictor of voting for Trump, even after controlling for economic dissatisfaction, sexism, anti-black prejudice, anti-Muslim refugee attitudes, and anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as measures of religion, sociodemographics, and political identity more generally. These findings indicate that Christian nationalist ideology—although correlated with a variety of class-based, sexist, racist, and ethnocentric views—is not synonymous with, reducible to, or strictly epiphenomenal of such views. Rather, Christian nationalism operates as a unique and independent ideology that can influence political actions by calling forth a defense of mythological narratives about America’s distinctively Christian heritage and future.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 presidential election|Christianity|Christian nationalism|Donald Trump|Islamophobia|politics|religion|sexism|voting|xenophobia,2018-07-02T11:29:46.642489,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-15T04:53:20.538583,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/citation/,rdn98,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5mtsb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/relationships/node/,5mtsb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a32d3148b8e2d000ed7cc8b/,5a32d3148b8e2d000ed7cc8b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdn98/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rdn98/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rdn98

We argue that the social conditions in Northern Nigeria are fueling the growth of digital humanism which is also moving away from cyberactivism to become a full fledged cybersect.
