Women in professional occupations have greater access to workplace benefits which help reconcile work-family responsibilities and reduce non-employment spells. However, because of their higher earnings, women in professional occupations who re-enter after a break may experience significant earnings penalties. One strategy women employ to mitigate the earnings penalty is to delay childbearing. Here, I examine whether delayed fertility is positively associated with a reduced motherhood wage gap across 20 occupations. Using multilevel models and 2011-2015 American Community Survey data, I show that mothers in professional occupations experienced the largest earnings penalty with early motherhood, but also the largest premium with delayed childbearing. While delaying a first birth mitigates the earnings penalty in high-wage occupations requiring extensive career preparation, women in low-wage occupations experienced little economic benefit from older motherhood.",TRUE,FALSE,fertility|motherhood|occupations|wage gap,2018-07-02T11:48:11.465766,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-11T11:02:25.855411,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/citation/,vn7zt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bk2x4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/relationships/node/,bk2x4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5acd675cc7a6c0000ccf8454/,5acd675cc7a6c0000ccf8454,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vn7zt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vn7zt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vn7zt,NA

We test how asymmetric accumulation of wealth and debt between partners influences marital and cohabitation stability based on gender norms, economic independence, and financial strain perspectives. Using data from the 1996-2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we find support for the economic independence perspective as both female- and male wealth-dominant couples are at an increased risk of dissolution over wealth-homophilous couples. However, for married couples, female wealth-dominant couples are significantly less stable than male-dominant couples. For cohabiting couples, heterophily is less consequential and there is little difference between male and female-dominant couples.

Exclusionary Discipline and the Production of Delinquency,"There is growing concern that school discipline policies increase children’s risk of contact with the justice system, promoting a “school-to-prison pipeline.” Despite the popularity of this concern, the evidence of discipline’s impact on arrests remains limited in important ways. The current study leverages a unique combination of data sources to provide plausibly causal evidence that school suspensions mark a turning point in children’s lives, increasing their risk of later arrest. Combining fifteen years of data from the Fragile Families and Childhood Wellbeing Study with contextual data on neighborhoods and schools, I estimate that suspended children are two times more likely to experience an adolescent arrest than otherwise similar children. Although suspended children experienced significantly greater escalations in delinquency than their peers, post-suspension changes in behavior are unable to explain the association between childhood suspension and adolescent arrest. Instead, the data are consistent with a labeling theory of school sanctions, whereby suspended children face higher rates of subsequent discipline in ways that are largely unexplained by their reported behavior. At a time when juvenile arrests can permanently alter youth’s risks and opportunities, this study highlights an important mechanism by which schools shape inequality across the institutions that govern children’s lives.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:48:11.081294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-10T21:56:45.305535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/citation/,28qk4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/syue6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/relationships/node/,syue6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5accf936151710000f5d505c/,5accf936151710000f5d505c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28qk4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/28qk4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/28qk4,NA

To provide the first prospective evidence on sexual minorities’ early childhood peer victimization experiences and estimate the extent to which victimization histories explain adolescent mental health disparities.
Methods. Longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Childhood Wellbeing Study, a population-based cohort of children born in twenty American cities between 1998 and
2000, were used. Multivariate regression analyses examined peer victimization at ages 5,9 and 15 and anxiety/depression at 15. Teens reported sexual minority status during interviews conducted between 2014 and 2017.
Results. Compared to their peers, sexual minorities experienced similar rates of victimization at age 5 but higher rates ages 9 and 15. Over and above current bullying, prior victimization predicted worse outcomes on three clinically validated diagnostic scales for anxiety/depression. Results were consistent using parent and child reports. Despite sexual minorities’ elevated rates of bullying, only about 20% of their mental health disparities were explained by peer victimization.
Conclusions. Sexual minorities’ bullying risk begins years earlier than previously documented and persists into adolescence. Victimization prevalence estimates based on
adolescents’ recent experiences will substantially underestimate lifetime exposure to victimization.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:48:11.039593,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-10T21:55:39.255907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/citation/,rgm84,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kjv65/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/relationships/node/,kjv65,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5accf78a6a3691000f992913/,5accf78a6a3691000f992913,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rgm84/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rgm84/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rgm84,NA

This work-in-progress paper focuses on the content of Twitter messages related to the 2016 terrorist attack on the Berlin Christmas market. We chose topic modeling to investigate the Twitter data and the terror management theory perspective to understand why people used Twitter in the aftermath of the attack. In particular, by connecting people and providing a real-time communication channel, Twitter helps its users collectively negotiate their worldviews and re-establish self-esteem. We provide first results and discuss next steps.",TRUE,FALSE,social media|social networking sites|terrorist attacks|terror management|topic modeling|twitter,2018-07-02T11:48:10.364803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-10T21:53:12.977386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/citation/,964dc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d8kua/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/relationships/node/,d8kua,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5acc81d86a3691000f98bf99/,5acc81d86a3691000f98bf99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964dc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/964dc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/964dc,NA

They use their legislative repertoire to help them to cater to the interests of their principals. In this paper, we argue that we need to move beyond treating electoral systems as monolithic entities, as if all legislators operating under the same set of macro-rules shared the same set of incentives. Rather, we need to account for within-system variation, namely, candidate selection rules and individual electoral vulnerability. Using a most different systems design, we turn to Germany, Ireland, and Portugal to leverage both cross-system and within-system variation. We use an original dataset of 345.000 parliamentary questions. Findings show that candidate selection rules blur canonical electoral system boundaries. Electoral vulnerability has a similar effect in closed-list and mixed-systems, but not in preferential voting settings.",TRUE,FALSE,candidate selection|electoral systems|parliamentary questions|personal vote|representation,2018-07-02T11:48:10.327234,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-10T21:52:29.693850,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/citation/,ujgt7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3fcjw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/relationships/node/,3fcjw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5acc7f78151710000f5cd4d4/,5acc7f78151710000f5cd4d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujgt7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ujgt7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ujgt7,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12281
