Using a longitudinal, ethnographic study following students from elementary to middle school, we examine whether math homework can operate similarly. Because of inequalities in families’ resources for supporting homework, higher-SES students’ homework was more consistently complete and correct than lower-SES students’ homework. Teachers acknowledged these unequal homework production contexts. Yet, official policies treated homework as an individual endeavor, leading teachers to interpret and respond to homework in status-reinforcing ways. Students with consistently correct and complete homework were seen as responsible, capable, and motivated and rewarded with praise and opportunities. Other students were seen as irresponsible, incapable, and unmotivated; they were punished and docked points. These practices were status-enhancing for higher-SES students and status-degrading for lower-SES students.

This historical juncture is important to analyze because it constitutes a moment where collective anxieties become widespread and collective resources are mobilized to address them. Using market segmentation analysis, the purpose of the study is to produce a portrait of collective anxieties, paying special attention to the typical population segments in the Canadian population differentiated by their particular concerns about health and social conditions in the country and the world. The study used as its data source a survey sample of 4,600 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the confinement period of March 29 2020 to April 3 2020 and collected by Statistics Canada. Attitudinal domain items (12 in total) included concerns about personal and household health, the health system, the ability to cooperate and support during and after the crisis, family stress and others. A market segmentation analysis using Principal Components and k-means cluster analysis of these domain items revealed the presence of six major population segments: Health Conditions Anxious (13%), Health System Overload Anxious (26%), Angst-Free (23%), Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious (12%), Outer-Bubble Conditions Anxious (25%) and World Conditions Anxious (1%). The segment mottos were as follows: ""Glad I Have A Health Card!"", ""How Many Beds Do We Have?"", ""I'm Not Worried!, ""My Bubble May Be In Trouble!"", ""Other Bubbles May Be In Trouble! and ""It’s the End of the World As We Know It!”. Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious members displayed the higher average scores of collective anxiety and Angst-Free members, the lowest. Market segmentation is a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members by their typical attitudinal traits and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns, help design messages, and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with the various psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 confinement.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|Collective Anxieties|COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-11-12T15:17:40.945513,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T15:16:59.060790,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.fern2350.com/collective-anxieties-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-canada.html,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,Fernando Mata,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/citation/,sn9xu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fad3f6680ff8e00968d936f/,5fad3f6680ff8e00968d936f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sn9xu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sn9xu,NA

The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought into sharp focus the disproportionate effect that shocks and stresses have on already vulnerable people and places. This short communication aims to contribute to these debates by clarifying existing strengths and open issues for an evidence-driven response to climate change in Scotland’s marginalised communities. Growing support for rapid and radical climate action, both in Scotland and overseas, brings into question the role of learned societies and reasoned debate within a climate emergency. To this end, we synthesise recent Scotland-based research into issues relating to climate justice and, drawing on the outcomes of a workshop held in summer 2019, identify aspects where good progress has been made and areas where further work is required for an evidence-driven and just response to climate change in Scotland and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,climate emergency|climate justice|inequality,2020-11-12T13:12:22.264799,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T13:11:55.053662,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/citation/,bqkrp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fad3261efc18a009800e022/,5fad3261efc18a009800e022,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bqkrp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bqkrp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bqkrp,https://doi.org/10.1080/14702541.2020.1834335

We find that HBCU enrollment is associated with a 35% reduction in the odds of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HBCU attendees who grew up in more segregated environments experienced the greatest reductions in the likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome.

Specifically, it finds that that Irish-born immigrants were more likely to be employed in highly gender-segregated occupations than their German-born counterparts. This had a spatial impact on the residential patterns of Irish-born men and women. Because Irish-born immigrants tended to work in highly gender-segregated occupations that were located in different parts of the city, Irish-born men and women disproportionately lived in different areas. The paper discusses some of the historical and contextual factors that explain why Irish-born women were more likely than German-born women to go into highly gender-segregated occupations. Lastly, it shows how this relationship between occupational segregation and geography impacted the economic life cycles of these immigrant women. In particular, it identifies the rate at which women left the workforce after getting married or having children.",TRUE,FALSE,economic history|ethnicity|historical GIS|immigration|occupational segregation,2020-11-12T13:08:52.165217,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T13:06:57.973414,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History,Celia Arsen,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/citation/,s4jvz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fac615180ff8e00368d9388/,5fac615180ff8e00368d9388,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4jvz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s4jvz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s4jvz,NA

We first establish the role of the symbolisms and symbols in forming links among European citizens and in shaping a European identity.
We present a number of initiatives, which have been taken, aimed at forming a collective identity related to the concerns expressed in the recent years over the democratic deficit of the European Union. We consider Andonnino Reports especially significant in this sense through the recommendation of adopting Community symbols. After presenting other activities organized with this aim, in education, culture, and youth fields, we argue that the symbols established by the Constitutional Treaty are the most readily identifiable symbols of integration process.
We consider important to have a theoretical presentation of the social and anthropological functions of the symbols. The role of the national symbols of any state is to provide an identity, having at the same time a unifying and a federating power. We show the political implication of the symbols at the level of European citizens. The citizens can be influenced by means of symbols and their symbolisms, to leave aside their differences and act in the common public good. We can conclude that the first important steps to emerging European Union as a new post-national political system (where the national interest coincides with the European interest) have been made. We emphasize how the European symbols such as the flag, the anthem, the motto, the currency, and the Europe Day help to make the European Union more legitimate in the eyes of its citizens by creating emotive images and rites.
At the end of the paper, we describe the 9 May Day as a performance of a ritual festivity. We have in mind especially the capacity of this moment to act as a sequence of events within a fixed space and time and to involve simultaneously all stimuli. Our aim is to show how particular aspects of the process of construction of a European identity work in practice, in relation to the symbolic context of ideologies, images, and worldviews.",TRUE,FALSE,anthem|community|currency|European identity|European Union|Europe Day|flag|motto|symbols,2020-11-12T01:28:41.948017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T01:28:29.642319,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/citation/,fxuh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fac2d24efc18a001a007b7b/,5fac2d24efc18a001a007b7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxuh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxuh8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxuh8,NA

Since 25th March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in India due the COVID-19 pandemic has created an atmosphere of extreme uncertainty and raised several questions. Global analysts have already suggested that, for many developing countries, the economic consequences could be more crippling and devastating than the disease itself. Livelihoods are vital means of making a living. The terminology Livelihood is not synonymous to mere income generation. It encompasses people’s capabilities, assets and activities required to secure the necessities of life. Undoubtedly, globally COVID-19 has become an unprecedented shock; however, any kind of shock tends to reinforce the existing socio-economic-political and environmental stresses, problems and inequalities. Therefore, there is a need to understand how and to what extent this pandemic has affected and going to affect the lives and livelihoods of a coastal rural community entirely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, small-scale fisheries (inland and marine) and other riverine as well as forest resources for their subsistence. This paper attempts to explore the impact of COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown the livelihood choices and daily lives in the coastal rural stretches of Indian Sundarbans delta region. This study incorporates a telephonic rapid assessment survey method to understand the impact of COVID-19; for assessing the minute detailing and pathways of livelihoods, this paper refers to findings from a questionnaire-based household survey of the concerned area carried out by the author herself. The findings support the argument that the shock of COVID-19 will further aggravate the preexisting socioeconomic issues. The long withstanding local problems as well as backwardness and COVID-19 are mutually reinforcing in nature; the social cost and economic cost of this pandemic is immense. Asset loss, changes in dietary pattern and consumption, increased indebtedness, increased dependence on natural resources are some of the major findings.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Indian Sundarbans|Livelihood Diversity|Vulnerability,2020-11-12T01:28:22.026845,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T01:27:55.952374,FALSE,NA,no,Data was collected through primary survey by the researcher,,no,Mixed method was employed.
