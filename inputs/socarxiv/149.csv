Due to the lack of emphasis on vocabulary learning, ESL students have issues in learning the English language effectively, which resulted in low-level language proficiency. Hence, this paper attempts to address this problem by introducing Visual Vocabulary to learn the target words. The main research question: How effective is the use of the Visual Vocabulary to learn vocabulary for Form Two learners? To investigate the effectiveness of the use of the Visual Vocabulary, 60 students of Form Two from sub-urban schools in Ipoh and Teluk Intan, Perak, were selected. These students were instructed to learn a total of 45 target words and Visual Vocabulary was applied to assist them to learn and simultaneously understand the meaning of the target words. The independent sample t-test, paired sample t-test, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the scores of the pre and post-tests. The score comparison and total improvement score in percentage were also presented. The paired sample t-test results are (t=-17.85, df=29, p&lt;.05) for the experimental group and (t=-4.85, df=29, p&lt;.05) for the control group. Based on the stated results, both experimental and control groups improved significantly (p=.000*) in the post-test with a mean difference of 15.62. The results of this study confirm the effectiveness of Visual Vocabulary in learning and understanding the target words.

The present study utilized the quasi-experimental research design. The researcher divided the participants into two groups. The innovative group used strategic reading techniques, while the control group did not receive any training except for the regular method. The main question raised in this study was to what extent were the strategic reading techniques effective in improving reading skills for Jazan University students? To this end, the researcher collected data through a questionnaire and a strategic reading test. Furthermore, a model of teaching program, based on using strategic reading techniques, is improved and tested with a group of learners in the chosen university in Saudi Arabia. The findings revealed that the learners need an innovative strategy to help them improve their reading. The application of “clarifying, prediction, questioning, and summarizing” CPQS strategy as a pedagogy helped the learners improve their reading skills.

This approach can be seen as an adaptive movement to equip the learning process and the fourth industrial revolution. Nowadays, the demand of the technology-infused lesson is increasing as it is proven to help pupils learn the language better. Hence, this study explores multimedia learning as an approach to teaching reading comprehension. Besides, this study aims to answer two questions, which are the effectiveness of multimedia learning in helping indigenous pupils learn comprehension and which elements of media are effective in enhancing reading comprehension among indigenous pupils in Malaysia. Two instruments used to collect the data from 20 indigenous pupils in one primary school located in Kluang, Malaysia, and an action research design was used to achieve the purpose. The respondents were chosen through the judgment sampling technique. SPSS was used to analyse the data collected from the test, and thematic analysis was employed to analyse the semi-structured interview.

The main purpose of this study is to examine the developmental nature of Saudi intermediate school students' acquisition of spelling knowledge as measured by the Schlagal's Qualitative Spelling Inventory (designed to assess spelling error patterns). Further, it aims at determining whether Saudi intermediate school students' spelling performance improves as their grade level increases or decreases based on word-level complexity or difficulty. In fact, this study is significant since it reflects the progress of Saudi intermediate school students not only in spelling, but in other literacy areas such as reading, and listening. A strong parallel has been found between spelling, reading and listening. The sample of the study was 300 participants, all of whom were 7th and 9th male graders who study at intermediate public schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Spelling features and word spelling scoring scales were used to score the given data. The findings showed that the 7th-grade students were listed at the phonetic stage, while the 9th-grade students were listed at the patterns within words stage and syllable juncture stage.

These problems were mostly solved by: cooperating with other students, working with the tutoring center, asking advisers for help, and trying to get a scholarship from the government of Saudi Arabia.",TRUE,FALSE,higher education.|retention|Saudi students|student success,2020-07-20T05:18:01.756803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T05:17:47.776297,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://awej.org/index.php/volume-11-2020/99-awej-volume-11-number-2-june-2020/1741-graduate-students-perceptions-of-success-in-united-states-colleges,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/citation/,yn4ph,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1514606ef44000ebbca143/,5f1514606ef44000ebbca143,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn4ph/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yn4ph/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no2.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yn4ph

Through this paper, the author aims to tackle the status of foreign languages in the Algerian educational system and the extent to which English has been promoted on the expanse of French. Henceforth, the higher education reforms and their influence on the process of teaching/learning English as a foreign language. Mainly, this study intends to uncover the ideological inhibitions exercised by the government to model up a citizen meets the requirements that it needs but not the requirements of the 21st century.  More specifically, it exposes the trends of the Algerian decision-makers to maintain a position of a particular foreign language –French- over another foreign language, which is English among the Algerian speech community. This study will contribute to the reconsideration of the language policy of the government, the status of English as a foreign language, and the foreign language curricula. Yet, it bears a particular significance to the sociolinguistic situation in Algeria and its relationship to English as a foreign language context. It suggests the importance of promoting English to meet up the escalating waves of globalization.",TRUE,FALSE,foreign language curriculum|higher education reforms|ideology|linguistic history|the foreign language hidden curriculum.,2020-07-20T05:19:02.435494,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T05:18:43.301917,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://awej.org/index.php/volume-11-2020/99-awej-volume-11-number-2-june-2020/1740-the-linguistic-history-and-the-ideological-inhibitions-in-foreign-language-context-in-the-post-independence-algeria,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/citation/,ebcvf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f15136a0870f200e109bc62/,5f15136a0870f200e109bc62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebcvf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ebcvf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no2.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ebcvf

They focused upon the number asymmetry in different varieties in Arabic. Most linguists assert that in different types of Arabic there is always gender agreement between the subject and the verb. This study aims at giving much evidence for the lack of gender agreement in Modern Standard Arabic(MSA), and at accounting this gender asymmetry within the framework of the Minimality Program (Chomsky, 1995). The sample consists of 37 sentences collected from some Arabic textbooks. To analyze the data collected, a qualitative diagnostic research design was adopted. One of the essential findings of this study is that there is no gender agreement in Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) sentences between the postverbal subject and the verb if the subject is (a) an unreal feminine Noun Phrase (NP), (b) a broken plural NP, (c) an inanimate collective NP, (d) a collective NP, (e) a regular sound feminine plural NP, (f) an irregular sound feminine plural NP, (g) an irregular sound masculine plural NP, and (h) a real feminine NP separated from its verb by any category.  This study concludes that the head C in VSO sentences in MSA carries a weak gender feature represented as [-Strong]. Therefore, in VSO sentences, if the verb disagrees with its subject in gender, it will move from V to I and then to C because C is [-Strong]. A final conclusion is that the head I in VSO sentences in MSA carries a strong gender feature, represented as [+Strong]. Therefore, in VSO sentences, if the verb and its subject agree in gender, the verb will move from V to I; it will not move further.",TRUE,FALSE,gender asymmetry; minimality; head movement; weak and strong features,2020-07-20T05:18:40.919934,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T05:18:27.363392,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://awej.org/index.php/volume-11-2020/99-awej-volume-11-number-2-june-2020/1739-a-diagnostic-chomskian-view-to-arabic-asymmetry,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/citation/,2ryhq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1512760596f600de798e34/,5f1512760596f600de798e34,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ryhq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2ryhq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no2.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2ryhq
