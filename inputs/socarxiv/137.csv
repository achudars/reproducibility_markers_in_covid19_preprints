Understanding the relationship between populations at different scales plays an important role in many demographic analyses.
OBJECTIVE
We show that when a population can be partitioned into subgroups, the death rate for the entire population can be written as the weighted harmonic mean of the death rates in each subgroup, where the weights are given by the numbers of deaths in each subgroup. This decomposition can be generalized to other types of occurrence-exposure rate. Using different weights, the death rate for the entire population can also be expressed as an arithmetic mean of the death rates in each subgroup.
CONTRIBUTION
We use these relationships as a starting point for investigating how demographers can correctly aggregate rates across non-overlapping subgroups. Our analysis reveals conceptual links between classic demographic
models and length-biased sampling. To illustrate how the harmonic mean can suggest new interpretations of demographic relationships, we present as an application a new expression for the frailty of the dying, given a standard demographic frailty model.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-02T21:40:41.052173,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-02T21:39:02.851051,FALSE,NA,no,"The empirical examples use the United States Mortality Database (https://usa.mortality.org/).

more than 30,000 Americans over multiple waves to investigate whether WFH will stick, and why. Our data say that 20 percent of full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. We develop evidence on five reasons for this large shift: better-than-expected WFH experiences, new investments in physical and human capital that enable WFH, greatly diminished stigma associated with WFH, lingering concerns about crowds and contagion risks, and a pandemic-driven surge in technological innovations that support WFH. We also use our survey data to project three consequences: First, employees will enjoy large benefits from greater remote work, especially those with higher earnings. Second, the shift to WFH will directly reduce spending in major city centers by at least 5-10 percent relative to the pre-pandemic situation. Third, our data on employer plans and the relative productivity of WFH imply a 5 percent productivity boost in the post-pandemic economy due to re-optimized working arrangements. Only one-fifth of this productivity gain will show up in conventional productivity measures, because they do not capture the time savings from less commuting.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID|working-from-home,2020-12-02T21:41:42.359729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-02T21:39:23.893073,FALSE,NA,available,We hope to make the data publicly available in the coming months.,https://www.jmbarrero.com/s/WFH_Will_Stick_Code_and_Data.zip,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/citation/,wfdbe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc7d98c4269db012e1c3497/,5fc7d98c4269db012e1c3497,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wfdbe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wfdbe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wfdbe,NA

Comment on Yu et al.’s (2020) meta-analysis,"In their meta-analysis on how privacy concerns and perceived privacy risks are related to online disclosure intention and behavior, Yu et al. (2020) conclude that “the ‘privacy paradox’ phenomenon [...] exists in our research model” (p. 8). In this comment, we contest this conclusion and present evidence and arguments against it. We find three areas of problems: (1) flawed logic of hypothesis testing; (2) erroneous and implausible results; (3) questionable decision to use only the direct effect of privacy concerns on disclosure behavior as evidence in testing the privacy paradox. In light of these issues and to help guide future research, we propose a research agenda for the privacy paradox. We encourage researchers to (1) go beyond the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), (2) engage in open science practices, (3) refine theoretical explications, (4) consider confounding, mediating, and boundary variables, and (5) improve the rigor of causal inference. Overall, while we value this meta-analytic effort by Yu et al., we caution its readers that, contrary to the authors’ claim, it does not offer evidence in support of the privacy paradox.",TRUE,FALSE,comment|meta-analysis|meta-psychology|privacy|privacy concerns|privacy paradox|self-disclosure,2020-12-02T21:42:41.853971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-02T21:39:55.084260,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/8eamq/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/citation/,yxu5t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qexpf/,qexpf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc7a7e2aa60b801238936b5/,5fc7a7e2aa60b801238936b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxu5t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yxu5t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yxu5t,NA

The main reason for its increased popularity is that the UQR model seemingly tackles an issue with the traditional conditional quantile regression (CQR) model: the interpretation of coefficients as quantile treatment effects changes whenever control variables are included. However, the UQR model was not developed to solve this issue but to study influences on quantile values of the overall outcome distribution. This paper clarifies the crucial conceptual distinction between influences on overall distributions, which we term population-level influences, and individual-level quantile treatment effects. Further, we use data simulations to illustrate that various classes of quantile regression models may, in some instances, give entirely different conclusions (to different questions). The conceptual and empirical distinctions between various quantile regression models underline the need to match the correct quantile regression model to the specific research questions.

Mean contrasts, which compare categories to the overall mean, provide an alternative to the reference category, but the magnitude of mean contrasts is conflated with the relative sizes of the categories.

Consistent with firms seeking to avoid costly regulation, we document significant bunching around multiple regulatory thresholds introduced from 1992 to 2012. We present a revealed preference estimation strategy that uses this behavior to quantify regulatory costs. Our estimates show that various disclosure and internal governance rules leads to a total compliance cost of 4.3% of the market capitalization for a median U.S. public firm. We apply the estimated costs to firms’ public-private choice and show that regulatory costs significantly impact private firms’ decisions to go public, while have limited effects on public firms’ decisions to go private.",TRUE,FALSE,deregulation|disclosure|finance|governance|public-firms|regulation|SEC,2020-12-02T10:47:21.920418,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-02T10:46:31.554828,FALSE,NA,available,The main data is owned by S&amp;P Compustat.,https://github.com/michaelewens/public_float_regulation,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/citation/,pdv8n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc68ca86ebcc6009c46aa0c/,5fc68ca86ebcc6009c46aa0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pdv8n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pdv8n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pdv8n,NA

At least theory suggests. However, most research uses a uni-directional model. By conceiving the relationship as bi-directional it is possible to extend Pierson’s increasing returns theory to the neoliberal era, mostly after the 1980s, when welfare states of the rich democracies saw many forms of retrenchment. By testing a bi-directional theory using bi-directional models, this paper argues that public opinion likely updated in response to retrenchment and contributes to a new lock-in effect of institutionalized retrenchment paths. The models use ISSP data and a measure of the size of the welfare state based on SOCX spending data combined with a neoliberal indicator form the Fraser institute for the period 1990-2016 across the rich democracies for which data are available.",TRUE,FALSE,Increasing returns|Policy feedback|Policy preferences|Public opinion|Simultaneous feedback|Thermostatic feedback|Welfare state,2020-12-02T10:31:41.854485,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-02T10:31:09.763998,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/r3vj5/?view_only=a061ff7b00374f24882248cb2037ddbe,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/citation/,h8aqe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc65ea8aa60b80057898662/,5fc65ea8aa60b80057898662,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h8aqe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h8aqe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h8aqe,NA
