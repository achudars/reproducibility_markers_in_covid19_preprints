This position ignores the moral and material value attributed to literacy in upland folklore, as well as the many radical messianic movements that purported to bring writing back to the highlands. I review nine such cases of recuperated literacy among Southeast Asian minorities, all of which were created in circumstances of violent conflict with lowland states. Leaders of these movements recognised literacy as an important vehicle of state power but their appropriation of writing was limited to very specific purposes and domains. In short, the new literacy practices did not mirror its ordinary bureaucratic uses in lowland states.

Many scholars argue that transnational connections are the primary conduits for global cultural diffusion and, therefore, that affluent residents of the densely connected global core should be the most likely to identify with global society. However, empirical studies have shown that global identification is common on the global periphery. The authors build on theories suggesting that individuals may emphasize expansive identities when particularistic identities fail to provide a sense of security in the face of threat. They argue that members of peripheral and marginalized groups express greater global identification because of the threat inherent in their precarious social positions. The authors show that (1) global identification is more common among residents of weaker and more repressive states, (2) members of repressed minority groups are more likely to identify with global society than conationals with collective access to state power, and (3) many residents of one weak state—Lebanon—expressed greater enthusiasm for global connection immediately following a terrorist attack.",TRUE,FALSE,collective identity|global culture|group threat|terrorism|world citizens,2019-03-19T20:24:46.295805,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-19T20:24:01.766194,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Brandon Gorman and Charles Seguin,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/citation/,8pmfk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9107374712b400193c1071/,5c9107374712b400193c1071,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8pmfk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8pmfk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8pmfk,https://doi.org/10.1086/699652

This paper reports on an undergraduate class’s online discussion activities over one semester. Applying Social Network Analysis, this study revealed a participation gap among students reflected by their varied levels of network prestige. The low-prestige group initiated equivalent volumes of interactions but were less reciprocated. In-depth analysis found the high-prestige group also advantageous in other network measures such as closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality, as well as the strength, persistence, and reciprocity of their ties. To probe potential explanations of the revealed gap, we further contrasted post content and posting behaviors between two groups. Results did not identify any significant differences in post content but found low-prestige students’ participation less timely and more temporally compressed.

In these circumstances, inter-generational reproductive conflicts between younger and older females are predicted to resolve in favor of the younger females, who realize fewer inclusive fitness benefits from ceding reproduction to others. This conceptual model anticipates that immigrants to a community initially have few kin ties to others in the group, gradually showing greater relatedness to group members as they have descendants who remain with them in the group. We examine this prediction in a cross-cultural sample of communities, which vary in their sex-biased dispersal patterns and other aspects of social organization. Drawing on genealogical and demographic data, the analysis provides general but not comprehensive support for the prediction that average relatedness of immigrants to other group members increases as they age. In rare cases, natal members of the community also exhibit age-related increases in relatedness. We also find large variation in the proportion of female group members who are immigrants, beyond simple traditional considerations of patrilocality or matrilocality, which raises questions about the circumstances under which this hypothesis of female competition are met. We consider possible explanations for these heterogenous results, and we address methodological considerations that merit increased attention for research on kinship and reproductive conflict in human societies.",TRUE,FALSE,Descent|Dispersal|Kinship|Life History Theory|Reproductive Conflict|Residence,2019-03-19T14:22:44.701417,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-19T13:38:34.310433,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/citation/,xjb7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h8cqr/,h8cqr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8fbd404712b400183b30b4/,5c8fbd404712b400183b30b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xjb7c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xjb7c,NA

Others point out that local populations domesticate global cultural elements by integrating them into preexisting cultures, generating hybridized systems. In the current study, I argue that local cultures are not necessarily impediments to cultural change and hybridization is only one aspect of cultural domestication. Instead, I find that individuals attribute global norms to local cultural objects as a means for disassociating putatively universal norms from the powerful actors that dominate international politics. I illustrate this process using the case of support for shariʿa (sometimes called Islamic law) in majority‐Muslim countries. Results of multimethod analyses show that with the exception of attitudes about gender roles and sexuality, Muslims who support implementing shariʿa do not systematically object to many so‐called global norms; in fact, they may express more enthusiasm about democracy, tolerance for people of other religions, optimism about scientific advances, and concern for environmental preservation than those who oppose implementing shariʿa. Likewise, many Muslims assert their full participation in global society on terms not dictated by Western actors by repackaging ostensibly universal norms as components of the unambiguously local shariʿa.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural change|global society|local culture|MENA|shari'a|symbolic boundaries,2019-03-19T14:29:41.885455,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-19T13:40:33.340360,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology,Brandon Gorman,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/citation/,fmvpe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8fb30c4712b400183b25b8/,5c8fb30c4712b400183b25b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fmvpe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fmvpe,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12482
