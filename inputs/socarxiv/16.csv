Of particular interest is gentrification, which has been measured and mapped in fairly standard ways – even as its place in the broader public consciousness has grown rapidly. We argue that big data offers a new approach to the persistent problem of defining and measuring gentrification. Moreover, using big data also allows us to rethink broader questions about theory and methodological approaches in urban geography and GIScience. Using geotagged Twitter data as an indicator of social activity and connections, we demonstrate how the changing geographies of users’ tweets are proxies for the evolving social and spatial contours of urban neighborhoods. We use the case of Lexington, Kentucky and its gentrifying Northside to analyze the evolving mobilities and relational connections of neighborhood residents and visitors as gentrification intensified over time. We argue that these kinds of big data allow for an analytical approach that focuses on the dynamic, relational connections between people and places, and provides a useful, additional avenue in understanding a process as complex and multifaceted as gentrification.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|gentrification|Lexington|relational geography|social media|Twitter,2021-02-12T06:36:42.346857,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-12T06:36:04.177080,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/atepoorthuis/relationalgeographiesofgentrification,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/citation/,eq6vm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602575fd23238301919d95f1/,602575fd23238301919d95f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eq6vm/,https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2021.1888016,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eq6vm

A continuous method to providing quality teacher education curriculum content discloses the potential for teacher educators to produce high-quality teachers. Drawing on data from twenty teacher educators and sixteen student teachers in public institutions in Uganda, this article explored the perceptions of the teacher education curriculum content held by academic staff and student teachers in public Universities in Uganda. Using Pedagogical Content Knowledge Model as a tentative model of teacher preparation and Constructivism theory as an interpretive framework, the study was guided by one objective namely: (1) to analyze the perception of internal stakeholders about teacher education curriculum content offered in Makerere and Kyambogo Universities. This research adopted a qualitative, multiple case study design that was anchored in the interpretivist paradigm and directed by the social constructivism thinking. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews were participants from twenty teacher educators and sixteen student teachers who were purposively and conveniently selected. It was therefore concluded that both lecturers and student teachers viewed teacher education curriculum content positively viewing it as enabling learners to be equipped with specialized teaching skills, essentially directed towards teaching profession. Thus, recommendations to improve the stakeholder perception of the teacher education curriculum content are made and these include: teacher education curriculum review and the need to design a 21st-century teacher education curriculum by teacher trainers in corroboration with other university units rendering a training service to teacher trainees. This would bridge the gap of the disjointed teacher education curriculum content at Makerere and Kyambogo Universities hence strengthening the building blocks that produce a teacher.",TRUE,FALSE,Curriculum|Internal-Stakeholder|Pre-Service Teacher|Teacher Education,2021-02-12T06:35:41.891399,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-12T06:34:48.723000,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/citation/,ynpe4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6024e90dd6a432013ff0cf27/,6024e90dd6a432013ff0cf27,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ynpe4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ynpe4/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.175,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ynpe4

French is offered as a foreign language at the secondary and tertiary levels of education and has been introduced in some private primary schools.

One wonders how secure the future of French is in Uganda alongside the triumphant universal English language, the “national” flag bearer Kiswahili and the thunderous new arrival of Chinese.

It clearly specifies the ways intervention context and content combine to produce intervention outcomes. We report the development of initial programme theory for a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence-report tool (SRT). The SRT translates genome sequencing data to drive changes in the intensity and location of infection prevention and control (IPC) and related cleaning activities within UK NHS hospitals to reduce nosocomial infections. The SRT is being trialled within the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium Hospital-Onset COVID-19 study (HOCI). Within the HOCI study, we will assess the impact of the SRT, and its timing, when compared to no sequence data, on the occurrence and transmission location of nosocomial infection, reducing its incidence rate and identifying previously undetected nosocomial transmission. To develop the initial programme theory we used documentary analysis (e.g. trial protocol, case report forms, drafts of the SRT), informal discussions with trial team members, and the iterative development of logic models. The intervention’s causal mechanisms were conceptualised using combined insights from behavioural, implementation science and complex adaptive systems perspectives. Our initial programme theory will subsequently be used to shape a process evaluation within a diverse sample of trial sites.

Low response rates in qualitative surveys of researcher experience may reduce their usefulness. Various incentives to improve response rates have been proposed, but it is not known whether the chance of a single, large incentive is more effective than a greater chance of a smaller incentive.
Methods: We embedded a randomised controlled trial within the Edinburgh Research Culture Survey, comparing the effect on number of responses received of (1) a single reward of £1000 or (2) a reward of £50 for 1 in every 50 respondents, selected by random draw. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Edinburgh College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee. 
Results: The incentive offered had no effect on the number of responses received (odds ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.06]), but, having completed the survey, more participants entered the random draw in the £1000 incentive group (odds ratio 1.49 [1.16 to 1.92]). Staff were more likely to complete the survey, while students were more likely to enter the random draws. Most respondents provided answers to almost all of the survey items (IQR 171 to 172 or 175 items), and this did not differ between groups.
Conclusions: In this test of different incentives to increase survey participation, we observed no difference between a moderate chance of a modest reward and a small chance of a high reward. Those conducting such surveys can select their incentive system based on other factors such as cost.",TRUE,FALSE,incentive|online survey|randomised controlled trial,2021-02-10T18:22:02.884803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:21:13.472899,TRUE,None declared.

Revealing the Complementary Benefit of Cross-Skilling,"This work examines the economic benefits of learning a new skill from a different domain: cross-skilling. To assess this, a network of skills from the job profiles of 14,790 online freelancers is constructed. Based on this skill network, relationships between 3,480 different skills are revealed and marginal effects of learning a new skill can be calculated via workers’ wages. The results indicate that learning in-demand skills, such as popular programming languages, is beneficial in general, and that diverse skill sets tend to be profitable, too. However, the economic benefit of a new skill is individual, as it complements the existing skill bundle of each worker. As technological and social transformation is reshuffling jobs’ task profiles at a fast pace, the findings of this study help to clarify skill sets required for designing individual re-skilling pathways. This can help to increase employability and reduce labour market shortages.",TRUE,FALSE,Artificial Intelligence|Automation|Cross-Skilling|Labour Market|Online Labour Market,2021-02-10T18:22:22.258615,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:21:47.032252,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Fabian Stephany,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/citation/,sv9de,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6024002673c9fe010e075b4e/,6024002673c9fe010e075b4e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sv9de/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sv9de/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sv9de
