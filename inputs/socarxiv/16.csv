(1998) on Skepticism about MMR Vaccine Safety in the U.S.,"Background. Efforts to trace the rise of childhood vaccine safety concerns in the US often suggest Andrew Wakefield and colleagues’ retracted 1998 Lancet study (AW98) – which alleged that the MMR vaccine can cause children to develop autism – as a primary cause of US vaccine skepticism. However, a lack of public opinion data on MMR safety collected before/after AW98’s publication obscures whether anecdotal accounts are indicative of a potentially-causal effect. 

Methods. We address this problem using a regression discontinuity framework to study change in monthly MMR injury claims (N = 74,850; from 1990-2019) from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to proxy concern about vaccine safety. Additionally, we suggest a potential mechanism for the effect of AW98 on vaccine skepticism, via automated sentiment analyses of MMR-related news stories (N = 674; from 1996-2000) in major television and newspaper outlets. 

Results. AW98 led to an immediate increase of about 70 MMR injury claims cases per month, averaging across six estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 70.44 [52.19, 88.75], p &lt; 0.01).  Preliminary evidence suggests that the volume of negative media attention to MMR increased in the weeks following AW98’s publication, across four estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 9.59% [3.66, 15.51], p &lt; 0.01).

Conclusions. Vaccine skepticism increased following the publication of AW98, which was potentially made possible by increased negative media coverage of MMR. 

Significance. Childhood vaccine skepticism presents an important challenge to widespread vaccine uptake, and undermines support for pro-vaccine health policies. In addition to advancing our understanding of the previously-obscured origins of US vaccine skepticism, our work cautions that high-profile media attention to inaccurate scientific studies can undermine public confidence in vaccines.  We conclude by offering several recommendations that researchers and health communicators might consider to detect and address future threats to vaccine confidence.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-06T15:18:46.034713,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-06T15:17:54.161319,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/n7z2v/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/citation/,7wjb2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n7z2v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/relationships/node/,n7z2v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6093d41d6801ab04502a52af/,6093d41d6801ab04502a52af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7wjb2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7wjb2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7wjb2

Employing and further developing the concept of the informal Soviet empire, it discusses the structural adjustments in law and governance in the Soviet dependencies. The chapter outlines the development of the concepts of “people’s republic” and “people’s democracy” and discusses the process of adoption and the authorship of the constitutions. It then compares their texts with attention to sovereignty and political subjectivity, supreme state institutions, and the mentions of the Soviet Union, socialism, and ruling parties. Finally, it surveys the role of nonconstitutional institutions in political practices and their reflection in propaganda. The process of constitution-making followed the imperial logic of hierarchical yet heterogeneous governance, with multiple vernacular and Soviet actors partaking in drafting and adopting the constitutions. The texts ascribed sovereignty and political subjectivity to the people, the toilers, classes, nationalities, and regions, often in different combinations. Most of the constitutions established a parliamentary body as the supreme institution, disregarding separation of powers, and introduced a standing body to perform the supreme functions, including legislation, between parliamentary sessions, which became a key element in the legal adjustment. Some constitutions mentioned socialism, the Soviet Union, and the ruling parties. The standardization of governance in the informal Soviet empire manifested itself in the constitutional documents only partially. Propaganda and archival documents revealed the prominence of nonconstitutional institutions, parties and leaders, as well the involvement of Soviet representatives in state-building. Domestic parties and leaders in the Soviet dependencies were also presented as subordinate to their Soviet counterparts in propaganda.",TRUE,FALSE,constitution|empire|one-party regime|Soviet|state socialism,2021-05-06T02:28:03.028277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-05T22:20:51.122642,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3e|Law|Constitutional Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/citation/,2cy4b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6092e4165533b4040fe1ed75/,6092e4165533b4040fe1ed75,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2cy4b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2cy4b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2cy4b

This paper makes a first step in addressing this criticism by presenting arguments and discussion in favor of the importance of an interpretivist research philosophy for the domain of digital government.

Here, analyzing individual attitudes across 142 countries with a random forest model, I show that people in low-income countries are significantly more positive towards genetically modified food than those living in high-income countries. Globally, individual attitudes are primarily determined by living standard, agricultural output, and prevalence of undernourishment. Country income levels also moderate how demographic characteristics predict attitudes on bioengineered food. Highly educated urban men are most optimistic about agricultural biotechnology in high-income countries, while women, individuals living in rural areas, and those with little education are the most hopeful demographic in low-income countries.

This brief commentary introduces a policy problem, then shares 3 categories of successful case studies as possible solutions: [1] Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC): Vietnam and Iran, (3,4)  [2] public health practitioners: social workers in Africa and pharmacists in Zambia, (5,6) and [3] public health programs: a smoking cessation program and inmate health program. (7,8) Examples from LMIC were selected to demonstrate practical, cost-effective and duplicable methods. A collaborative multidisciplinary approach with community health partners is also proposed.

The authors analyze current COVID-19-specific black seed studies in the Middle East, South Asia, and the Far East. While black seed has benefits far beyond its antiviral and immunity-enhancing effects, the authors focus on the properties relating specifically to COVID-19. Since some of the countries discussed have fewer financial and human resources than the US, the successful ingestion or inhalation of black seed or black seed oil deserves worthy attention. This report is split into two sections, which explore (1) the Islamic, historical, botanical, and scientific significance of black seed; and (2) the chemical composition, nutritional values, and current use of black seed as a prophylactic and COVID-19 treatment. 
The authors intend to introduce black seed, a common ancient natural medicine that can be used to improve overall health and well-being, to key stakeholders in the Americas. Key stakeholders include researchers, policymakers, public health and preventive medicine clinicians and practitioners, and other persons concerned about a more equitable, economical, and accessible alternative, all-natural option for preventing and treating COVID-19. Black seed also serves as an introduction to Prophetic Medicine, a complementary practice used throughout the Muslim world alongside allopathic medicine. Implemented into one’s daily life, black seed has proven health implications surpassing the current COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,black seed|COVID-19|natural remedy,2021-05-06T03:08:03.002575,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-05T23:09:18.943187,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/citation/,athuc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6091af6419183d037a5537ed/,6091af6419183d037a5537ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/athuc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/athuc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/athuc

These interventions have positive results and seem to support true health and healing. In November 2020, Navarro et al10 published a paper regarding their promising on–⁠going clinical trial. The main aim of their study is to “evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet–⁠based adjuvant lifestyle–⁠based intervention for patients with TRD.”10 Since TRD can be exacerbated by stressors that have become more common due to the COVID–⁠19 pandemic, such as poor physical health and economic struggles, their study is an important one. Information and communications technologies and video conferencing will be used. The authors hypothesize that by the time of their 1–⁠year follow–⁠up, the lifestyle program group will show greater adherence and therefore benefits of the intervention. They said, “If this Internet–⁠based multimodal lifestyle intervention program is useful as an adjunct to the pharmacological treatment of depression, this approach should be considered for the management of patients with TRD in similar emergency situations.”10 This study is not only promising because of its novel approach to treating TRD, but also because this intervention may be duplicated and used almost anywhere in the world and at any time, even times of emergency. The idea that TRD could be successfully treated by combining lifestyle medicine with modern–⁠day technology rather than by administering drugs is hopeful.",TRUE,FALSE,depression|lifestyle medicine|religion health|trd|treatment resistant depression,2021-05-06T03:10:03.068044,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-05T23:09:55.177011,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Pain Management,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/citation/,xy9mj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6091a9886801ab03812acb02/,6091a9886801ab03812acb02,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xy9mj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xy9mj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xy9mj
