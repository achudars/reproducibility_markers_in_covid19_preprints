Recent research in genopolitics and neuroscience, however, suggests that this conviction is partially unwarranted given that biological and genetic factors explain more variance in political attitudes than choice and environmental factors. Thus, it is worth exploring whether exposure to this research on the biological and genetic basis of political attitudes might influence levels of affective polarization because such exposure might reduce the perceived moral culpability of partisan outgroups for the endorsement of oppositional beliefs. In this paper, I employ an online survey experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 487) to assess whether exposure to research on the genetic and biological etiology of political attitudes influences warmth toward partisan outgroups and preferences over political compromise. I present evidence that nontrivial numbers of participants in the treatment group reject the underlying science and do not update their genetic trait attributions for political attitudes. However, I also find that when the treatment is successful at increasing biological and genetic trait attributions, exposure to this research depolarizes strong-identifying partisans. Moreover, as partisans increasingly endorse biological and genetic trait attributions for political attitudes, they increasingly hold favorable attitudes toward political outgroups. These patterns suggest a potentially profitable inroad for political polarization interventions going forward.",TRUE,FALSE,affective polarization|experiment|genopolitics|polarization|political science|survey,2020-04-25T00:45:50.316932,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:45:25.083602,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,Alexander William Severson,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/citation/,7qgcr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea20cd1de5e0c000efccc73/,5ea20cd1de5e0c000efccc73,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qgcr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7qgcr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7qgcr,NA

Many scholars have emphasized the economic roots of radical right support. Other scholarship highlights the role of the urban-rural divide, contending that the radical right finds support in low population density locations due to distinctive social values and strong place-based social identities found in rural areas. To date, however, we do not have a full grasp of the sources of these latter factors nor an understanding of the historical roots that explain their emergence. We argue that what is frequently classified as the ``rural'' bases of radical right support in previous research is in part a proxy for something entirely different: communities that were in the historical ""periphery"" in the center-periphery conflicts that shaped modern nation-state formation. Inspired by a classic state-building literature that emphasizes the prevalence of a ``wealth of tongues'' (Weber 1976)---or nonstandard linguistic dialects in a region---as a definition of the periphery, we use data from more than 725,000 geo-coded responses in a linguistic survey in Germany to show that voters from historically peripheral geographic communities are more likely to vote for the radical right today.",TRUE,FALSE,AfD|dialect|locality|nationalism|parochialism|place-based identity|radical right|voting,2020-04-25T00:42:41.964388,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:42:27.512874,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/citation/,syr84,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea1f29cc74184001df3e545/,5ea1f29cc74184001df3e545,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/syr84/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/syr84/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/syr84,NA

Popular Resistance against Children’s Rights and Juvenile Justice in Contemporary Russia,"Since the mid-2000s, Russia has increased its efforts to strengthen the legal rights of children and to improve the systems of social assistance to vulnerable families in in line with the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child. The reform drive has met fierce resistance by a grassroots mobilization in defence of ‘traditional Russian family values’. Child rights are conceived of as weapons in a Western moral war against Russia, but simultaneously, the popular appeal of the campaign stems from a profound distrust in Russian state administrators, who purportedly use the CRC for personal gain. This paper suggests that this disbelief makes the protesters locate notions of citizenship primarily to the intimate social sphere, prioritizing ‘parental rights’ rather than ‘civil rights’ defined by the state-citizen relationship. It is also suggested that the confidence of citizens in their own state administration must be considered if the Convention is to be successfully implemented.",TRUE,FALSE,Child rights|corporal punishment|family values|juvenile justice|nationalism|Russia|social policy|UNCRC,2020-04-25T00:44:17.654041,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:43:36.128603,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/citation/,5md7u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea16137fe323800d8c3853e/,5ea16137fe323800d8c3853e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5md7u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5md7u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5md7u,https://doi.org/10.1163/15718182-02404007

The Impact of International Cooperation on Capital Taxation,"The downward trend in capital taxes since the 1980s has recently reversed for personal capital income. At the same time, it continued for corporate profits. Why have these tax rates di-verged after a long period of parallel decline? We argue that the answer lies in different levels of change in the fights against tax evasion and tax avoidance. The fight against evasion by households progressed significantly since 2009, culminating in the multilateral adoption of automatic exchange of information (AEI). In contrast, international efforts against base ero-sion and profit shifting (BEPS) failed to curb tax avoidance by corporations. We theorize that international cooperation is an intervening variable, countering the negative impact of tax competition on capital taxation by reducing the risk of capital flight. Under such conditions, domestic political pressures in favor of higher capital taxes can unfold. We confirm our argu-ment in a difference-in-difference analysis and through additional tests with data for up to 35 OECD countries from 2000-2017. Our central estimate suggests that the average tax rate on dividends in 2017 is 4.5 percentage points higher than it would have been absent international tax cooperation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-04-25T00:41:41.455605,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:41:21.620888,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/citation/,tvneu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea0b35635f4bf00a91f8f51/,5ea0b35635f4bf00a91f8f51,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tvneu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tvneu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tvneu,https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1752769

Although some prior studies have investigated race differences in parental college savings, none have taken an intersectional approach, and most of these studies were conducted with cohorts of students who pre-date key demographic changes among U.S. college-goers (such as the reversal of the gender gap in college completion). Drawing on theories of parental investment and data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), we show that both race and gender are associated with whether parents save for college, as well as how much they save. Both Black boys and Black girls experience savings disadvantages relative to their White peers. However, particularly striking disparities face Black girls: Black girls with the strongest academic credentials receive savings equivalent to those with the weakest academic credentials. Results suggest that this in due, at least in part, to the fact that high-achieving Black girls tend to come from families that are much less well-off than high achievers in other race-gender groups. As a result, parents of Black girls frequently rely on funding sources other than their own earnings or savings to pay for their children’s college. These include private loans that may pose financial challenges for Black girls and their families across generations, thus deepening inequalities along the lines of gender, race, and class.

Governors have issued stay-at-home orders, and prosecutors have filed criminal charges against individuals for defying those orders. And yet, many Americans have still refused to keep their distance from their fellow citizens, even if they had symptoms of infection. This study explores the underlying causes for those who intend to defy these norms.
Methods: Using national-level data from a March 2020 survey of 989 Americans, we explore intentions to defy social distancing norms by testing an interactionist theory of foundation-based moral behavior in combination with faith in President Trump.  The analysis controls for a range of variables, including measures of low self-control and deterrence. 
Results: Low self-control is the strongest predictor of defiance intentions. Consistent with interactionist theory, defiance intentions are significantly higher for those holding a specific faith in Trump and those endorsing binding foundation.  Furthermore, the interaction of these two variables is significant and in the predicted direction. The results hold for two different measures of faith in Trump. 
Conclusions: Even with a strong effect for low self-control, faith in President Trump is a strong predictor of refusal to social distance, and its effect is largest among individuals high in binding foundations.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|moral foundations|pandemic|President Trump|social distancing,2020-04-25T00:39:43.730539,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:39:19.325460,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/citation/,fudzq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea059579fd598007956f12e/,5ea059579fd598007956f12e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fudzq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fudzq,NA

We explored this idea by examining the impact of excess mortality linked to the COVID-19 crisis on life expectancy in the region of Madrid (Spain). Using data from the Daily Mortality Surveillance System (MoMo), we calculated excess mortality (death counts) for the weeks 10th to 14th in 2020 using data on expected and observed mortality, assuming no further excess mortality during the rest of the year.

A Case Study on the Regulation of Uber in New York,"Platform companies like Uber not only disrupt existing markets but also contest existing regulatory regimes. This raises the question of how, when, and why such companies are regulated. This paper develops, tests and defends a theoretical framework that explains the politics of regulatory response to the rise of platform capitalism. Using discourse network analysis and a case study on the regulation of Uber in New York, it shows that the success or failure of regulations depends on the ability of actors to mobilize broad coalition; that narratives affect the composition of these coalitions; and that platform companies have both unique political strengths and vulnerabilities. The paper makes substantive contributions to our understanding of the politics of platform capitalism, and it makes theoretical contributions to the literatures on coalitional politics, ideational institutionalism, and business power.",TRUE,FALSE,Business Power|Coalitional Politics|Discourse Network Analysis|Framing|Narratives|Platform Capitalism|Sentiment Analysis,2020-04-23T05:03:00.809908,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-22T12:14:41.842149,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dec|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Transportation",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/citation/,up9qz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9f63359fd598004f568973/,5e9f63359fd598004f568973,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/up9qz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/up9qz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/up9qz,NA

The rapid uptake of the label, the article concludes, was the result of the Ford Foundation’s 1951 decision to name its social science unit the “Behavioral Sciences Program” (BSP). With Ford’s en- couragement, the term was widely adopted by quantitative social scientists eager to tap the founda- tion’s social science funds.
