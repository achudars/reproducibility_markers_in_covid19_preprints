For instance, young bioengineers have developed 3D-printed personal protective equipment and ventilators to serve as inexpensive supplies to combat the malignancies of the disease.

To describe the methodology and baseline cohort characteristics of the COVID-19
Coping Study, a longitudinal mixed-methods study of US adults aged ≥55.
Methods
Participants were recruited through online multi-frame non-probability sampling in April
and May, 2020. The baseline questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on
daily life and mental health. Monthly follow-ups will be conducted for one year.
Findings
In total, 6,938 adults participated across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and
Puerto Rico (mean [SD] age: 67.3 [7.9]; 64% female). Two in three adults reported
leaving home only for essential purposes in the past week (population-weighted
proportion: 69%; 95% CI: 68%-71%). One-quarter of older adults in work before the
pandemic reported reduced work hours or income (25%; 95% CI: 22%-27%). One in
three screened positive for depression (32%; 95% CI: 30%-34%) and anxiety (29%;
95% CI: 28%-31%).
Conclusions
We observed substantial self-reported effects of COVID-19 on daily life and prevalent
mental health symptoms in this cohort.

Migrants were surveyed online and recruited into the sample through Facebook advertising. MOBILISE also conducted online surveys of the national populations of Argentina and Ukraine. This report explains why MOBILISE choose to recruit the sample through Facebook advertisements and provides detailed information on the set-up of the sampling. It also present an overview of the effectiveness of this method, in terms of costs, reach and bias, and of issues encountered. We find that sampling through Facebook advertisements is a cost-effective way to obtaining a large sample.

Over the past 30 years, Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) have steadily pressured buyers to make sustainability improvements in their supply chains. Yet, literally billions of dollars, and many attempts at new environmental standards, codes, monitoring, and capacity building programs have failed to drive significant progress in environmental performance. Against this pessimistic backdrop, an 11-year old initiative—the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC)—has developed the leading strategy to drive sustainability within the global apparel industry. Its major initiative has been the Higg Index: a suite of six data tools. The Facility Environment Module (FEM), now in version 3.0, is the annual assessment of an apparel facility’s environmental management capabilities, procedures, and plans. This report is the output of a four-year analysis of the implementation and effectiveness of the FEM v2.0. This report analyzes whether the standards, measurement, verification, and learning processes advanced through the FEM improve the environmental performance of the apparel industry. The study covers quantitative data analysis of all FEM v2.0 data, a survey of a select sample of facilities, and case studies of eight facilities in Bangladesh and China. Our overall conclusion is that the FEM is having foundational, but not transformative impacts as it still lacks critical incentives to change factory practices.

We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal owners’ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. 
Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. 
Results: Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. 
Conclusion: The human-animal bond is a construct of potential clinical importance to identify mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Animal ownership appeared to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of lockdown.

Evidence from Panel Data,"Volunteering is an activity in which individuals work for free to benefit others; however, research has also focused on the benefits volunteers themselves might experience. We add to the literature by focusing on how not only volunteering itself has an impact on wages but how the intensity, duration and timing of volunteering also have an effect on these. In addition, we distinguish between the effects on volunteers in the same job and when changing a job, and test the role of social capital. Using German data from the Socio-Economic Panel, we find that current volunteering has positive effects on wages in a fixed effects wage regression, especially if individuals volunteer with low to medium intensity. The duration of volunteering does not increase wages. However, based on the dummy impact function, we find that volunteering increases wages almost immediately and that this effect remains fairly constant over time. We find no indication that reverse causality drives this effect. Furthermore, we show that the wage benefits of volunteering are realized only through job changes, not on-the-job wage progression. With regard to job changers, we show that social capital accumulation through volunteering is one reason explaining the observed wage effects.",TRUE,FALSE,panel data|social capital|Volunteering|wages,2020-08-01T17:34:02.635242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-01T17:33:42.040630,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/citation/,j7fhx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f22b0cd5f705a004061e098/,5f22b0cd5f705a004061e098,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j7fhx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j7fhx/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001699320902809,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j7fhx

Dieser Beitrag geht der Frage nach, ob die sozialen Netzwerke von Arbeitslosen deren Chancen zur Aufnahme einer Erwerbstätigkeit positiv beeinflussen. Ausgehend von in der aktuellen Literatur diskutierten Wirkmechanismen werden mehrere Hypothesen zu unterschiedlichen Aspekten des Netzwerks aufgestellt. Es wird angenommen, dass Arbeitslose umso eher in Arbeit kommen, je größer der Umfang ihrer (starken und schwachen) sozialen Beziehungen ist, je mehr Kontakt zu Erwerbstätigen sie haben und je mehr Ressourcen ihr Netzwerk enthält. Auf Basis des Panels „Arbeitsmarkt und soziale Sicherung“ mit dem Schwerpunktmodul zu sozialem Kapital werden diese Hypothesen anhand einer Fixed-Effects Panelregression getestet. Wird für alle zeitkonstanten so-wie für einschlägige zeitvariante Variablen kontrolliert, erweisen sich schwache Beziehungen, gemessen als aktive Mitgliedschaften in freiwilligen Vereinigungen, sowie der Umfang nicht unmittelbar auf die Stellensuche bezogener sozialer Ressourcen als bedeutsam für die Arbeitsmarktchancen. Der Beitrag endet mit einer Diskussion dieser Befunde. 


This paper examines whether the social networks of unemployed people have a positive impact on their re-employment chances. Hypotheses are derived from the literature, concerning different aspects of the network. We hypothesize that the more (strong and weak) social ties, the more em-ployed friends the unemployed have and the more resources there are in their network, the higher their chances for re-employment. We use data from the Panel Study “Labour Market and Social Security” (Panel “Arbeitsmarkt und soziale Sicherung”), where comprehensive information on the unemployed persons’ networks is available. We use fixed-effects regression to control for observed time-variant and unobserved time-invariant confounders. We find weak ties in the form of active memberships in voluntary organisations as well as network resources that are not directly related to job search to be significantly related to re-employment. The implications of this finding are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,Fixed-Effects Panel Regression|Job-Finding|Long-Term Unemployment|Social Capital|Social Networks,2020-07-30T11:46:52.511784,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-30T11:46:23.679614,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://www.iab.de/de/daten/replikationen.aspx,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/citation/,dc7wf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f22ad2cb084f60048c99122/,5f22ad2cb084f60048c99122,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc7wf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dc7wf/,https://doi.org/10.1515/zfsoz-2019-0025,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dc7wf

Focus linguistique sur les tweets francophones de Belgique,"The Covid-19 health crisis of 2020 strongly affected the international community. Especially during the lockdown period, social media were widely used for information and emotion sharing. This article aims to keep a material trace of these crisis communication trends. To reach this aim, we applied quantitative and qualitative methods on a corpus of 100,000 tweets we collected in the French-speaking part of Belgium. The corpus is divided into three sub-groups: citizens, politicians and the media. We first present the corpus collection and the methodology we followed. We also look at the lexical creativity that resulted from the crisis and the lockdown situation. We then propose a semantic approach of the themes that emerged from the crisis tweets and which highlight citizens’ concerns. Finally, we depict the personalities related to the crisis, by focusing on their communication and on the image they portray to the public.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|crisis communication|linguistics|twitter,2020-07-30T09:20:05.582859,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-30T09:19:41.372375,FALSE,NA,no,Only available for researchers.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/citation/,3qrcw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g6nqe/,g6nqe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f228961b084f6003ec9a78e/,5f228961b084f6003ec9a78e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qrcw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3qrcw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3qrcw
