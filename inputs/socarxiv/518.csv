These widening class gaps are significant because parental investment is one pathway by which advantage is transmitted across generations. Using over three decades of micro-data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the American Heritage Time Use Survey linked to state-year measures of income inequality, we test the relationship between income inequality and class gaps in parental investment. We find robust evidence of wider class gaps in parental financial investments in children—but not parental time investments in children—when state-level income inequality is higher. We explore mechanisms that may drive the relationship between rising income inequality and widening class gaps in parental financial investments in children. This relationship is partially explained by the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution in state-years with higher inequality, which gives higher-earning households more money to spend on financial investments in children. In addition, we find evidence for contextual effects of higher income inequality that reshape parental preferences toward financial investment in children differentially by class.",TRUE,FALSE,family|inequality|parenting,2018-07-02T11:53:25.783670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-21T22:32:40.411088,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/citation/,7gjdc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/628ku/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/relationships/node/,628ku,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b031b55e9cb340010b3ddd6/,5b031b55e9cb340010b3ddd6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7gjdc/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122418772034,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7gjdc

Indeed, Penny Dreadful is offered as a warning of a darker age to come. Accordingly, writer John Logan sets his series in a late Victorian, Gothicized London that serves as a microcosm for a contemporary Western world experiencing a psychological and spiritual disintegration that touches the individual and the larger culture. Logan calls attention to the anxieties generated by this disintegration by incorporating into his series characters from late Victorian Gothic fiction: Frankenstein and his creature, Dracula, the Wolf Man, Dorian Gray, and Dr. Jekyll. The individual and cultural anxieties suggested by these characters’ “monstrous” behaviors have their basis not only in their sexual dysfunctions but in their despair over God’s absence. This crisis is centered in sexually adventurous Vanessa Ives, whose attempts to return to the Christ Who has rejected her hold the series together. In the series’ final episode, just before her death, Vanessa has a vision of Jesus. In response to Vanessa’s death, most of the remaining characters are seized by an ennui that has its counterpart in our own culture. The suggestion is that Logan uses Vanessa Ives as a symbolic representation of a dying world view, which, somewhat ironically, provided for her remaining friends a hope that sustained them.",TRUE,FALSE,Gothic|John Logan|Media|Penny Dreadful|Television|TV,2018-07-02T11:53:24.565022,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-21T22:37:03.673468,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c90|Arts and Humanities|Television,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/citation/,g6ez4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h4ybt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/relationships/node/,h4ybt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b027640a556d0001306f4df/,5b027640a556d0001306f4df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ez4/,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/H4YBT,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ez4

As a predominantly rural country (with 80% of land used for agriculture), rural planning policy is a key modifier of Manx cultural landscapes. Manx vernacular farmhouses, cottages, and farm buildings, alongside Manx sod hedges and small field structure, contribute to the ‘sense of place’. Current policy only allows for rural development in exceptional circumstances, which includes ‘replacement dwellings’, a policy mandating the clearance of existing rural development. There has been to date no assessment of the effectiveness of Manx planning policies at protecting built heritage within cultural landscapes. I created an evidence-based methodology with decision-trees to assess: (a) the completeness of policy implementation; and (b) its influence on decision-making. The method is demonstrated for the ‘replacement dwelling’ policy for the last 3.5 years. Public records were screened for relevance, with those remaining assigned policy assessment, compliance, and policy balance scores. Of 62 relevant applications, 58 had recommendations contrary to ‘replacement dwelling’ policy. In total, 50% of the replacement dwelling requirements were assessed by case officers in the applications. In particular, requirements establishing the principle of demolition / redevelopment (including protection for existing historic buildings) were only assessed with 23% completeness, and 14% compliance. 27 applications permitted demolition and replacement of vernacular buildings, including 17 farmhouses. Assessments of historic and architectural merit, required by policy, were uncommon, and only once was a conservation report obtained. The requirements for siting, size, and design of approved replacements were complied with 47% of the time, with 38% of these deemed ‘exceptional circumstances’. The evidence strongly suggests that policy application is inconsistent and incomplete, with the policies assessed here having no relation to the recommendations issued. Policy thus fails to provide protection to the historic buildings.

In doing so, particular economic shocks are framed within the disasters literature for the first time. The institutional shift from corporate pensions to individual retirement accounts since the 1980’s changed the social and economic logics of retirement, making this financial location salient, where shocks to the stock market reveal a distinct pattern of economic action. Using the 401(k) retirement account data, I show that bear market years in 2002 and 2008 caused retirement savers to orient their portfolios toward durable conservatism – a finding that deviates from predictions made by either neoclassical or behavioral economic theory. Rather, a sociological mechanism developed in the disasters literature – the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) – provides a plausible explanation for the empirical findings. Interestingly, the practical rule of conservation that works well for many disaster scenarios, for retirement savers creates an unfortunate discrepancy between the objective chances of retirement security and the subjective aspirations of 401(k) savers by causing underinvestment in stocks that can produce suboptimal portfolio returns manifesting itself as latent retirement inequality, especially impacting the youngest savers who have the most at stake.",TRUE,FALSE,disasters|economic sociology|retirement|risk|social amplification of risk,2018-07-02T11:53:22.346077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-20T03:30:43.827231,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Adam Hayes,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/citation/,fxgms,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kpcfd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/relationships/node/,kpcfd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b004102a556d0001405ca25/,5b004102a556d0001405ca25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxgms/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxgms

We show that opposition to stricter gun control is closely linked to Christian nationalism, a religious cultural framework that mandates a symbiotic relationship between Christianity and civil society. Using data from a national population-based survey, we show that Christian nationalism is an exceptionally strong predictor of opposition to the federal government enacting stricter gun laws. In fact, of all the variables we considered only general political orientation has more predictive power than Christian nationalism. We propose that the gun control debate is complicated by deeply held moral and religious schemas that discussions focused solely on rational public safety calculations do not sufficiently address. For the substantial proportion of American society who are Christian nationalists, gun rights are God-given and sacred. Consequently, attempts to reform existing gun laws must attend to the deeper cultural and religious identities that undergird Americans’ beliefs about gun control.",TRUE,FALSE,Christian nationalism|gun control|guns|religion|United States,2018-07-02T11:53:09.931580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-18T17:57:49.952370,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/citation/,3ag7k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/geuzq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/relationships/node/,geuzq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aff045d365b68000f571725/,5aff045d365b68000f571725,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3ag7k/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023118790189,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3ag7k

But culture does not spread like a virus. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation which we refer to as associative diffusion. Drawing on two insights from research in cognition—that meaning inheres in cognitive associations between concepts, and that such perceived associations constrain people’s actions—we propose a model wherein, rather than beliefs or behaviors per-se, the things being transmitted between individuals are perceptions about what beliefs or behaviors are compatible with one another. Conventional contagion models require an assumption of network segregation to explain cultural variation. In contrast, we demonstrate that the endogenous emergence of cultural differentiation can be entirely attributable to social cognition and does not necessitate a clustered social network or a preexisting
division into groups.

It carries significant weight as urban planners and engineers site transportation infrastructure and utilities, plan for disaster recovery, and assess urban vitality. Various methods with various drawbacks exist to estimate daytime population density across a metropolitan area, such as using census data, travel diaries, GPS traces, or publicly available payroll data. This study estimates the San Francisco Bay Area's tract-level daytime population density from US Census and LEHD LODES data. Estimated daytime densities are substantially more concentrated than corresponding nighttime population densities, reflecting regional land use patterns. We conclude with a discussion of biases, limitations, and implications of this methodology.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|California|cartography|census|data science|daytime density|density|disaster planning|GIS|infrastructure|land use|LEHD|livability|LODES|mapping|payroll|population|regional studies|San Francisco Bay Area|spatial analysis|transportation|urban planning|visualization|vitality,2018-07-02T11:53:08.601376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-18T10:44:19.694054,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/citation/,ybvzu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/znmc9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/relationships/node/,znmc9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afdd54bee2b5f000f453d17/,5afdd54bee2b5f000f453d17,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybvzu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ybvzu/,https://doi.org/10.1080/21681376.2018.1455535,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ybvzu

Such evidence is unreliable and if accepted uncritically may result in the spreading of inaccurate information and the perpetuation of myths that distort our knowledge of the past and ultimately obfuscate future research.  Indeed, most histories of the investigations at Cheddar Gorge have been simple uncritical narratives that fail to evaluate the veracity of sources of information as well as the quality of the archaeological information obtained. Therefore, to verify the claims of archaeological discoveries in Cheddar Gorge, the aims of this paper are to undertake a historiographical analysis of archaeological studies and excavation reports and to undertake a resource assessment of the actual archaeology recovered and recorded. This paper, therefore, not only demonstrates that historical documents can provide archaeologically relevant information about past investigations at Cheddar Gorge, but also outlines a more relevant, verifiable, and unbiased history for use by current and future researchers.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeological Resource|Bronze Age|Cheddar Gorge|Historiography|Lithics|Mesolithic|Neolithic|Palaeolithic,2018-07-02T11:53:08.236683,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-17T17:57:20.042326,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/citation/,xp6uw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/56djw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/relationships/node/,56djw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afd828193d197000f2f435b/,5afd828193d197000f2f435b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp6uw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xp6uw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xp6uw
