Despite claims that the subprime mortgage crisis helped fuel recent political turmoil in the U.S., we lack systematic empirical evidence about the effects of this unprecedented spike in home foreclosures on American elections. We combine nationwide deed-level public records data on home foreclosures with election data and administrative voter data to examine the effects of home foreclosures on electoral outcomes and on individual voter turnout.  At the aggregate level, county-level difference-in-differences estimates show that counties that suffered larger increases in foreclosures did not punish or reward members of the incumbent president's party more than less affected counties.  At the individual level, merging the Ohio voter file with foreclosure data, difference-in-differences estimates reveal that Ohioans whose homes were foreclosed on were somewhat less likely to turn out to vote, particularly when foreclosures occurred close to election day.  The findings cast doubt on the claim that individual-level economic distress during the Great Recession directly activated angry voters, and raise questions about the posited causal link between economic distress and the electoral punishment of incumbents.",TRUE,FALSE,economic voting|foreclosures|great recession|retrospective voting|trump,2018-07-02T10:55:49.297689,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-13T15:23:48.529985,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/citation/,9ptqc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jmnts/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/relationships/node/,jmnts,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58ef970f6c613b024e3773ba/,58ef970f6c613b024e3773ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ptqc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ptqc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ptqc,NA

However, the magnitude of the gender gap varies significantly by country, ranging from 2 to 20 hours per week in this study. Using data from the 2002 International Social Survey Programme, this article investigates whether work-hour regulations have a significant effect on household allocation of paid labour and gender work-hour inequality. Two main types of work-hour regulations are examined: standard weekly work hours and the maximum allowable weekly work hours. Results show that households in countries with shorter maximum weekly work hours had less work-hour inequality between spouses, as each additional allowable overtime hour over the standard workweek increased the work-hour gap between couples by 20 minutes. These results indicate that couples’ inequality in work hours and gender inequality in labour supply are associated with country-level work-hour regulations.",TRUE,FALSE,employment|family policy|gender|work hours,2018-07-02T10:55:48.543294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-10T15:46:06.164528,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Liana Christin Landivar,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/citation/,xbwnj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8436p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/relationships/node/,8436p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58eba7fa594d90024f0b4125/,58eba7fa594d90024f0b4125,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbwnj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbwnj,https://doi.org/10.1177/0950017014568139

An Occupational Assessment of Women’s Employment","After decades of growth, women’s labor force participation stagnated in the 2000s, prompting widespread interest in work-family balance and opting out. However, much of the research and media attention is limited to small samples of women in managerial and professional occupations. Using data from the 2009 American Community Survey, this study examines mothers’ labor force participation and work hours across 92 occupations to assess whether mothers in non-managerial and non-professional occupations exhibit similar work patterns. I find that mothers in managerial and professional occupations are the least likely to remain out of the labor force but most likely to work reduced hours. The results indicate that there is significant occupational variation in women’s work-family strategies, and these comparisons provide insight into the differential structures of disadvantage that encourage different work-family outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|mothers|occupations|opting out|women's employment|work|work hours,2018-07-02T10:55:48.513184,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-10T15:27:12.022927,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Liana Christin Landivar,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/citation/,sx7wm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/27m3f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/relationships/node/,27m3f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58eba2e0b83f690250b8b5b5/,58eba2e0b83f690250b8b5b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sx7wm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sx7wm,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12075

The Communicative Approach promised rapid results in English language learning, however concerns have been voiced on a perceived decline in students’ performance in writing proficiency, following the shift in focus to communication (Lakhwe, 2016; Maalouf,2016). Thirty years after its implementation, calls were made to reevaluate the Communicative Approach based on case studies and results from ELL contexts (Bacha, 2016; Samra, 2016). Arguments provided that what may work in native contexts may not have the same impact in non-native learning contexts (Lakhwe 2016, Ghadi, Biddou and Boukanouf 2016). This case study seeks to identify the main tenets of the Communicative Approach in non-native contexts, and to recommend essential components to its application. The study is based on data collected from 198 students doing English communication skills courses and 45 participating English tutors in an English foreign language (EFL)university context, Lebanon.

Learners are different from each other and this difference matters in learner-centred instruction. This work is an attempt to identify the students’ learning-style and brain-dominance profiles at the Department of English, Larbi Ben M’hidi University, Oum el Bouaghi, Algeria. Seventy two Master Two-level students took part in this study. The Barsch Learning-Style Inventory and the Brain-Dominance Inventory were used as data collection tools. The results show that most of the participants have a visual mode of learning, whether predominantly or in combination with the auditory mode.

It was observed that students in Moroccan high schools are generally not able to speak their minds out freely and imaginatively in English. This paper studies the causes for students’ weak speaking skills in the English language and suggests solutions to mend the situation. An observation of the teaching and learning practices took place in a sample Moroccan high school and interviews as well as questionnaires were administered for the aim of tracing the obstacles students face in their learning process as well as their preferences that they wish to have applied in the speaking sessions. Several speaking activities were tested and proved effective in encouraging students to speak English in class and defeat their shyness and reluctance to express their opinions. These activities are provided in this paper for teachers to use starting from common core classes passing by 1st year Baccalaureate( Bac )and ending with 2nd year Bac (common core being the first year of high school in Morocco and so on) and include watching films and conducting projects in the framework of a cooperative learning.

Audiences lump similar producer into categories in order to facilitate their search process, so that producers who do not fit into one specific category -- or who span multiple categories -- are penalized relative to their single category peers. I present an alternative model of the world in which producers in a market segregate into categories but without any reliance on an audience process: instead categorical boundaries reflect producers' best efforts to explore a complicated marketplace given their limited information about what audiences demand. Categories emerge as a cross-sectional consequence of a dynamic exploration process: At any given time, the world features a mix of high-performing producers within categorical clusters and low-performing producers outside or between them. But spanning positions are more likely to be occupied by entrepreneurial producers, and future categorical clusters emerge from their efforts to explore the terrain. As such any apparent category spanning discount is nothing more than the consequence of bad luck in the process of taking risk.

This concern has two forms. The first arises if the binary model is treated as an estimate of a model for an unobserved continuous response, and the second when models are compared between groups which have different distributions of other causes of the binary response. We argue that these concerns are usually  misplaced. The first of them is only relevant if the  unobserved continuous response is really the subject of substantive interest. If it is, the problem should be addressed through better measurement of this response. The second concern refers to a situation which is  unavoidable but unproblematic, in that causal effects and descriptive associations are inherently group-dependent and can be compared as long as they are correctly estimated.",TRUE,FALSE,Average treatment effects|Latent variables|Logit models|Probit models|Regression modeling,2018-07-02T10:55:47.527142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-07T12:29:07.765832,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/citation/,gwck3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/95zym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/relationships/node/,95zym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e783f2b83f69024f4ff3a7/,58e783f2b83f69024f4ff3a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwck3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gwck3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gwck3,NA

While some scholars have documented Congress’ racist past, less is known about the present significance of race in the federal legislature. Throughout the day, African Americans routinely nod to one another in the halls of the Capitol, and consider the Black nod as a common cultural gesture.  However, data from over sixty in-depth interviews suggest there is an additional layer of meaning to the Black nod in Congress. From the microlevel encounters, I observed and examined, I interpret the nod as more than a gesture that occurs in a matter of seconds between colleagues or even among perfect strangers in the halls of Congress. The Black nod encompasses and is shaped by labor organized along racial lines, a history of racial subordination, and powerful perceptions of race in the post-Civil-Rights era on the meso-, and macrolevels. Using this interpretive foundation, this article will show how the nod is an adaptive strategy of Black staffers that renders them visible in an environment where they feel socially invisible. The nod becomes an external expression of their racialized professional identity. I argue that the congressional workplace is a raced political institution and that the microlevel encounters I observed delineate and reproduce its racial boundaries. This article represents perhaps the first sociological study of Congress and provides an unprecedented view into its inner workings and the social dimensions that organize workplace relationships.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptive Strategy|Black Nod|Boundary Work|Congress|Cultural Repertoires|Social Invisibility,2018-07-02T10:55:10.019654,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T18:00:53.448020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity", Hutchins Center for African and African American Research,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/citation/,vhp6m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e7zfd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/relationships/node/,e7zfd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e6810a594d90024e92d5d5/,58e6810a594d90024e92d5d5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhp6m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vhp6m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhp6m,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742058X16000369
