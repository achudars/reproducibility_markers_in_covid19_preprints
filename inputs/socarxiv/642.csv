The Dynamics and Distribution of Language Populations,"Scholars have conjectured that the return to speaking a language increases with the number of speakers. Long-run economic and political integration would accentuate this advantage, increasing the population share of the largest languages. I show that, to the contrary, language size and growth are uncorrelated except for very small languages (&lt;35,000 speakers). I develop a model of local language coordination over a network. The steady-state distribution of language sizes follows a power law and precisely fits the empirical size distribution of languages with ≥35,000 speakers.

Several institutional developments including the rise of business accelerators, angel groups, and startup competitions, have meant that founders seeking this type of capital increasingly pitch their business ideas to investors in group settings, raising the question of whether the order in which ideas are pitched affects outcomes. Research on order effects in other competitive environments indicates that judges often have high expectations and calibrate their evaluations to the lower average performance of competitors at the beginning of competition, making it difficult for those going early to do as well as those performing later. We test empirically whether this calibration effect is also present for efforts by founders to pitch investors by conducting a field experiment.

I find that dictators treat marginal earned and windfall income as partially infungible, supporting mental accounting. Dictators who had a single income source gave 14% of a marginal windfall token and 5% of a marginal earned token. Strikingly, dictators who had income from both sources were sharply less generous with each, giving only 2% and 1%, respectively. Multiple accounts enabled greater selfishness at the margin.

By the 1930s publications were appearing by GSA and EFEO officials that indicated a cultural chronology from the Late Pleistocene (Tam Hang - Arambourg and Fromaget, 1938) through to the late Holocene (The Plain of Jars - Colani, 1932). The history of these early French archaeologists has been well described elsewhere (Malleret, 1969, Saurin, 1971, White and Bouasisengpaseuth, 2008), here we will concentrate on how that work, and more recent research, has added to our current understanding of the origins, behavior, and identities of the prehistoric human populations of Laos, as well as their biological, linguistic and cultural diversity and commonalities.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|Laos|Southeast Asia,2018-07-02T11:28:50.968161,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-13T14:51:56.049764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/citation/,75zhc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dtrj3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/relationships/node/,dtrj3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3084870f8f53000e48d3cc/,5a3084870f8f53000e48d3cc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75zhc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75zhc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75zhc

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we tracked families from 5 years before child with ND birth until the child reached 20 years of age and used latent growth curve modeling to estimate different trajectories for risk of two indicators: poverty and economic hardship. In bivariate terms, families raising a child with ND had higher risks of poverty and economic hardship across time. Five latent growth trajectories were identified for each indicator. After controlling for family and caregiver characteristics that preceded the birth of the child with an ND, families raising a child with a ND were more likely to experience persistent economic hardship. However, raising a child with a ND was not associated with a unique poverty risk, suggesting that families already in poverty are more likely to remain poor if they have a child with a ND. The study establishes descriptive evidence for how having a child with a ND relates to changes in family economic conditions. The importance of social and economic conditions that precede the child’s birth lend support for a social causation framework of health inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,disability|economic hardship|neurodisability|poverty,2018-07-02T11:28:50.837779,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-13T14:51:14.136951,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/citation/,mh8zg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/398qj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/relationships/node/,398qj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3035a60f8f5300114857e5/,5a3035a60f8f5300114857e5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mh8zg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mh8zg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mh8zg

Racial Residential Segregation and Educational Attainment,"Is racial residential segregation or integration a stronger predictor of educational attainment? Does the racialized direction of this relationship matter? Drawing from Wilson’s (1987) social isolation theory and Massey and Denton’s (1993) theory of racial segregation and poor neighborhood formation, I propose that 1) greater residential racial homogeneity and 2) greater white residential segregation will increase average educational attainment at the county level. I analyze data from the 2016 County Health Rankings and Roadmaps along with the 5-year 2011-2015 American Community Survey, both of which yield a total population size of 3,141 counties. The study reveals that the impact of residential segregation on academic achievement is indeed racialized: white residential segregation most strongly affects county percent high school graduation. General residential segregation, however, is positively and significantly related to high school and graduate/PhD degree level completion. Nevertheless, median household income and county rurality are consistently the strongest predictors of high school and graduate/PhD completion across four regression models. While these results confirm both hypotheses, they highlight the strength of alternative explanations for educational gaps in the United States—gaps that may be more directly tied to social capital and rurality. The findings suggest that policies intending to alleviate disparities in educational attainment cannot center segregation alone, they must also offer a broader solution to social isolation and resource deprivation patterns by targeting counties with lower median household incomes and greater rurality.",TRUE,FALSE,education|income inequality|residential segregation,2018-07-02T11:28:50.771164,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-12T20:05:16.862762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/citation/,a4qvk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qe3gf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/relationships/node/,qe3gf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a30079e9da410000feb014d/,5a30079e9da410000feb014d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a4qvk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a4qvk
