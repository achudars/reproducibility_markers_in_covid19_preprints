The current literature is divided on this issue. One line of reasoning suggests that aid is likely to decrease violence by improving employment and prosperity, thereby making participation in conflict more costly. Another view cites evidence showing an association between aid projects and increased insurgent activity. Addressing this contradiction, we argue that different types of aid projects lead to different outcomes, as some projects foster an unequal distribution of benefits within communities. Our reasoning draws on qualitative accounts from conflict zones, recent research on how grievances associated with exclusion can foster civil war onset, and experimental findings regarding perceived inequity and punishment. Building on this scholarship, we use a recently developed event-matching methodology to offer insight from contemporary Afghani- stan. Aid projects that tend to exclude portions of the community yield more insurgent activity in their wake than more inclusive projects. These results shed light on why some aid projects reduce violence while others do not, emphasizing that efforts to ‘win hearts and minds’ can be a source of both contentment and contestation.",TRUE,FALSE,Afghanistan|development aid|event analysis|exclusion|grievances|insurgency|matching,2019-04-17T13:40:41.841159,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:39:43.995114,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/citation/,6ea2r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/avntx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/relationships/node/,avntx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb69c40353c58001b9e7c3b/,5cb69c40353c58001b9e7c3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ea2r/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343318777566,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ea2r

But, how do people “bind” otherwise discrete elements as a single element? In cognitive neuroscience and the philosophy of mind, this is known as the “binding problem.” Sociologists can learn from research on binding, as it deepens our understanding of cultural objects, learning, and social change. Binding is the process by which a material “token” is assimilated into (or expands the boundaries of) a cognitive “type,” or resists such typification thereby leading to the formation of a new cognitive “type.” Cultural objects are simultaneously types and tokens, and the interplay between them results in a fundamental cultural instability. “Binding” is an attempt to stabilize meaning in two ways: the first, innovating, is implicated in the emergence of a cultural object, and the second, indexicalizing, in its maintenance and extension. However, even the process of indexicalizing a well established type—i.e., the proliferation of tokens—provides the material fodder from which to innovate new types. Attention to binding processes in the production and reception of cultural objects reveals important insight into the dynamics of cultural change and stability.",TRUE,FALSE,art|cognition|cultural objects|culture|fuzzy sets|neural binding,2019-04-17T13:40:01.865847,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:39:06.749901,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/citation/,4cvr7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb644f63992690017120858/,5cb644f63992690017120858,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4cvr7/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.01.005,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4cvr7

Explaining the Use of Facebook News Posts as a Substitute for Other News Sources,"An increasing number of, especially younger, users use Facebook as their primary source for news about political and societal issues. At the same time, research suggests that Facebook use contributes to societal knowledge gaps. Against this background, we investigate the antecedents of using Facebook as a substitute for other news sources. We argue that exposure to news posts on Facebook increases the feeling of being well-informed, regardless of actual knowledge acquisition. This might lead users, especially those with a low need for cognition (NfC), to use Facebook as a substitute for other news sources. We test these assumptions with an online survey (n = 390) of German Internet users. Results show that the feeling of being well-informed through Facebook is reinforced by the quantity of exposure to news content on Facebook but not by the amount of actually read news posts. The feeling of being informed is an important predictor of using Facebook news as a substitute. High NfC interferes with this effect. It makes the substitution of other news sources less likely—but only for moderate to high levels of the feeling of being informed. We discuss these results in the light of their societal consequences.",TRUE,FALSE,Facebook|Feeling of Being Informed|Need for Cognition|News Exposure|Substitution,2019-04-17T13:39:27.908432,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:38:09.993222,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,Philipp Müller|Svenja Schäfer|&amp; Pascal Schneiders,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/citation/,cjz54,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb6273d3992690018152062/,5cb6273d3992690018152062,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cjz54/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.003,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cjz54

Evidence from the German Family Panel,"A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalanced local sex ratios are correlated with social consequences, including the pattern and timing of union formation, fertility and relationship stability. Scholars have argued that these findings can be understood as a result of imbalances in the bargaining power the respective sex holds in male- or female-skewed regions, but they remain vague on the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the literature implicitly considers individual partner market experiences to be a function of local sex ratios. However, empirical evidence on the correspondence between subjective partner availability and local sex ratios remains scarce. This study addresses this gap by linking individual-level German longitudinal survey data (pairfam) with local sex ratios from population data for different entities (states, counties, and municipalities). Using multilevel regression models, this paper analyses the correlations between a subjective partner market indicator and a variety of local sex ratio measures. Moreover, an event history analysis explored how either indicator relates transitions into relationships. Results revealed that none of the local sex ratio measures, including those for narrow age ranges and/or lower level administrative entities, significantly predicted whether individuals predominantly met individuals of their own sex. Event history models yielded significant correlations between this subjective partner market indicator and relationship formation for both genders, substantiating the validity of the subjective indicator. For local sex ratios, results revealed an additional association between local sex ratios and female relationship formation when the sex ratios were adjusted for age hypergamy. Male relationship formation was uncorrelated with any local sex ratio. Both evolutionary and social scientific reasoning on the consequences of sex ratio imbalances rest on assumptions of subjective partner availability that may not be adequately represented by local sex ratios. Future research should be careful not to equate local sex ratios and conscious partner market experiences.",TRUE,FALSE,mating|pairfam|partner market|relationship formation|sex ratio,2019-04-17T13:38:28.219770,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:36:59.085763,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/citation/,vs9r3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb5d0f4f2be3c001602c477/,5cb5d0f4f2be3c001602c477,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vs9r3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vs9r3

One longstanding difficulty in the U.S. has been the extreme lack of guidance on how courts are to determine a litigant’s ability to pay. The result has been a seat-of-the-pants approach that is inefficient and inaccurate, and, as a consequence, very socially costly. Fortunately, online platform technology presents a promising avenue for reform. In particular, platform technology offers the potential to increase litigant access, reduce costs, and ensure consistent and fair treatment—all of which should lead to more accurate sanctions. We use interviews, surveys, and case-level data to evaluate and discuss the experiences of six courts that recently adopted an online ability-to-pay assessment tool that streamlines and standardizes ability-to-pay determinations. Our findings suggest that the online tool improves accuracy and therefore the effectiveness of fines as punishments, and so it may make the use of fines as sanctions more socially attractive.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-04-16T17:32:47.480495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-16T17:32:09.743227,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0f|Law|Public Law and Legal Theory|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c36|Law|Courts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4f|Law|Law and Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",Meghan M.

Given that relative discrimination against Black Americans is a compelling justification for policies to reduce Black disadvantage, results from these three surveys suggest that White Americans' policy preferences have much potential to move in a direction that disfavors programs intended to reduce Black disadvantage.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|meta-psychology|perceptions|race,2019-04-16T17:28:28.464021,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-16T17:27:58.006222,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/citation/,e96jr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cgjns/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/relationships/node/,cgjns,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb4f82c399269001813d5bd/,5cb4f82c399269001813d5bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e96jr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e96jr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e96jr

Panel data evidence from The Netherlands during the Great Recession, 2007–2015","Political developments since the 2008 financial crisis have sparked renewed interest in the electoral implications of economic downturns. Research describes a correlation between adverse economic conditions and support for radical parties campaigning on the populist promise to retake the country from a corrupt elite. But does the success of radical parties following economic crises rely on people who are directly affected? To answer this question, we examine whether individual-level changes in economic circumstances drive support for radical parties across the ideological divide. Analyzing eight waves of panel data collected in The Netherlands, before, during, and after the Great Recession (2007–2015), we demonstrate that people who experienced an income loss became more supportive of the radical left but not of the radical right. Looking at these parties’ core concerns, we find that income loss increased support for income redistribution championed by the radical left, but less so for the anti-immigration policies championed by the radical right. Our study establishes more directly than extant research the micro-foundations of support for radical parties across the ideological divide.",TRUE,FALSE,hardship|income loss|inequality|politics|populism|radical left|radical parties|radical right|recession,2019-04-16T17:23:24.871476,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-16T17:23:01.872313,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/citation/,w4e6s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb4b949a3bc970018f2441d/,5cb4b949a3bc970018f2441d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4e6s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w4e6s/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcz023,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w4e6s

In the contexts of work groups and teams, prior research finds that more dense and integrated communication structures support better performance. We explore the relationship between communication structure and group performance in a population of early-stage peer production wiki communities engaged in the collaborative production of shared information resources. We theorize that there is an especially strong need for coordination and social integration in small, newly formed online communities, and that communities with relatively more integrative communication networks will be more successful. We test this theory by measuring communication network structure and group outcomes in a population of 1,002 nascent wikis. Contrary to prior literature and our expectations, we find a very weak relationship between communication structure and collaborative performance. We suggest a number of explanations, including the role of shared artifacts in coordinating work and integrating newcomers.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-04-16T17:20:02.598131,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-16T17:19:39.880303,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/citation/,g95pr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb49781f2be3c00160208dc/,5cb49781f2be3c00160208dc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g95pr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g95pr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g95pr

Previous studies mainly adopted a synchronic approach, implicitly assuming that the differences between students with and without a migration background, as well as mechanisms underlying these differences, are constant throughout the educational career. This hypothesis is empirically tested thanks to INVALSI data and a series of  four-levels random intercept regression models (student, class, school and province). Results indicate that the importance of contextual factors on the ethnic gap in achievements is marginal to the relevance of individual characteristics, and that children of immigrants underperform natives at each educational level. However, assessing the independent role of ethnicity on the one hand, and migration on the other, it emerges that: while the negative influence of the migration experience is strongest at higher grades, the effect of ethnicity changes from negative to positive during the educational career. The chapter discusses the mechanisms underlying the results and the possible implications in terms of social policies.",TRUE,FALSE,children of immigrants|educational achievement|educational career|ethnic penalty|italy|migration|second generations,2019-04-16T17:34:49.828777,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-16T17:34:23.924370,FALSE,NA,no,Data are available upon written request to INVALSI at: https://www.invalsi.it/invalsi/index.php,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/citation/,z95sq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb45063a3bc97001aefe2a0/,5cb45063a3bc97001aefe2a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z95sq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z95sq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z95sq
