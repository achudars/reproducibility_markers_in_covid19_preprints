Paule Marshall’s first novel Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959), focuses on Selina Boyce, a second-generation Barbadian immigrant from the United States, whose search for her roots is informed by an inherent link to the Caribbean through an articulation of the dynamics of belonging. The notion of ‘home’ as a contradictory and contested trope is vital, for the writer’s foremost concern is on the overarching effect it has on the diasporic subject. Marshall grants her protagonist the space to challenge familial struggles, and reclaim her voice by re-locating to Barbados, her parental home. The protagonist’s enigmatic journey through ambivalent interspaces enables her to reconstruct bridges to the West Indies. Marshall’s examination of her young protagonist’s ‘return to the Caribbean’ reflects wider issues of diasporic identity and belonging connected to ‘home’ spaces, ancestral lands, regions, and origins.",TRUE,FALSE,Afro-Caribbean immigrants|Barbados|belonging|diasporic identity|home,2019-07-25T18:36:05.844402,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:35:35.244020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/citation/,dp9bm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yxbgw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/relationships/node/,yxbgw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbbfe8a28e680019a3074e/,5bdbbfe8a28e680019a3074e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dp9bm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dp9bm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dp9bm

It calls for a practice-based research model to materialize the mechanisms needed for the interaction and collaboration of the three stakeholders, which would have positive impacts on the translation landscape. Given that this cross-fertilization can only be beneficial if it is structured and sustained, then it has to be formalized and institutionalized. A plan will be proposed as to how this can be materialized.  It is a thesis of this paper that professional practice needs academic research (theories) to shape it, and theory can only have functional dimensions through professional practice; therefore, there is a pressing need to bridge the gap between “knowing” and “doing” in translation.

The current study, however, illustrates the pervasive syntactic asymmetries in the syntactic output of the translated Quranic text into English. Most translators shift from the word order in Arabic to word order in English to establish a grammatical equivalence between the source text (ST) and the target text (TT) with little consideration of the syntactic typological significance of Arabic as a source language and English as a target one. This study aims to determine the mismatch of the grammatical functions and the syntactic typology of TL vis-à-vis ST. Word order, tense shift, case asymmetry, Ellipsis, passive structures, selectional restrictions and cross formations are some of the grammatical issues that illustrate the syntactic asymmetries in the English translation adopted in this paper. The findings show that different grammatical categories exhibit syntactic asymmetries that would distort the implications or exegesis of the original ST.

The study was discourse-based as it adopted the main premise of the Information Processing approach to SI (Hodzik &amp; Williams 2017, p. 2) which considers interpreting a language-dependent activity. The data consisted of a sample of the aforementioned trainees’ recorded interpretations of a video lecture on solar energy. The data analysis was based on Barik’s (1975, 2002) model of omission, addition and phrasing changes. The results show that the most frequent errors made and/or strategies used by the study subjects are delay omission and comprehension omission. This paper also presents a discourse-based module for SI training. The module is based on the premise that SI comprises an analysis of the comprehension phase of the source speech and the production phase of source speech messages in the target language. The material utilizes the main tenets of Setton’s (1993, 1998, 2002) model of comprehension and production and Seleskovitch’s (2008) model of teaching interpreting.

It is obvious that their construction would have been costly in terms of energy, but it is not clear how they would have enhanced reproductive success. In the late 1980s, the prominent US archaeologist Robert Dunnell proposed a solution to this conundrum. He argued that wasting energy on monuments and other forms of what he dubbed “cultural elaboration” would have conferred a selective advantage in highly variable environments. In the present paper, we report a study in which we used an agent-based model to test the core prediction of Dunnell’s hypothesis. In the model, the agents inherited a propensity to waste and were subjected to selection in low and high variability environments. The results we obtained do not support the hypothesis. We found that the propensity to waste was subject to strong negative selection regardless of the level of environmental variability. At the start of the simulation runs, agents wasted 50% of the time on average, but selection drove that rate down by more than a third after the first generation, ultimately settling at 5-7% on average. We contend that this casts serious doubt on the ability of Dunnell’s hypothesis to explain instances of cultural elaboration in the archaeological record.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|Agent-based  modelling|Cultural elaboration|Environmental variability|Evolutionary archaeology|Monuments|Robert Dunnell|Waste hypothesis,2018-11-02T17:14:01.355043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-02T17:13:42.413355,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,W.

Elman (2007) Sexual equality in an integrated Europe: virtual equality,"I should start by mentioning that this book review has been written by a lawyer and not a political scientist, which accounts to some extent for the perspective taken and comments produced. In this work, Amy Elman proposes a highly critical analysis of the politics surrounding gender equality in the EU. The book is structured in eight main chapters: in chapters 2 and 3 the author sets the background to, and presents a chronological account of, the topic at stake; in chapter 4 she makes a first assessment of the policies in question; in chapter 5 she focuses on the intersection between political participation and gender; in chapter 6 the role of male violence is examined; in chapter 7 the programmes Stop and Daphne are assessed; chapter 8 debates the process of politicisation of (mostly female lesbian) sexuality; and chapter 9 concentrates on the right of same-sex couples to marry. The book chiefly concludes that the EU’s role in this field has primarily been one of maintaining gender inequality, rather than diminishing it.",TRUE,FALSE,European Union|gender discrimination|gender equality,2018-11-02T17:07:44.965758,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-02T17:06:05.499390,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2009,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/citation/,rc3hw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4u9xz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/relationships/node/,4u9xz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdb887aa28e68001ba3eee3/,5bdb887aa28e68001ba3eee3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc3hw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rc3hw/,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5965.2009.00811_7.x,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rc3hw

This work attempts to reduce disproportionate minority contact by formulating a crime hot spots spatial allocation strategy for police that prioritizes areas of high crime, but constrains the targeted hot spots given different levels of acceptable racial inequality. This racial inequality constraint is measured as the proportion of minorities likely to be stopped in those areas prioritized by police. Using data on stops and crime in New York City, I show that police stops can be more equitably distributed according to race, but there are fundamental trade-offs. One cannot gain a racial distribution of stops proportionately equal to the residential population without large decreases in the efficiency of targeting high crime areas. More modest gains can be had though in reducing the proportion of minorities stopped while still targeting high crime locations.

Evidence from the UN General Debate,"The question of whether Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs) have a socialization effect on member state preferences is central to International Relations. However, empirical studies have struggled to separate the socializing effects of IGOs on preferences from the incentives generated by IGOs that may lead to foreign policy alignment without altering preferences. This paper addresses this shortcoming. We adopt a new approach to measuring state preferences by applying text analytic methods to country statements in the annual UN General Debate (UNGD). The absence of inter-state coordination with UNGD statements makes them ideal for testing socialization effects on state preferences. We focus on the European Union (EU), enabling us to incorporate the pre-accession period – when states have the strongest incentives for foreign policy alignment – into our analysis. The results of our statistical analysis demonstrates that EU membership has a strong socialization effect that produces member state preference convergence, controlling for incentive effects.",TRUE,FALSE,European Union|foreign policy|intergovernmental organizations|socialization|state preferences|text analysis|United Nations|United Nations General Debate,2018-11-01T19:24:43.356255,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-01T16:12:33.670085,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/citation/,e5hrk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdadb7d9764d2001c5822b3/,5bdadb7d9764d2001c5822b3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5hrk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5hrk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e5hrk
