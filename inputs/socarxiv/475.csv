Modern economics operates basically through two major modes of entrepreneurships: the market/private sector economics relying on commercial entrepreneurships (self-interest- centric) and the state/public sector economics relying on state entrepreneurships (public-wellbeing-centric). However, both have, individually and jointly, failed to ensure economics‟ fundamental goal of wellbeing for human societies. In response, a community wellbeing-centric social enterprise economics (third sector), which features cooperatives and not-for-profit social enterprises in the name of foundations, trusts/awqāf, social businesses, and similar undertakings, has emerged as a make-up strategy to meet the minimum unmet requirements for social wellbeing. However, there is a strongly felt belief that this community wellbeing-centric social enterprise economics needs to be broadened and mainstreamed in order to include entirely charitable institutions, predominantly not-for-profit operations, and predominantly for-profit businesses but blended with provision of social welfare programs like corporate social responsibility, etc., for its emancipation as a major economic system to be able to play a leading role for ensuring desirable economic growth and development. Islamic entrepreneurship, which is basically a community-centric mode of business initiative, is closely related to social entrepreneurship. It is an antidote to the problem of intolerable economic and social dualism and a natural strategy against all forms of capitalist exploitation to control world resources, like, in the past, through European colonialism, and now, through American-led state terrorism. It is the natural guard against economic inequity, wealth concentration, and social divides. Based on its potential and using examples from Bangladesh and Malaysia, we argue that the Islamic style social entrepreneurship, which is operationally a profession for a mission, is intellectually and operationally superior and more efficient for effectively widening and mainstreaming community-centric social enterprise economics to ensure development with equity and social justice. The paper aims to put forward social enterprise economics (third sector) for dialogue and research in the context of effective functioning of modern economies ensuring community wellbeing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-28T18:54:09.344734,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T18:53:27.134645,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/citation/,r286g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/unj8f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/relationships/node/,unj8f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c77654462c82a0019ddefce/,5c77654462c82a0019ddefce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r286g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r286g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r286g

Data of the study were collected based on a questionnaire survey from 550 microentrepreneurs from the urban areas of Selangor.

However, the study found that still there is potential for microfinance borrowing with around 55,000-128,000 microenterprises in Selangor, Malaysia.

This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey that was distributed by email using the Google Doc application among the head of department of 682 departments and agencies under 24 federal ministries including the Prime Minister Department in Malaysia. Finally, based on the email responses, the final sample of the study is 109 respondents. The data were collected based on the opinion about ten factors of accountability practices in the department or agency by using seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The data are analysed under descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Further, the reliability of the data is tested by using Cronbach alpha test, and the validity of data is tested by checking the normality of data through Shapiro Wilk test and graphically. Overall, 87.3% of the respondents mentioned that overall they practice accountability in their department. However, the priority of these ten factors of accountability differs among the services schemes. The accountability in the administrative &amp; diplomatic, education, and medical &amp; health is below the overall average accountability. The accountability in the financial and information system schemes is also not strong enough. Therefore the public sector in Malaysia needs to be transformed into becoming a reliable and efficient sector by ensuring proper accountability and its proper assessment system.",TRUE,FALSE,Accountability System; Public Sector; Factor Analysis; Malaysia,2019-02-28T16:52:47.487627,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T16:52:04.702086,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/citation/,x5dtf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/euthd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/relationships/node/,euthd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7757d28d5d98001a3dd272/,5c7757d28d5d98001a3dd272,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5dtf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x5dtf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x5dtf

The food and feeding habits including types and amount of feed and seasonal pattern of feeding were studied. 168 Aspidoparia morar were collected from the River Padma, Rajshahi, Bangladesh from May to December, 2011. The relationship between total length and alimentary canal length was tested using OLS regression. Qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of stomach and gut contents of each fish were done by percentage of occurrence and point method and fullness of stomach was measured by fullness index method. Aspidoparia morar was omnivorous due to the presence of both phytoplankton (Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae) and zooplankton (Rotifera, Crustacea) in the gut content. Based on the point method, the average percentage of phytoplankton and zooplankton was 80.71% and 19.29%, respectively. The highest average percentage of fullness was 72.62% in October whereas the lowest was 56.55% in December. The highest average percentage of emptiness recorded was 43.45% in December and the lowest was 27.38% in October. Total length was found statistically positively significant (P0.01) with the alimentary canal length. Overall, the article concludes that Aspidoparia morar is an omnivore with a higher feeding preference for phytoplankton and the food habits change with the seasons based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of food.",TRUE,FALSE,emptiness of stomach|feeding intensity|Food and feeding habit|fullness of stomach|plankton,2019-02-28T16:49:23.710715,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28T16:49:02.647953,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/citation/,kybg9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nqshr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/relationships/node/,nqshr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7754b782a3950018ce8fbf/,5c7754b782a3950018ce8fbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kybg9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kybg9
