To contrast the relative significance of economic homogeneity versus the efficacy of welfare state and labor market institutions in shaping income distributions, we compare the structure of inequality in the EU-28 to that of the 50 United States. This comparison stands in contrast to the standard practice of evaluating the US against individual EU Member States. Despite the greater relative heterogeneity of the 28 EU Member States and our corrections for the underreporting of household income in the US, post-fisc income inequality in the EU-28 remains lower than that of the US from 2006 onward. Moreover, inequality appears to be rising in the US while it has remained stagnant since 2008 in the EU-28. In both unions, and particularly the US, within-state income differences contribute more to union-wide inequality than between-state differences. In a counterfactual analysis, we find that if the EU-28 matched the between-state homogeneity of the US, but maintained its relative within-country inequalities, pan-European inequality would fall by only 20 percent. Conversely, inequality in the US would fall by 34 percent if it matched the within-country inequality of the EU-28. Our findings suggest that the strengthening of egalitarian institutions within the 28 Member States is more consequential than economic convergence in reducing pan-European income inequality. We highlight institutional challenges toward achieving a ‘more equal’ Europe and discuss implications for future EU policymaking.",TRUE,FALSE,European Union|federalism|income inequality|inequality|social policy|welfare state,2018-09-06T15:33:03.847384,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T15:32:01.218233,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/citation/,g4cd3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/csmhu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/relationships/node/,csmhu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9141df57f3d1001a5fa0b1/,5b9141df57f3d1001a5fa0b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g4cd3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g4cd3/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0958928718807332,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g4cd3

Though the justification may go beyond the desire to overcome incentive problems (such as moral hazard or adverse selection), it is desirable for payments to be closely tied to impacts – “as if” to incentivize implementers to perform in the interests of program beneficiaries. We describe a so-called impact bond transaction in the poverty alleviation space that commits payments in direct proportion to the economic value created in beneficiary households. Even so, incentive-compatibility is not easily achieved in practice: when funders insure themselves against extreme outcomes, and when working capital providers absorb performance risk, they alter the shape of the reward function.

Using data from the Project on Devolution and Urban Change, a unique geographically-linked, longitudinal, multi-city set of survey data, logistic regression models weigh the relative importance of individual barriers to employment (poor health, childcare and family responsibilities, etc.) and contextual or neighborhood barriers to employment (poverty rate, joblessness rate, etc.) on labor market outcomes.  Results reveal that several neighborhood characteristics are predictive of employment, including automobile access, female-headedness, vacancy, and disorder.  Results suggest a more complex, nuanced interplay between neighborhood-level variables and individually-measured variables in preventing some women from obtaining both modestly paying employment with few allocated hours of work per week, and also better-paying jobs with more hours of work per week.",TRUE,FALSE,Employment|Gender|Neighborhood effects|Welfare reform,2018-09-06T14:53:02.644598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T14:49:35.860865,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/citation/,57e4a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6k7ph/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/relationships/node/,6k7ph,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b90459dc14d70001911080a/,5b90459dc14d70001911080a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/57e4a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/57e4a/,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9906.2012.00636.x,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/57e4a

Yet catastrophic events, like disasters, have the potential to rupture or disrupt complacency toward environmental problems, forcing individuals to consider the potential effects of human activity on the environment as they expose how environmentally harmful practices put people at risk.  This article is based on focus group interviews with 46 residents of High River, Alberta, a rural community hardest hit by the 2013 Southern Alberta flood.  It examines if and how experiencing the flood prompted residents to think about the environment or interact with it in new ways.  Findings suggest that residents voice a contradiction- while they believe that pre-flood human activity like deforestation, river diversion, and home-building altered the environment and placed communities like their own at risk, they also argue that natural forces like disasters are immune to human efforts to control them.  Residents feel their environment is less stable and predicable since the flood, and they worry more about toxicity and associated environmental health risks.  The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for environmental sociology and public policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|change|disaster|environmental views|flood|uncertainty,2018-09-06T14:53:42.527893,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-06T14:51:17.102665,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/citation/,s4ufr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t2myr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/relationships/node/,t2myr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b903e5e7f716c00195d9ea6/,5b903e5e7f716c00195d9ea6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4ufr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s4ufr/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496516669351,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s4ufr

The relationship between energy consumption and age is complex and understudied. We evaluated the existence and determinants of an age-energy consumption profile in the U.S. residential sector, using microdata from four waves of the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) in 1987, 1990, 2005, and 2009. We constructed pseudo cohorts from Bayesian generalized linear model estimates to draw micro-profiles for energy consumption across the life course. Overall, we found that residential energy consumption increases over the life course. Much of the increase in energy consumption is due to housing size. Variations in the age-energy consumption micro-profiles can be described by concave and convex functions.

In this paper, through an account of the ‘reflexive moments’ I encountered during my doctoral research which employed critical theory perspective and constructivist grounded theory methodology, I elaborate how ethics, methodology and theory construction are intertwined.  Further, I will dwell on the significance of reflexivity, particularly in qualitative research analyzing bioethics concepts. Through an account of the universal ethical principles that ‘I’, as a researcher, encounter, and micro-analysis of the observed relationships that influence the theoretical construction and arguments developed, this paper explores the quandaries an ethics researcher undertaking reflexive approach faces. I elucidate that reflexivity unveils for both the researcher and the reader how the researcher arrives at certain positions that the researcher puts forward and endorses during the knowledge construction process. I conclude by stating that reflexivity demystifies the moral and epistemological stances of the study and researcher.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-04T14:51:23.637257,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-04T14:51:05.909254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/citation/,9dfkq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2xwtg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/relationships/node/,2xwtg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8e1e8dcc53a90019358501/,5b8e1e8dcc53a90019358501,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9dfkq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9dfkq/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2059799119863276,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9dfkq

First, charismatic leaders can outflank traditional leaders’ aspersions of folk devils, taking the principle of ‘one-upmanship’ to an extraordinary (and therewith charismatic) extreme. Second, charismatic leaders can creatively subvert traditional mores, overturning value tables to ‘bedevil’ traditional leaders. Because moral panic and charismatic enthusiasm implicate distinct, complementary, and unitary social processes, I argue that, taken together, the work of Max Weber and Stanley Cohen offer a more theoretically profitable vision of moral denaturation and reformulation than either would alone. Donald Trump’s charismatic ascension during his 2015–16 US Presidential campaign is used to illustrate the theoretical contribution.",TRUE,FALSE,Altruism|American Presidents|Arlie

However, there has been less focus on the physical infrastructure as the ‘last mile’ problem for Internet access, between a revanchist perspective on the ‘broken Internet’ delivered by digital capitalism and the liberal rhetoric of the Internet as a human right. Through two case studies, the paper plots a pragmatic trajectory in the adoption of the Internet for people and ‘things’, in which city and users take different roles and responsibilities. It highlights benefits and challenges around the long-term sustainability and maintenance of the Internet as an infrastructure of the commons. An attention to ‘commoning’, instead, reveals the exclusionary or enabling practices the smart city might foster. Thus, the paper advocates for the direct involvement of the city and its citizens in maintaining and reproducing connectivity networks in the smart city.",TRUE,FALSE,Commoning|Commons|IoT|Public Internet|Smart City|Wi-Fi Networks,2018-09-04T01:00:22.049501,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-04T01:00:02.423740,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/citation/,u8dk2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4xkca/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/relationships/node/,4xkca,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8d515f6a59a500197035bd/,5b8d515f6a59a500197035bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8dk2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u8dk2/,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4XKCA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u8dk2
