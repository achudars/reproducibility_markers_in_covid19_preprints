We show that default dependency has a significant impact on asset pricing. In fact, correlated default risk is one of the most pervasive threats in financial markets.

In this way, both the development on ‘smart’ technology itself and its criticisms are the latest chapter in a long-standing disciplinary debate around quantification and technology. We re-evaluate this history and argue that quantitative methodology and its theoretical critiques are not as incompatible as often claimed.

To illustrate how we might address this apparent tension between theory and quantitative methods we review how both approaches conceptualize one of Geography’s core concepts: space, and highlight opportunities for symbiosis. Although smart technologies can further orthodox positivist approaches, we argue that the actual practice is more nuanced and not necessarily absolute or totalizing. For example, recent computational work builds upon critical geographic theories to analyze and visualize topological and relational spaces, relevant to topics such as gentrification and segregation. The result is not a Geography in which smart technology and algorithms remove the need for human input but rather a rejoinder in line with the recent resurgence of a critical quantitative geography. In short, a Geography where social theory and the human intellect play a key role in guiding computational approaches to analyze the largest, most versatile and relevant datasets on social space that we have ever had.",TRUE,FALSE,geocomputation|GIScience|smart technology|space|spatial science,2019-11-11T20:52:02.557514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11T20:51:34.945491,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/citation/,u2w6n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc98288ee9bb9000d4ccc10/,5dc98288ee9bb9000d4ccc10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2w6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2w6n,https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1674630

Our argument is that these two forms of critique are systematically opposed to each other: They are based on opposing epistemic premises, they are motivated by opposing political concerns, and they pursue opposing visions of social progress. Scholars of International Relations (IR) who want to work with the conceptual tools of practice theory are thus confronted with a consequential choice. Understanding the alternatives can help them to be more self-reflexive in their research practices and intervene more forcefully in contemporary political debates.

Examined phenomena include, for example, variation in past human population levels and climate-change-driven sea level fluctuations. These processes are thought to have affected the amount of organic carbon deposited into the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record at a given time. Time-series representing through-time fluctuations in the frequency of dated radiocarbon samples are, therefore, often used as proxies for such processes. However, there are important problems with radiocarbon-date proxies that have so far gone underappreciated in the scientific literature. The primary problem is that the proxies are easily misinterpreted, and this has serious implications for downstream analyses. Here we report the results of a two-part study. In the first part, we investigated the most accurate interpretation of radiocarbon-date proxies produced with each of the two established methods, widely-used summed probability density functions and a new kernel density estimation approach. In the second part, we performed a simulated regression experiment to determine whether the proxies could be used to quantitatively investigate the processes they are often thought to represent. Our analyses unfortunately reveal that the proxies do not reflect what they are generally thought to---i.e., through-time variation in processes correlated with radiocarbon sample frequency. Rather, they represent a combination of through-time variation in sample frequency and chronological uncertainty. More importantly, though, our regression experiment demonstrated that the proxies can produce very misleading results. While the proxies may be useful under certain conditions for addressing certain kinds of research questions, they are not generally suitable as representations of through-time processes. A major implication of this finding is that a significant number of high-profile published studies may be reporting false results based on misinterpretations of core data. Another major implication is that the proxies should be avoided in future research when the goal is to understand through-time variation in a given process.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeological and Palaeoenvironmental Data Science|Archaeology|Bayesian Regression|Palaeoenvironmental Science|Radiocarbon Date Proxies|Simulation|SPDF|Summed Probability Density Functions|Summed Radiocarbon Date Densities,2019-11-11T20:48:21.599206,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11T20:47:59.611851,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/citation/,yp38j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v93zu/,v93zu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc9756c7f37e3000dccef95/,5dc9756c7f37e3000dccef95,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yp38j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yp38j,NA

This poses a challenge to the agencies and officers in charge of providing supervision—there are far more offenders in need of supervision than officers can reasonably attend to. This has forced agencies to be innovative in how they allocate their resources. Empirical evidence suggests resources should be allocated to high-risk offenders, but how can officers determine which offender is at a higher risk of misconduct at any given time? Traditionally, this has been achieved by relying on standardized risk assessment. But risk assessment has been criticized for making only marginally better-than-chance predictions of future misconduct. We offer a novel solution by integrating the Elo-rating system into the community supervision decision-making process. We show, by drawing on test data from the Pathways to Desistance Study, that combining the Elo-rating system with traditional risk assessment may lead to increases in predictive power.

Multiple interviews were done, tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim to form the narratives of the study.
Further, the approach espoused by van Manen was employed as the process of reflective explication of the narratives of the co-researchers. From the process, three themes were revealed and are as follows: (1) in a suspended reality, (2) bargaining with time, and (3) restless in a resting place. These themes are the overarching patterns of the lives of the co-researchers. Further reflection from these themes generated the essence of the co-researchers lives, encapsulated by the phrase “Hope within Hopelessness”. 
Insights from the study suggest that the co-researchers continue to have a glimmer of hope even though the overall context of their experience is that of hopelessness since they seem to have attributed DNR with imminent death.

The current study expanded on previous research by analyzing emotional experiences and compiling themes in relation to the use of Instagram by people with Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a highly visual, often stigmatizing, common skin condition that causes loss of pigmentation (color) which affects up to 2% of the population globally regardless of race or gender. Instagram was picked for this study due to its visual nature. This application allows the use of hashtags as a search tool for possible connections with others.

We operationalize the three-systems model that understands functional settlement geographies through the interaction between the daily urban system, the central place system and the export base system. We utilize theoretically-informed selections of spatial interactions derived from travel survey data at the finely-grained postcode level. After examining the methodological challenge of the node-inclusivity dilemma, we estimate the causal mechanisms that geographically structure each system and determine which spatial interactions should be assigned to nodes (containment) and edges (connectivity). The three systems produce different regionalizations that are neither mutually exclusive nor perfectly nested. Further analysis of the multiplexity of the three systems reveals the importance of the imbricated boundaries between the urban subsystems. We argue that these interplaces deserve more attention as they are particularly sensitive to changes in urbanization trends.",TRUE,FALSE,Netherlands|nodalization|node-inclusivity dilemma|spatial interaction|three-systems model|urban network analysis|urban systems,2019-11-10T20:02:41.383212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-10T20:02:16.319121,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/citation/,y7dxf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc82de9a1cd9e000c72cf74/,5dc82de9a1cd9e000c72cf74,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y7dxf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y7dxf,https://doi.org/10.1111/tesg.12391

Today, human sociopolitical complexity ranges from stateless small-scale societies to complex states that integrate millions of individuals over vast geographic areas. Here, we explore major transitions across this range of complexity. In particular, we examine the statistical structure of these transitions using Horton-Strahler branching, generalized Horton Laws, and allometric spatial mixed-effect models. We show that all major transitions in sociopolitical complexity follow an invariant fractal-like growth process; with each transition there is an additional level of jurisdictional hierarchy, a four-fold increase in population size, a two-fold increase in population area, and therefore a doubling of population density. These statistics fully describe all transitions from the least to the most complex societies. However, these transitions are probabilistic, not deterministic in nature. This fact explains the asymmetry of human sociopolitical evolution: while more complex societies were necessarily once less complex, less complex societies do not necessarily become more complex.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-11-10T20:01:02.491854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-10T20:00:48.276048,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/citation/,f693m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc81c25ee9bb9000e4d09cd/,5dc81c25ee9bb9000e4d09cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f693m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f693m,NA
