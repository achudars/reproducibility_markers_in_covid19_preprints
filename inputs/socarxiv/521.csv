Technology law scholars have recently started to consider the theories of affordance and technological mediation, imported from the fields of psychology, HCI, and STS. These theories have been used both as a means of explaining how the law has developed, and more recently in attempts to cast the law per se as an affordance. This exploratory paper summarises the two theories, before considering these applications from a critical perspective, noting certain deficiencies with respect to potential normative application and definitional clarity, respectively. It then posits that in applying them in the legal context, we should seek to retain the relational user-artefact structure around which they were originally conceived, with the law cast as the user of the artefact, from which it seeks certain features or outcomes. This approach is effective for three reasons. Firstly, it acknowledges the power imbalance between law and architecture, where the former is manifestly subject to the decisions made by designers which mediate and transform the substance of the legal norms they instantiate in technological artefacts. Secondly, from an analytical perspective, it can help avoid some of the conceptual and definitional problems evident in the nascent legal literature on affordance. Lastly, approaching designers on their own terms can foster better critical evaluation of their activities during the design process, potentially leading to more effective ‘compliance by design’ where the course of the law’s mediation by technological artefacts can be better anticipated and guided by legislators, regulators, and legal practitioners.",TRUE,FALSE,affordance|compliance by design|legal design|legal theory|postphenomenology|technological mediation,2018-07-02T11:51:25.504637,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-10T15:12:55.045627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0f|Law|Public Law and Legal Theory|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c31|Law|Rule of Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c62|Law|Jurisprudence|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d37|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|Industrial and Product Design|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dba|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Legal Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/citation/,xntyr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5enas/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/relationships/node/,5enas,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af44409d6e6eb0011225c49/,5af44409d6e6eb0011225c49,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xntyr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xntyr/,https://doi.org/10.2966/scrip.150118.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xntyr

In so doing, this article advances the “charismatic counter-role” as an umbrella term that captures the performative bearing of a variety of actors on processes of charismatic interaction. Speciﬁcally, in addition to devoted followers (already much discussed in the literature), this typology contains unworthy challengers (competitors who fall short when judged by the new terms of legitimacy that the charismatic leader creatively establishes); and colossal players (interlocutors that are appropriately “to scale” for highlighting the extraordinary missions to which the charismatic leader aspires). Together, these charismatic counter-roles interact in ways that comprise a charismatic social system that gives a better account than has heretofore been available for the unstoppable momentum of charismatic challenges.

However, these same platforms enable institutional and organized actors to engineer fabricated social movements to advance their agenda. These “astroturfing” or “false amplification” phenomenons leverage a variety of of tools and techniques, ranging from fully automated bot activity to accounts manned by extrinsically motivated (e.g. compensated) human operators. These campaigns also range from simple spam operations to sophisticated efforts involving numerous orchestrated accounts, sometimes coordinated across linguistic and cultural clusters. While the former category is straightforward to analyze via data mining methods, sophisticated fabricated campaigns in the latter category are engineered to mask their true nature from the public.

Working from the proposition that a large number of accounts controlled by a small number of coordinated entities will lack the behavioral diversity of a similar number of accounts controlled by uncoordinated individual actors, we propose a framework of signals (metrics) along three dimensions: 

Network: how accounts are connected to one another, and the clusters they form within the online conversation,   
Temporal: patterns of messaging across time in the online conversation, 
Semantic: an observation of the diversity of topics and meaning throughout the online conversation.

We test this framework on three case studies: the online conversation on #ColumbianChemicals in the U.S., the international discussion of the #DopingLeaks event, and an analysis of political discussions in Venezuela. In all three cases, we find what we assess to be anomalous, fabricated behavior on at least one dimension.",TRUE,FALSE,media manipulation|propaganda|social media|social movements,2018-07-02T11:51:12.230425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-09T19:41:19.700505,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,Camille Francois|Vladimir Barash|John Kelly,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/citation/,ba8t6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/aj9yz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/relationships/node/,aj9yz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af342d0d6e6eb001121d1b5/,5af342d0d6e6eb001121d1b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba8t6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ba8t6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ba8t6

Caste is conceptualized as a system of ethnic categories that map onto positions within the social structure of each village. Despite being a salient category across India, the caste structure is not uniform across villages, caste groups or network contexts. Using social network and demographic data collected by Banerjee et al. (2013) I investigate how caste homophily varies within villages across social contexts and between villages. Overall I find strong evidence of caste homophily across the majority of contexts; people tend to exchange resources and socialize with other people occupying a similar position in the caste order. However this varies across villages, relations, and groups. It appears to be strongest among higher caste groups, although it weakens with regards to the lending and borrowing of money, a vertical relationship between high and low castes. The lending of rice and kerosene and social relationships involving advice giving and important decisions are also particularly homophilous for both groups. This demonstrates how the strength of ethnic boundaries can vary based on the relational and spatial context.",TRUE,FALSE,caste|ethnicity|homophily|india|microcredit|social networks|social structure|village,2018-07-02T11:51:12.054660,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-09T19:27:35.791059,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/citation/,j367u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m8qfx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/relationships/node/,m8qfx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af33307a5bbbc0012c4e19c/,5af33307a5bbbc0012c4e19c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j367u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j367u/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j367u

It helps in solving problems of the entire nation with reference to the needs of the citizens. It is crucial to understand political participation of the aged citizens in the sociological context, within the more political sociological framework, and look at the internal operation of a political system to determine the extent to which participation of older adults occurs. Aims: The study proposes a research protocol in order to understand the participation of elderly Iranian Kurdish in the political process. The study will make an attempt to understand the fundamental political rights, healthy aging, ageism, independent associations and role of political parties, student struggle, freedom of expression, whether free elections exists. These will reflect participation of Kurdish older people in political activities in the entire cities of Kurdish inhabited region of Iran. Methods: According to the census conducted in 2017, the population of Kurdistan of Iran was 7500 million dwellers and the aged people were estimated to be 1125 million citizens which are 15% of population.

The Effect of Power-Sharing Arrangements on Post-War Violence,"How does power-sharing between government and rebels affect the use of violence by political actors outside of peace agreements? To address this puzzle, I propose a political economy model of power-sharing and post-war violence. Power-sharing regulates elites' access to state resources and thus determines whether government and rebels can successfully suppress post-war rebellions. Personalized power-sharing gives elites privileged access to state resources, facilitates effective counter-insurgency strategies, and thus decreases post-war violence. In contrast, structural power-sharing limits elites' access to resources and their ability to prevent armed challenges resulting in higher levels of post-war violence. I test these propositions with a quantitative analysis of peace agreements in Africa and Asia signed between 1990 and 2006. The statistical findings lend support to my theoretical reasoning.",TRUE,FALSE,civil wars|conflict management|political economy|power-sharing|rebellion,2018-07-02T11:51:09.978476,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-08T20:56:26.888517,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Martin Ottmann,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/citation/,s48hz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gsvh3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/relationships/node/,gsvh3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af077ad445e23000efcdd96/,5af077ad445e23000efcdd96,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s48hz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s48hz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s48hz

Scholars in media and communication studies have shown that these platform companies’ control over interface and algorithm design,gives them a disproportionately large power, compared to their users, to fundamentally reshape politically salient categories like the “social” or the “innovative.”  This paper argues that this power of platforms stems from their ability to shape organizational roles and the division of labor.  Based on an ethnographic study of the edX organization, I describe how the architects at edX transformed it from an educational company into a platform by building digital interfaces and formatting multiple organizational roles (their own, those of their “users”) to engineer a dichotomy between “software” and “education.”  I suggest that platform studies should expand its concept of governance to include the socio-technical-discursive work of engineering organizational roles and the division of labor.",TRUE,FALSE,Critical algorithm studies|expertise|higher education|infrastructure|labor|MOOCs|platform studies|software studies|work,2018-07-02T11:51:08.844422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-08T17:56:04.581525,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/citation/,z6btm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aef57b258015f000f08251b/,5aef57b258015f000f08251b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6btm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z6btm/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444817728682,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z6btm

However, diagnostics for ERGM have lagged behind their use. Collinearity-type problems can emerge without detection when fitting ERGM, skewing coefficients, biasing standard errors, and yielding inconsistent model estimates. This article provides a method to detect multicollinearity in ERGM. It outlines the problem and provides a method to calculate the variance inflation factor from ERGM parameters. It then evaluates the method with a Monte Carlo simulation, fitting 216,000 ERGMs and calculating the variance inflation factors for each model. The distribution of variance inflation factors is analyzed using multilevel regression to determine what network characteristics lend themselves to collinearity-type problems. The relationship between variance inflation factors and unstable standard errors (a standard sign of collinearity) is also examined. The method is shown to effectively detect multicollinearity and guidelines for interpretation are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,diagnostics|ERGM|multicollinearity|Social networks analysis|Statistical networks,2018-07-02T11:51:06.794150,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-04T20:40:26.097564,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,Sociological Methods and Research,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/citation/,2tgm7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4amwk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/relationships/node/,4amwk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aeca003b80ad4001054d39a/,5aeca003b80ad4001054d39a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tgm7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2tgm7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2tgm7

The following development will make three key points: (i) Media reporting can be heterogeneous, often due to partisanship: A variance exists in events’ attention and presentation across media outlets. This variance is often not randomly distributed; different media outlets choose the cues that matter to them, and report them in a way that aligns with their motives and strategic goals. This is of crucial importance because: (ii) Different media outlets have different reaches: Media outlets reach broader or smaller audiences depending on whether these audiences have self-selected to follow these outlets. Thus, variances in perceptions among audiences can be due to the specific narrative an audience is exposed to. The previous two points are currently augmented by the recent surge of online and social media, which leads to: (iii) The media field has become more fragmented: Anyone can use social media and online platforms—such as Facebook or Twitter—to act as media themselves. This makes capturing media discourse more challenging.",TRUE,FALSE,Communication|Management|Media|Organization theory|Scandal|Social evaluations,2018-07-02T11:51:06.759040,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-04T17:29:33.713269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,academy of management,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/citation/,t3z6g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z5q7t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/relationships/node/,z5q7t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aec928558015f000e06dad3/,5aec928558015f000e06dad3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3z6g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t3z6g/,https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2016.0537,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t3z6g
