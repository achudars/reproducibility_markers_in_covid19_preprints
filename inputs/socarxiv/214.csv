However, demographic paradigms disagree about whether that relationship should hold at very high levels of development. Using national-level data through 2005, Myrskylä, Kohler, and Billari (2009) found that very high levels of the Human Development Index (HDI) were associated with increasing total fertility rates (TFR). This paper updates that finding with data up to 2017. It investigates whether the observed association has continued to hold for the countries originally studied and whether it holds for countries that have more recently reached very high HDI. For countries that reached HDI ≥ 0.8 in 2000 or before (n=27), the data indicate no clear relationship between changes in HDI and TFR at HDI ≥ 0.8. There is also no clear relationship for countries that reached HDI ≥ 0.8 between 2001 and 2010 (n=13). For countries that reached HDI ≥ 0.8 in 2000 or before, there appear to have been notable increases in TFR between 2000 and 2010, but those gains appear to have completely reversed between 2010 and 2017. The past finding of TFR increases at very high levels of development has not borne out in recent years. In fact, TFRs declined markedly in very high development countries between 2010 and 2017. This paper contributes to the debate over the relationship between development and fertility.

Such practices are also called: reorientation therapy, reparative therapy, sexual orientation change efforts, ex-gay/ex-trans therapy, gay cure therapy, or more recently, support for unwanted same-sex attraction or transgender identities.  To discover global prevalence of both conversion therapy and various methods of practicing attempted therapy a survey was distributed online.  The survey was developed by combining existing measurement tools with newly designed questions to gauge experiences with conversion therapy. The survey consisted of a series of 44 questions covering a range of topics, including personal experience with conversion therapy, types of therapy experienced, long-term impacts, mental health, human rights, faith, and others. The survey was provided in several languages, including English, Arabic, Traditional and Simplified Chinese, and others. Any Hornet user was able to voluntarily participate in the survey. 8092 individuals from over 100 countries participated in the survey, ranging in age from under 18 to 85+.  8092 individuals from over 100 countries participated in the survey, ranging in age from under 18 to 85+. Of the 5820 individuals who responded to the question “Does conversion therapy happen in your country?”, 1851 participants responded “yes,” that they were aware conversion therapy occurs in the country where they live, and 1227 (21.08%) and 1263 (21.70%) responding that they were unsure or maybe, respectively.  1627 (20.09%) of respondents indicated that either they or someone they know (family member, friend, etc.) have been in conversion therapy. The majority of practitioners who led conversion therapy were mental health providers, followed by religious authorities or their associates.

Over time, these naturalistic pictures became simplified into abstract forms. Thus the iconic ox’s head   of Egyptian hieroglyphics transformed into the Phoenician   and eventually the Roman letter A. In this vein, attempts to theorize the evolution of writing have tended to propose variations on a model of unilinear and unidirectional progression. According to this progressivist formula, pictorial scripts will tend to become more schematic while their systems will target smaller linguistic units. Objections to this theory point to absent, fragmentary or contrary paleographic evidence, especially for predicted transitions in the underlying grammatical systems of writing. However, the forms of individual signs, such as the letter A, are nonetheless observed to change incrementally over time. We claim that such changes are predictable and that scripts will, in fact, become visually simpler in the course of their use, a hypothesis regularly confirmed in transmission chain experiments that use graphic stimuli. To test the wider validity of this finding we turn to the Vai script of Liberia, a syllabic writing system invented in relative isolation by non-literates in ca. 1833. Unlike the earliest systems of the ancient world, Vai has the advantage of having been systematically documented from its earliest beginnings until the present day. Using established methods for quantifying visual complexity we find that the Vai script has become increasingly compressed over the first 171 years of its history, complementing earlier claims and partial evidence that similar processes were at work in early writing systems. As predicted, letters simplified to a greater extent when their initial complexity was higher.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Evolution|Evolution of Writing|Palaeography|Paleography|Vai|Writing Systems,2020-04-25T19:39:21.840988,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T19:39:06.034575,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/citation/,eg489,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea3ad4ce4f081005c076834/,5ea3ad4ce4f081005c076834,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eg489/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eg489/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eg489

Evidence from Four European Countries,"Reforms in the minimum school leaving age are candidates for policies affecting the intergenerational transmission of education. I propose that the societal contexts in which these reforms occur may moderate their effects on educational mobility and that the reforms may affect differently educational mobility of men and women. In order to test these hypotheses, I estimate cross-country variation and gender differences in the effects of increases in the minimum school leaving age on educational mobility in four European countries. I employ data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) on Austria, Denmark, France, and the Netherlands. Results show that increasing the minimum school leaving age did decrease the association between parental education and respondent’s years of education in Austria and in France but not in Denmark and in the Netherlands. These findings support the hypothesis according to which the effects of the reforms on educational mobility are stronger in countries with lower average educational attainment prior to the reforms. Analyses focusing on specific levels of education show that in all four countries educational mobility increased with respect to compulsory education but remained unchanged for post-secondary education. These findings are in line with maximally maintained inequality theory, which postulates that reforms increase educational mobility only at levels of education that are almost universally attained by children from socioeconomically advantaged families. Contrary to my theoretical expectations, I find no evidence for gender differences in the effects of the reforms on educational mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,compulsory school leaving age|cross-national comparison|education|intergenerational mobility|natural experiment,2020-04-25T00:46:45.238782,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:46:20.411607,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/citation/,vhd4z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/afz29/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/relationships/node/,afz29,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea2a7b641327c002bc811e2/,5ea2a7b641327c002bc811e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhd4z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vhd4z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhd4z

Background: The first two decades of the 21st century have witnessed two major economic crises: the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty rates among families with young children grew substantially during the Great Recession. Families with young children are also more vulnerable to instability during the COVID-19 pandemic as job losses have been steeper and childcare availability has been significantly curtailed. Programs like Head Start that support at-risk families may mitigate such negative consequences.
Method: This study uses data from the American Community Survey from 2006 through 2016 and state-level data on Head Start availability from Program Information Reports. Growth curve modeling is used to examine how the availability of Head Start predicted poverty growth during the Great Recession and the speed of recovery post-recession.
Results: States with higher rates of Head Start enrollment had a smaller increase in family poverty during the Great Recession and a more stable recovery than states with lower Head Start enrollment.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that greater access to Head Start programs prevented many families from falling into poverty and helped others exit poverty during the Great Recession.
Implications: The findings provide clear, evidence-based policy recommendations. Increased federal funding for Head Start is needed to support families during a COVID-19 recession. States should supplement these allocations to expand Head Start enrollment for all eligible families.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-04-25T00:47:40.676927,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25T00:47:11.313359,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://usa.ipums.org/usa/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/citation/,zgbkr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea2428441327c001bc81e81/,5ea2428441327c001bc81e81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zgbkr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zgbkr
