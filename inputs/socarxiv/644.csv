It will discover the importance given to correct pronunciation, as well as gauging learners’ attitudes towards the possibility of introducing podcasts as a new language input tool for facilitating improvements in pronunciation. To achieve this, the previous literature in this area is reviewed, followed by presenting the results and analysing the data from an attitudinal questionnaire distributed amongst 23 Level 3 Saudi EFL learners from the department of English at Imam University.   The questionnaire is divided into two parts- one concerning proper pronunciation, and the other podcasts. The data analysis shows that the participants, in spite of the low rate of improvement in their pronunciation, have positive attitudes towards the proper pronunciation of English. This outcome is compatible with previous studies` results, which assert that having a positive attitude towards a particular language and its speakers can improve pronunciation. The students were presented with a total of five podcasts related to their speaking and listening textbook for use over an eight week period, and at the end of this time they were requested to complete the questionnaire. The findings support the usefulness of examining learners` attitudes towards new Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) applications before using them in a practical way.

However, there are controversies over the most effective instructional methods. Therefore, following a comparison group design, the present study aims to investigate the relative efficacy of two conditions of output-production task repetition on high- and low-level English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ production of speech acts. The main effects of the instructional conditions, EFL proficiency level, and the potential interaction between them are examined. Two classes of English-major students take speech act lessons involving output-generation task repetition as follows:  (1) the implicit task-repetition (ITR) group is provided with visually enhanced input plus a consciousness raising task before repeating the output-generation tasks, and (2) the explicit task-repetition (ETR) group is provided with input plus metapragmatic information before repeating the output-generation tasks. The learners’ speech act production is assessed through a written discourse completion test (WDCT) across a pretest and a posttest. The results demonstrate significant gains for both groups from the pretest to the posttest. Moreover, the ETR group significantly outperforms the ITR group in the posttest. Furthermore, EFL proficiency level is found to have a significant effect on learners’ speech act production, with high-level learners outperforming low-level learners. The results reveal no significant interaction between the effects of instructional condition and EFL proficiency level.

Based on multiple data sources (i.e. interviews, observation, questionnaires and document analysis), the study aims to highlight how Raya's multiple identities as a language learner, avid film watcher, YouTube user and online gamer, and a (non) member of a target language community have contributed to her oral proficiency in English. The study also aims to emphasize some personal attributes that Raya has as a language learner in order to uncover the factors which have assisted or hampered her acquisition of English. The main finding of the case study is that Raya's English language proficiency has been enriched because of two overriding factors: firstly, integrative motivation (i.e. her love of English) highlighted through her immersion in the target language by her online identity, films and social interaction; and, secondly, instrumental motivation (i.e. using the language as a means to academic and professional advancement) in the sense she realized English was a way of helping her to achieve her goal of leaving her hometown and studying abroad.

The main question is to identify how Arabic language influences the acquisition of do-support. The influence of L2 proficiency level in the acquisition of do-support is also addressed. The study is conducted within the perspective of Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis and Differential Markedness Hypothesis. Do-support as a marked feature of English has received little or no attention in previous work on the acquisition of English as a second language by adult Arab learners.  This study seeks to fill that gap by documenting the acquisition of do-support in negation and interrogatives. To address these aims, a written production task, a multiple-choice task and a semi-structured interview were administered to 10 adult Arab learners of low and advanced English proficiency levels. The findings indicate that the role of Arabic is noted. While not the source of errors, it acts as a strategy that adult Arab learners use to dealing with limited L2 knowledge and the markedness of do-support, which is the main source of difficulty shown by adult Arab learners. The role of learners’ L1 is selective according to the learners’ perception of what is difficult or not.  Moreover, a significant relationship was found between L2 proficiency level and the mastery of do-support in that high- proficiency learners outperform low-proficiency learners. It is recommended that future research examine the acquisition and markedness of do-support in the interlanguage of Arabic-speaking children.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic influence|do-support|L2 proficiency level|markedness,2018-07-02T10:55:09.356099,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:19:12.922563,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/citation/,d62u5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/za3fj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/relationships/node/,za3fj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5cf0ab83f6902524f9509/,58e5cf0ab83f6902524f9509,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d62u5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d62u5

All participants for the study had to underline errors and evaluate them by indicating the points from 0-5 they would deduct for each error; 5 indicates very serious errors; 0 is for error-free sentences; “1” is for errors which can easily be excused; “2”, “3”, and “4” are means to show intermediate degrees of seriousness. Results of the study show that the three academic groups differ in their evaluation of errors. Whereas the Ph.D. groups are the most lenient, the M.A. groups are the least tolerant. The non-teachers are the most tolerant of all groups.",TRUE,FALSE,|Educational attainment and ESL error evaluation|English native speakers' vs. non-natives' ESL error evaluation|error gravity,2018-07-02T10:55:09.051058,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:08:48.931206,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/citation/,bvsp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jeyf5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/relationships/node/,jeyf5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5ccbf6c613b024ffea052/,58e5ccbf6c613b024ffea052,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bvsp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bvsp2/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bvsp2

The purpose of the current study was to test the correlation between the independent variables (including, level of social media use, interactivity with peers, interactivity with teachers, active cooperative learning, engagement) and the dependent variable (i.e., learning performance) of female Saudi students in a sex-segregated educational system.  A cross-sectional survey was administered to 283 participants, representing 15.8% of the target population of female Saudi students enrolled on a distance learning course at King Abdulaziz University.  The data were analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling, to generate and validate the Social Media-Learning Performance (SM-LP) model. The SM-LP model predicted with a substantial effect size (R2 = 67.7%) that female Saudi students perceived that they could potentially improve their learning performance, in a sex-segregated education system, through high levels of social media use, stimulating inter activity with peers and teachers, as well as active collaborative learning, and engagement. All the path coefficients were statistically significant (p &lt; .05) reflecting a strong endorsement of the use of social media as an effective learning tool. The findings have important implications for sex-segregated educational context.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:55:09.014821,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:04:54.207554,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/citation/,qf9wc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dzm6t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/relationships/node/,dzm6t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5cbde6c613b0252fe9e72/,58e5cbde6c613b0252fe9e72,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qf9wc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qf9wc/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qf9wc

This study was aimed to observe and give the evidence of the use lesson study in helping the teacher to have the other’s perspective, especially in the process of teaching to strengthen their strategies and classroom management. By applying action research through plan, do, and reflective phases, lesson study was able to foster significant teaching skill to develop the quality of teaching and learning.  The average of teachers’ pedagogical competence for Language Testing Administration (LTA) was 3.33 and 2.84 for Genre Based Writing (GBW) from three cycles. The improvement of teachers’ pedagogical competence was based on their decision in adjusting the material and approach to implement a meaningful learning. It proved that students’ motivation could be optimally stimulated in joining the classroom. However, the students’ perception of teachers’ pedagogical competence was also increasing. It was believed that it was a part of teaching improvement. Therefore, it is recommended to implement lesson study for improving the quality of learning especially for its process.",TRUE,FALSE,lesson study|pedagogical competence|teaching improvement,2018-07-02T10:55:08.983064,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:01:12.202249,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/citation/,6b45h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9qv4u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/relationships/node/,9qv4u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5ca8d6c613b0251fe9ffc/,58e5ca8d6c613b0251fe9ffc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6b45h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6b45h/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6b45h
