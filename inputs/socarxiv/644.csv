Concerning education a misperception of academic ability can lead to educational misinvestment with potentially severe consequences. That is why this paper investigates if there are disparities in the ability to accurately self-evaluate school performance by social origin. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first paper considering this important research question. In doing so, the paper has two emphases: firstly, a theoretical model, arguing why disparities in the ability to accurately self-evaluate school performance by social origin are likely, is proposed and secondly an empirical study is conducted in order to examine if disparities by social origin are findable. The key results indicate that both students with less and students with highly educated parents underestimate their school performance if they have school grades higher than the average, and overestimate their school performance if they have school grades lower than the average. However, this relationship is intensified for students with less educated parents and therefore they self-evaluate their school performance

1) Individuals, their circumstances and their interactions are heterogeneous and subject to constant change;

2) Individuals and their interactions make up groups;

3) Groups are normally very stable, lacking change.

After defining social stability and reviewing current rational choice theorizing, this paper contends that neither past nor current sociological thinking sufficiently explains how social stability can come from the arbitrariness of individual interactions. It then posits that all choices have accompanying ‘entrained' choices, subsumed to conscious decision-making, one being for ‘predictability’; a ubiquitous yet useful characteristic of sociodynamics that addresses the problem above in a testable, falsifiable way, and could be a sociological ‘constant’ for use in further research.",TRUE,FALSE,Bounded Rationality|Contract Theory|Decision Theory|Entrained Choice|Predictability|Rational Choice Models|Social Choice Models|Social Interaction Models|Social Stability|Uncertainty,2018-07-02T11:28:41.923123,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-07T02:15:18.730207,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/citation/,qxkfs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/52qc9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/relationships/node/,52qc9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a28836f3ce6c0000dcd257b/,5a28836f3ce6c0000dcd257b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qxkfs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qxkfs,NA

Yet, researchers have demonstrated that even samples sourced from well-respected and widely-adopted internet platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk are often unable to screen out respondents who do not meet selection criteria requested by researchers. Here, I argue that researchers should proactively verify that third-party survey data is accurately sampled before considering it for analysis. I propose using survey “attention checks” as a methodological solution for researchers to determine whether data vendors have provided low quality data. In this short research note, I illustrate the approach by analyzing data from a consequential political opinion poll administered on behalf of an academic polling center by a third-party internet panel vendor for a special election in 2017. By assessing valid/invalid response choices of two overlapping geographic variables, I identify irregularities in the dataset that suggest that the sample included respondents who were not within the researchers’ intended sampling frame.

However, existing research offers different expectations about whether personal ties prove detrimental or beneficial for lenders. Research on embeddedness from economic sociology highlights the advantages lenders accrue when they develop personal ties with borrowers, including enhanced trust, information-sharing and greater social control. Yet research from social psychology offers reason to suspect that personal relationships can be costly because lenders who feel personally tied to borrowers run the risk of escalating commitment to poor performers. Drawing on these lines of research, this study uses data from a Latin American microfinance bank to ask: When are personal relationships detrimental or beneficial for financial intermediaries? It shows that, when lenders and borrowers have personal relationships, lenders are less likely to cut ties with poor performers and borrowers miss fewer payments, consistent with expectations from both literatures. However, these trends vary with frequency of contact. When lenders and borrowers interact less frequently, lenders continue to show heightened commitment, but borrowers become less compliant, creating potential problems for lenders. Overall, this study integrates theories from economic sociology and social psychology to offer a more balanced, temporally-informed understanding of personal ties in finance.",TRUE,FALSE,embeddedness|escalation of commitment|finance|lending|microfinance|relationships,2018-07-02T11:27:28.946103,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-06T13:26:34.173504,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/citation/,edt8g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b2vmh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/relationships/node/,b2vmh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a27e1d170a91c000f1c51e9/,5a27e1d170a91c000f1c51e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/edt8g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/edt8g,NA

Over time, this resistance led to resegregated school systems in which whites fled to private schools and public schools became majority Black. Contemporary reform efforts favor white students while resisting progression towards equity. It is through the neo-conservative movement that neoliberal reforms, such as accountability in schools and performance based funding, emerge and extend their influence to public higher education. A discussion of these neoconservative and neoliberal influences is provided as well as a call for educational reforms grounded in social justice.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.972839,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T18:06:22.595550,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,Information Age,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/citation/,7jtw9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z25ck/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/relationships/node/,z25ck,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d86f86b219000c8af59c/,5a26d86f86b219000c8af59c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtw9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jtw9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jtw9,NA

Supporters of Christian colleges describe the important role such spaces play in advancing and protecting the faith and creating a new generation of proselytizing believers (Adrian, 2003), while church officials tout the protective value of Christian colleges against the secularizing influence of higher education and for retaining young people in their denominations (Kingsriter,2007). Central to maintaining an evangelical mission is the need to carefully prescribe and enforce standards of behavior for both students and staff. For students, such standards can include signing a “lifestyle covenant,” attending religious services, following guidelines regarding interactions with the opposite sex (e.g., “visitation hours”), alcohol restrictions, learning the theology of the host denomination, and various other standards
particular to a given campus or denomination. Among these are norms and standards concerning sexual morality.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.936547,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T18:05:58.782597,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Peter Lang,2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/citation/,q6wkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ycn89/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/relationships/node/,ycn89,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d821b42121000e16338e/,5a26d821b42121000e16338e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6wkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q6wkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q6wkt,NA

Both quantitative and qualitative data are presented that suggest many in the SIG membership are unhappy with current options, distrust the process by which they were created, and feel marginalized by the organization. However, the same data include suggestions for moving forward, constructive ideas for meeting data collection needs, and meaningful commentary on the current options and processes. Based on the present data, it seems that the newly announced options are unsatisfactory to most SIG members, but there is hope for constructive dialogue toward doing better, and creating an inclusive and equitable AERA.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:27:27.901544,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-05T18:03:38.162511,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods,Research Initiative on Social Justice and Equity,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/citation/,rz5cs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e93yf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/relationships/node/,e93yf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d61cb42121000d1634d2/,5a26d61cb42121000d1634d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz5cs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rz5cs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rz5cs,NA
