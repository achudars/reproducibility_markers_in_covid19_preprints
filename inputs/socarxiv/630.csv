While we know that these data can only be
measured with error, our reliance on them implies a belief that those errors are random, or, at a minimum, unrelated to the political phenomena we use them to understand. But
that is implausible. Measuring the economy is largely a state function, and the political-economic backdrop against which it occurs inherently shapes it. The implicit belief that
the politics of data production are inconsequential to political science research should be scrutinized. We examine this belief using a newly available dataset of ex post revisions to World Development Indicators data, with a particular focus on GDP growth statistics. We find that revisions to these data reveal a form of measurement error that is both consequential—simple political economy relationships vary substantially depending on which version of the data is used—and systematic. We focus particularly on the IMF’s role in the political economy of data production, but our analysis reveals other political factors that inform the scale and direction of ex post revisions.",TRUE,FALSE,IMF|measurement|political economy,2018-07-02T11:35:28.998322,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-17T02:14:54.812270,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,Andrew Kerner and Charles Crabtree,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/citation/,qsxae,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nv9ua/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/relationships/node/,nv9ua,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5e5e65ff20fa000cec95a3/,5a5e5e65ff20fa000cec95a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsxae/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qsxae/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qsxae,NA

In this paper, we ask how professional group members maintain a positive self-perception in face of moral stigma. Drawing on pragmatic and cultural sociology, we claim that professional communities hold narratives that link various aspects of the work their members perform with specific understanding of the common good. These narratives allow professionals to maintain a shared view of their work as benefitting society and to perceive themselves as moral individuals. As a case study, we focus on the advertising industry, which has long been stigmatized as complicit in exploitative capitalist mechanisms and cultural degradation. We draw on 9 total months of fieldwork and 74 interviews across three U.S. advertising agencies. We find that advertising practitioners use narratives to present their work as contributing to the common good, depicting themselves as moral individuals who care about others in the process.

The astrobiological search for life in the universe is rarely discussed in terms of communicative first contact, a concept often reserved for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). What are the implications for astrobiology of inheriting historical conclusions that there is no value in attempting communication with seemingly non-intelligent life on Earth? By imagining a radical first contact protocol, to bridge work in astrobiology and SETI, this paper challenges the assumption that certain forms of life elsewhere (those we might categorize as like microbial, plant, insect, computer, geologic, or other non-human forms and systems) can be eliminated in advance from attempts at communicative or cultural first contact. A radical first contact protocol asks that we push the limits of both our astrobiological and anthropological imaginations beyond the traditional scope of anthropological subjects and functional SETI-focused definitions of intelligence. By drawing on anthropological theory, ontological anthropology, multispecies ethnography, decolonizing methodologies, speculative fiction, as well as from fieldwork with astrobiologists and SETI scientists (Wright and Oman-Reagan 2017), this paper proposes how and why a radical first contact protocol might approach any potential life, broadly defined, as though it is also a potential intelligence, culture, or agent inviting communicative contact and moral consideration. By drawing on expansions of contemporary anthropology along with other theory and practice this project also aims to help scientists “step out of our brains” (Cabrol 2016) to build methods and insights which successfully bridge key aspects of first contact and the search for life in astrobiology and SETI.

Using Bloom’s Taxonomy to guide question classification, we found that the teacher-generated free-response questions were 5.58 times more likely to be at the understanding level than the remembering level and 2.05 time more likely to be at the applying level than the understanding level.

However, the expected post-recession rebound in fertility rates has yet to materialize. In this study, I propose an economic explanation for why fertility rates have continued to decline regardless of improvements in conventional economic indicators. I argue that ongoing structural changes in U.S. labor markets have prolonged the financial uncertainty that leads women and couples to delay or forego childbearing. Combining statistical and survey data with restricted use vital registration records, I examine how cyclical and structural changes in metropolitan-area labor markets were associated with changes in total fertility rates (TFR) across racial/ethnic groups from the early 1990s to the present day, with a particular focus on the period between 2006-2014. The findings suggest that changes in industry composition – specifically, the loss of manufacturing and construction businesses – have a larger effect on TFR than changes in the unemployment rate for all racial/ethnic groups. Since structural changes in labor markets are more likely to be sustained over time, in contrast to unemployment rates which fluctuate with economic cycles, further reductions in unemployment are unlikely to reverse declining fertility trends.",TRUE,FALSE,Demography|Fertility|Great Recession|Labor Market Polarization|Low Fertility|Manufacturing|Race/Ethnicity|Unemployment,2018-07-02T11:34:08.997245,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-15T05:27:11.107205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Nathan Seltzer,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/citation/,vj9ge,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qde98/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/relationships/node/,qde98,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5c2d95f8a0b5000eefe32a/,5a5c2d95f8a0b5000eefe32a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vj9ge/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vj9ge/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vj9ge,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-019-00790-6

From Confucian China, across the Hindu Kush with the Indian Mahābhārata, the Bible, the Koran and the Homeric epics, to Platonic mimēsis and Shakespeare’s “borrowed feathers,” our culture was created under a fully open regime of access to pre-existing expressions and re-use. Creativity used to be propelled by the power of imitation. However, modern policies have largely forgotten the cumulative and collaborative nature of creativity. Actually, the last three decades have witnessed an unprecedented expansion of intellectual property rights in sharp contrast with the open and participatory social norms governing creativity in the networked environment. Against this background, this paper discusses the reaction to traditional copyright policy and the emergence of a social movement re-imagining copyright according to a common tradition focusing on re-use, collaboration, access and cumulative creativity. This reaction builds upon copyright’s growing irrelevance in the public mind, especially among younger generations in the digital environment, because of the emergence of new economics of digital content distribution in the Internet. Along the way, the rise of the users, and the demise of traditional gatekeepers, forced a process of reconsideration of copyright’s rationale and welfare incentives. Scholarly and market alternatives to traditional copyright have been plenty, attempting to reconcile pre-modern, modern and post-modern creative paradigms. Building upon this body of research, proposals and practice, this Article will finally try to chart a roadmap for reform that reconnects Eastern and Western creative experience in light of a common past, looking for a shared future.",TRUE,FALSE,China|Confucius|Copyright|Digital Copyright|Europe|Imitation|Intellectual Property|Plato|Reform|United States,2018-07-02T11:34:08.871314,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-15T05:24:02.709767,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c49|Law|Legal History|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c58|Law|Law and Philosophy|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/citation/,crnks,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qg9et/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/relationships/node/,qg9et,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5c13e4ff20fa000cea9b1c/,5a5c13e4ff20fa000cea9b1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/crnks/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/crnks/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/crnks,NA

In the wake of the financial crisis, public and political interest in corporate taxation rose significantly, with debt-challenged states looking to shore up national fiscal systems, and attention focused on corporate tax practices deemed overly aggressive or immoral. International tax rules as a matter of ‘front page’ public debate is an unusual situation; while taxation itself is always and everywhere a political topic, the fine workings of international taxation has largely been the domain of technical debates between experts. This is no longer the case: issues such as tax havens, transfer pricing, and structures like the “Double Irish Dutch Sandwich” have become topics of popular debates and campaigns. These issues have gone from being solely the subject of technical expert debates to being topics of public interest and popular media reporting. In consequence, new political initiatives have also progressed at an unexpectedly high pace. How has this rapid and unexpected change come about? Existing accounts of international tax change have emphasised the role played by international state relations, International Organisations’ standard-setting, the influence of transnational elites or the role of leaks in driving lawmaking. These analyses have often emphasised formal policymaking processes. Some accounts have zoomed in on the role of activists, in particular the Tax Justice Network, analysing the tactics and strategy of individual ‘outsider’ organisations in changing public and policy debates. This paper offers a complementary narrative of the dynamics of international tax change, looking at the role of various actors in shaping popular debates on international tax issues.",TRUE,FALSE,International tax|Tax,2018-07-02T11:34:08.719054,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-15T05:22:17.392295,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/citation/,kwysr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/upxb2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/relationships/node/,upxb2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5bccdbf8a0b5000fef6c5c/,5a5bccdbf8a0b5000fef6c5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kwysr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kwysr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kwysr,NA

Using the “niji VOICE 2018” survey, this study examines the association between sexual/gender minority status and earnings in Japan. The analysis shows that there is a negative association between being a sexual/gender minority and earnings among both designated females at birth and designated males at birth. The results suggesting the lesbian premium found in Western economies are not observed in Japan. The findings also indicate that the processes through which stratification based on sexual orientation and transgender status may operate depend on various categories of sexual/gender minorities such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and a Japanese local transgender category “X-gender.”",TRUE,FALSE,Earnings|Gender Identity|Japan|Labor Market|Sexual Orientation,2018-07-02T11:34:05.130362,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-13T13:35:43.815297,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/citation/,u2rh3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a59a952f8a0b5000def447e/,5a59a952f8a0b5000def447e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2rh3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2rh3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2rh3,NA
