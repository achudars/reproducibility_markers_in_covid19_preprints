We follow the classification developed by Meguid (2008) and use a probabilistic topic model approach to analyze the 300,000 speeches delivered in the Swedish parliament between 1994 and 2017. Our results indicate that immigration became a more prevalent topic in party leader debates when the Sweden Democrats entered the parliament in 2010. The other parties started to address immigration more, but still not to the extent that the Sweden Democrats did. In 2015, as Sweden faced a migration crisis, immigration became a more salient issue in the parliamentary debates. This could be seen as an external shock that forced the mainstream parties to put more emphasis on the topic of immigration. We conclude that the mainstream parties used a partly dismissive, partly adversarial strategy in their speeches when the SD entered the parliament. The migration crises in 2015 made them focus more on immigration and they thereby adopted a more adversarial strategy.",TRUE,FALSE,Party strategies|Political framing|Radical right|Swedish politics|Topic models,2018-07-02T11:48:06.646059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-04T10:30:01.620044,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/citation/,jdsqc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/32jhd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/relationships/node/,32jhd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac4954d29ad60000f3219a7/,5ac4954d29ad60000f3219a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdsqc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jdsqc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jdsqc,NA

With the multiplier a mechanism whereby debt-financed public investment generates matching private saving (net of private investment) plus public saving, it becomes possible for Keynes to conclude that increasing public debt need not place upward pressure on the level of interest rates, so long as policy can successfully manage the psychology of the debt market.

In this analysis, I estimate the impact of the changing relative size of the adult male population, classified by age and education groups, on the earnings of employed males living in 502 Brazilian local labor markets during four time periods between 1970 and 2000. The effects of shifts in the age distribution of the working age population have been studied in relation to the effect of the baby-boom generation on the earnings of different cohorts in the United States. However, the question has received little attention in the context of the countries in Asia and Latin America, which are now experiencing substantial shifts in their age-education distributions. Taking advantage of the huge variation across Brazilian local labor markets, the models in this research suggest that age-education groups are not perfect substitutes, so that own-cohort-education size depresses earnings, as expected by the theory. Compositional shifts are influential, attesting that this approach represents a fruitful way of studying this central problem in economic development, going beyond the effects normally analyzed by formal labor market equations.",TRUE,FALSE,Brasil|Brazil|Cohort size|Demografia|Demographic|Demographic change|Demographic transition|Demography|Earnings|Economic development|Educação|Education|Educational|Educational change|Educational transition|Labor market|Mercado de trabalho|Mudanças demográficas|Mudanças educacionais|Rendimento|Tamanho da coorte|Transição demográfica|Transição educacional,2018-07-02T11:48:05.915162,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-04T10:32:22.999828,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/citation/,xbzr7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g2b5j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/relationships/node/,g2b5j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac3c2dcf595fc000e6a1005/,5ac3c2dcf595fc000e6a1005,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbzr7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbzr7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbzr7,NA

(M.A. Thesis)

Since the 70’s, the Brazilian Middle-West Region has experienced an important modernization process in agricultural and industrial activities, which has led to an employment retraction and migration flows, especially from rural areas to the major metropolitan cities of the region. In this research the focus of analysis are the State of Goiás and the Federal District, which encompasses Brasília, the capital of Brazil. In order to understand the new population configuration, the region was divided into four sub-areas (micro-region of Goiânia, micro-region of Entorno de Brasília, the Federal District, and a group of 16 micro-regions of Goiás) and the patterns of migration, by age and sex, were estimated for the periods 1975-1979 and 1986-1991. In addition, differences between native and migrant population of each sub-area, according to the participation in the labor force, income, education and type of migration were investigated. The analysis was performed on the basis of the 1980 and 1991 Brazilian Census data.

In the intra-state migration, the fluxes between the micro-region of Goiânia and the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás, and between the Federal District and the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília were the most important. In the inter-state migration, the flux from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and the North region to the 16 micro-regions of Goiás, as well as the flux from Northeast, Southeast and South to the Federal District were significant. But there was a decline in the migration to the Federal District, between 1975-1979 and 1986-1991, while, in the same period, the migration to the Entorno of Brasília increased.

The chance of the migrant population in the micro-region of Goiânia and in the Federal District to have worked in the last 12 months prior to census interview was lower than that of the native population. However, those who migrated from the Federal District to the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília had higher chance to have worked in the formal sector than those who did not migrate. Migrants who moved from the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília and the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás to the micro-region of Goiânia had lower wages than the non-migrant population. The lowest level of wages was recorded for the migrants to the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás. Migrants living in the Federal District had high level of education, while those migrants living in the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília had low level of education.

In 1986-1990, the micro-regions of Goiânia and Entorno de Brasília, as well as the 16 other micro-regions of Goiás, presented a high percentage of returned migrants. In the same period, a major proportion of migrants to the micro-region of Entorno de Brasília had first moved from Southeast or from the Federal District to others regions. In addition, there was a considerable proportion of migrants with low income who had moved from Northeast to the Federal District and then to the micro-region of the Entorno de Brasília.

Future research could focus other areas or regions of Brazil, and could also explore the same kind of analysis, on the basis of the incoming 2000 Brazilian Census, which requires the development of new techniques, as it did not collect information on the city of previous residence, but only on the state of residence.",TRUE,FALSE,Brasil|Brasília|Brazil|Central-West|Centro-Oeste|Distrito Federal|Educação|Education|Employment|Emprego|Entorno de Brasília|Federal District|Goiânia|Goiás|Mato Grosso|Mato Grosso do Sul|Micro-region|Microrregião|Middle-West|Migração|Migration|Migration rate|Migration rates|Nordeste|Norte|North|Northeast|South|Southeast|Sudeste|Sul|Taxa de migração|Taxas de migração,2018-07-02T11:48:05.884391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-04T10:33:30.748695,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,05/24/2002,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/citation/,2k8rs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tqb69/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/relationships/node/,tqb69,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac3be6729ad60000f313b71/,5ac3be6729ad60000f313b71,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2k8rs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2k8rs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2k8rs,NA

Drawing on documentary sources, ethnographic fieldwork, and 52 interviews with financial economists and market participants, this article addresses this question by tracing the development and adoption of the mathematical models and associated infrastructures that derivatives ‘dealer’ banks use to assign value to the counterparty risk embedded in the ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives contracts they trade. Rather than reflecting a pre-existing consensus on the part of financial market participants in favour of valuation practices drawn from financial economics, this article suggests that the switch to fair value actively shaped the financial modelling and risk management practices used by dealers to value and manage this risk. While a number of material and institutional factors shaped the adoption of these practices, the switch to fair value ultimately ‘tipped the balance’ in favor of a particular set of practices that were preferred by a minority of investment banks. In explaining the development and adoption of banks’ counterparty risk modelling practices, this paper develops a hybrid theoretical approach that combines organisational institutionalism’s focus on meso-level field dynamics and the social studies of finance’s focus on materiality.",TRUE,FALSE,fair value|financial modelling|institutional logics|materiality|social studies of finance|valuation practices,2018-07-02T11:48:03.741459,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-02T14:00:25.269969,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c63|Law|Accounting Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Taylor C.

For this, some modifications are proposed to previous methods, in order to improve the measurement of migration rates. Other estimations were calculated with information on place of residence at some fixed date in the past. Results suggest that estimations with improved techniques using last-move data give similar results to those ones provided by techniques based on place of residence from a specified number of years preceding the Census enumeration.

Abstract: This article presents research about migratory movements in Goiás and Distrito Federal, Brazil. It synthesizes a picture of larger population attraction areas in the Centro-Oeste, Goiânia micro-regions, and Distrito Federal's Entorno. Initially, it indicates a migratory redriving to the region in the 70's, originated from capital development in agriculture, with agriculture mechanization and alteration of social relations of production. Such changes in the previous situation of population absorption, gives place to a larger worker’s flow towards the cities. The final part of the article brings a migration profile of these regions, based on literature categories for migration flows and territory redefinition both induced by agriculture modernization. Also, the authors utilize techniques of migration analyses and compare trends of the two fundamental areas with data of 16 Goiás micro-regions.

Resumo: O artigo trata dos movimentos migratórios em Goiás e no Distrito Federal, sintetizando o panorama que se forma nas áreas de maior atração de contingentes populacionais na Região Centro-Oeste, as microrregiões de Goiânia e Entorno do Distrito Federal. De início, localiza nos anos setenta um redirecionamento migratório na região, decorrente do desenvolvimento do capital na agricultura, que mecaniza lavouras e altera as relações sociais de produção. O predomínio no período anterior, da absorção de excedentes populacionais de outras regiões, dá lugar, nos anos seguintes, a um maior fluxo de trabalhadores em direção às cidades. Na última parte, os autores traçam um perfil da migração nas regiões estudadas, recorrendo a classificações da literatura para fluxos migratórios e a redefinições do território provocadas pela modernização agrícola. Também sustentam o estudo, técnicas de análise de migração e comparações das tendências nas duas áreas principais com os dados das 16 microrregiões de Goiás.",TRUE,FALSE,Brasil|Brasília|Brazil|Center West|Center-West region|Central West|Central-West|Central West region|Central-West region|Centro-Oeste|Distrito Federal|Federal District|Goiás|Migração|Migration|Modernização|Modernization|Região Centro-Oeste,2018-07-02T13:32:15.220587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-01T14:36:31.254305,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/citation/,g6ak2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qwhpd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/relationships/node/,qwhpd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abff31d266c2a000dc550a0/,5abff31d266c2a000dc550a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ak2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ak2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ak2,NA
