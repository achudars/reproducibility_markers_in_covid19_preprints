Yet, such participation is challenging as lower-level employees typically lack the resources for participation, such as requisite strategy knowledge. Drawing on a practice-theoretical perspective on resources and data from a longitudinal, ethnographic case study of a participative strategy process in a large insurance company, we examine the dynamics of participation of lower-level employees. In particular, we identify a recursive relation between participation and the enactment of resources.

New knowledge, based on the tweets and collegial online interactions from the 14,183 tweets sent by the HEIs in the US, UK, Canada, and South Korea, not only promotes the HEIs' unique online persona, but captures the very essence of leadership under investigation. Distinct leadership styles are separated into any one of the twenty-one administrative activities, which I constructed. Further, the learning opportunities and outcomes, associated with either managerial and non-managerial functions, culminate as the distinguishing features of online leadership. Contextual analysis has been applied to navigate the open conversations and the interactions taking place to categorize and measure the impact of the leadership in the ongoing practice of DL as a demonstrative theory.

Organizations use experiments to test new strategies in a low stakes setting. Yet organizations also use experiments to evaluate managers who will implement these strategies \emph{online}. I develop a formal model to demonstrate that these two types of evaluation are fundamentally incompatible. Managers who fear replacement in response to a poor offline outcome will pervert their experiments to maximize the likelihood that they succeed. This saps offline experiments of much of their informational value. I show that if an organization can observe a manager's experimental strategies and the experiment's outcomes \emph{and} can commit ahead of time to an evaluation and replacement rubric, then it can resolve this principal-agent problem. However, if a manager's experimental strategy cannot be credibly communicated, and thus are evaluated solely based on experimental outcomes, the organization faces two risks in its effort to promote effective offline experiments. If the organization replaces managers based on their offline outcomes, then it risks replacing good managers. If the organization never replaces managers, then it risks retaining bad ones. I demonstrate that when experimental outcomes are more certain, replacing managers based on observed offline outcomes produces the best results.

As interest in and adoption of ALCs has increased rapidly over the last decade, the need for grounded research in their effects on learners and schools has grown proportionately. In this paper, we review the peer-reviewed published research on ALCs, dating back to the introduction of “studio” classrooms and the SCALE-UP program up to the present day. We investigate the literature and summarize findings on the effects of ALCs on learning outcomes, student engagement, and the behaviors and practices of instructors as well as the specific elements of ALC design that seem to contribute the most to these effects. We also look at the emerging cultural impact of ALCs on institutions of learning, and we examine the drawbacks of the published research as well as avenues for potential future research in this area.",TRUE,FALSE,Active learning|Active learning classroom|Architecture|Learning spaces,2018-10-19T16:11:41.730456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T16:11:11.335024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5e|Education|Higher Education|Scholarship of Teaching and Learning|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/citation/,vg2mx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4kpmn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/relationships/node/,4kpmn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc9fc59c339920019d8c406/,5bc9fc59c339920019d8c406,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vg2mx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vg2mx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vg2mx,NA

It is suggested that information on the number of children, structural and associational intergenerational solidarity can be utilized to operationalize the continuum. Subjective wellbeing is utilized as outcome of interest.  
Data from waves 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe are used. The sample includes 183,545 respondents from 21 countries. Linear regression models with clustered standard errors are used. 
Childless older individuals report lower levels of life satisfaction than parents. However, the largest difference is observed between those with one and two children. Using a measure of associational intergenerational solidarity to weight the degree of parenthood it is shown that parents who have infrequent contact with children report significantly lower levels of life satisfaction than childless individuals.
Kinless-ness is not only a demographic but also a social condition. When studying the consequences of ageing alone it is essential to consider not only the presence and “quantity” of kin, but also its “quality”.",TRUE,FALSE,childless|childlessness|Europe|family|fertility|kinlessness|parenthood,2018-10-19T16:09:24.979189,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T16:09:07.626771,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/citation/,xtfq6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nmzsx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/relationships/node/,nmzsx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc9d96e6a9364001a6c1744/,5bc9d96e6a9364001a6c1744,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xtfq6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xtfq6,NA

It does so through utilising a future-orientated lens to sketch out the kinds of work required to reimagine, reframe and remake smart cities. I argue that, on the one hand, there is a need to produce an alternative ‘future present’ that shifts the anticipatory logics of smart cities to that of addressing persistent inequalities, prejudice, and discrimination, and is rooted in notions of fairness, equity, ethics and democracy. On the other hand, there is a need to disrupt the ‘present future’ of neoliberal smart urbanism, moving beyond minimal politics to enact sustained strategic, public-led interventions designed to create more-inclusive smart city initiatives. Both tactics require producing a deeply normative vision for smart cities that is rooted in ideas of citizenship, social justice, the public good, and the right to the city that needs to be developed in conjunction with citizens.",TRUE,FALSE,citizenship|future|right to the city|smart cities|social justice,2018-10-19T13:10:01.214675,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T13:09:41.438501,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/citation/,5jkx4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/phbak/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/relationships/node/,phbak,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc8a40511fd9d0017957c68/,5bc8a40511fd9d0017957c68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jkx4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5jkx4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5jkx4,NA
