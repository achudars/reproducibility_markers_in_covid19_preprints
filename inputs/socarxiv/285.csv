However, social scientific interest in alienation had become parochial and balkanized by the 1970s. To reconstruct a unifying theory of alienation that addresses general features of capitalism, such as compulsory growth and commodification, and particular phases like financialized capitalism, we begin with the notion of futurelessness. Futurelessness refers to a deficient relationship to the future in which people’s senses of possibility ossify or dissipate. It may result from inclusion in and exclusion from capitalist mechanisms or processes. Moreover, processes of inclusion and exclusion may appear more voluntary or involuntary. With these general terms, we identify four manifestations of futurelessness in financial capitalism: commercial exhaustion, imaginative marginalization, therapeutic nowism, and pragmatic denialism. The conclusion addresses future-sustenance in an alienating world and the prospects of a more systematic and synthetic approach to alienation.",TRUE,FALSE,Alienation|Capitalism|Financialization|Future|Phenomenology|Possibility|Social Theory|Systems|Temporality,2019-11-27T11:15:41.891434,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-27T11:15:24.491724,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Kelly Nielsen; Tad Skotnicki,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/citation/,jkstw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dddd7b8e1e62f000c2c335a/,5dddd7b8e1e62f000c2c335a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkstw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jkstw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jkstw,NA

It uses the same methodological procedures and applies them to a for-profit, general interest firearm magazine that has been continuously published for 65 years: Guns magazine. Like the earlier study, we hypothesize that the center of gravity in US gun culture has evolved over time from “Gun Culture 1.0,” the historic gun culture of hunting and recreational shooting, to “Gun Culture 2.0,” America’s contemporary defensive gun culture, an evolution reflected in the content of gun advertisements. The data show that the predominance of Gun Culture 1.0 themes in advertising persists through the 1980s and into the 1990s, when the center of gravity of gun culture begins to shift decisively toward the Gun Culture 2.0 themes of personal protection/self-defense and concealed carry. This trend continues through the 1990s and 2000s, with the two emphases crossing-over in the 2010s.

As such, it resembles a sexual activity. OM is taught as a practice that is distinct from sex, and we wondered whether people who engage in OM actually maintain that distinction themselves. We conducted an online convenience sample survey including qualitative open-ended text questions and quantitative Likert-style questions that was distributed to email listservs for practitioners of OM. The 30-item questionnaire included questions designed to differentiate the potentially related concepts of OM, seated meditation, fondling, and sex, as bases for comparison. The quantitative results of this mixed method study show that OM practitioners view the practice as significantly more similar to meditation than to sex or fondling. These results were consistent, regardless of whether the question was asked in the positive or negative and whether OM was being compared to one behavior individually or to multiple behaviors at the same time. The distinction between OM and sex/fondling rapidly becomes more pronounced as practitioners complete more OMs. This suggests that the novelty of genital touching in meditation may diminish over time, as practitioners get used to the more alternative point of focus.

In addition to agricultural intensification,  the flexibility of subsistence strategies seems to have played an important role.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|bell beaker|prehistory|resilience|settlement|subsistence,2019-11-25T23:00:01.385578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-25T22:59:39.641062,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/citation/,pf3dx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ddbd9d6215a8f000b4f46e6/,5ddbd9d6215a8f000b4f46e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pf3dx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pf3dx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pf3dx,NA

In light of the assumption that inspectors must follow specific rules instead of ambiguous guidelines, such as precluding collective action, to decide what and when to delete, this study attempts to offer a dynamic understanding of censorship by exploiting well-structured Weibo data from before and after the 2018 Taiwanese election. This study finds that inspectors take advantage of time in handling online discussions with the potential for collective action. Through this deferral tactic, inspectors make online sentiments moderately flow regarding an important political event, and thereafter, past discussions on trendy topics will be mostly removed. Therefore, reality is selectively altered; the past is modified, and the future will be remembered in a ``preferable"" way.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-11-28T20:31:03.547529,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-28T20:30:44.776289,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/citation/,whe5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ddbacd2fbde36000a919ab8/,5ddbacd2fbde36000a919ab8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/whe5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/whe5x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/whe5x,NA

Eleven (11) nurses working for at least three (3) years from three (3) selected hemodialysis units within Metro Manila participated in this study. Multiple face to face in-depth interviews, story-telling sessions and non-participatory observation were utilized to create the individual narratives from where the patterns and expressions of caring were later explicated. 
After a series of content analysis following the focused ethnography design, three patterns and expressions of caring were then identified: (1) being at the moment, (2) transcending perceived boundaries and (3) harmonizing with technology. These patterns represent for informants their unique expressions of caring in the context of working in a hemodialysis unit. It reflects a moment to moment transitioning between caring for and caring with persons thru technology.
Insights from this study suggest that the nature of caring as articulated by the informants is an expression of their anticipated role as career within the moment and their perceived image of the person being cared for. 
Professional role clarification, fluency in communication and technological competency training were implied as possible ways of strengthening their perception of being caring which in the end could improve patient outcomes. Further studies exploring the nature and process of image representation of persons being cared for is implied since there seems to be a consistent dilemma among the informants of the blurring of their professional roles as nurses and their personal boundaries as a human person.",TRUE,FALSE,caring|focused ethnography|hemodialysis|Philippines|technology,2019-11-25T22:53:02.744352,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-25T22:52:51.475809,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/citation/,eyfmc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ddb30e96fc769000cd71ca3/,5ddb30e96fc769000cd71ca3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eyfmc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eyfmc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eyfmc,NA
