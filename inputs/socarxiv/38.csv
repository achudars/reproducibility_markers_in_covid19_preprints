Furthermore, they are highly susceptible to environmental, social, and economic pressures such as climate change, cyclical pandemics, market disruptions, and diminishing arable land. These issues are also becoming increasingly vital in dint of the fact that population growth is placing increasing pressure on sustainable priorities. However, a recent scientometric review indicates a significant paucity in the extant literature on agriculture projects, with a pressing need for further research to examine sustainable project management practices from an institutional perspective. This research, therefore, aims to respond to this gap in the literature by drawing on Institutional Theory through a multi-case study of Agriculture Co-operative Institutions (ACIs). These are often viewed as valuable vehicles to deliver agricultural projects which can benefit communities, especially in emerging markets. Initial findings from two rounds of fieldwork as well as an extensive literature review suggest that ACIs as value-based organisations embedded within institutional contexts help stimulate elements of agility in project management processes, to deliver sustainable outcomes for their members and external stakeholders. Agile ACI project managers can also stimulate innovative outcomes across broader sustainable agriculture projects. It is the aim of this research also to undertake a larger cross-country comparison with international research cases. Therefore, this study will aim to not only contribute to critical project management discourse and knowledge but also to uncover agile project management practices for future pressing policy development and implementation to help foster greater sustainable agriculture project processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Agile|Agriculture|Coop|Co-Operative|Institutional Theory|Project Management|Sustainability|Sustainable,2021-04-10T21:06:05.259320,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-10T21:05:52.104719,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/citation/,v4je2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6071b417f6585f042b6124af/,6071b417f6585f042b6124af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4je2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v4je2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v4je2,NA

In order to initiate such a debate, it is necessary to uncover what has been guiding public discourse and in particular public debate about human genomics and gene editing. Moreover, it is also necessary to understand the grounds upon which human genomics is being currently governed. The authors present an assessment of citizen engagement on debates about human genomics, identifying common problematics found in different studies. The lack of citizen engagement activities about human genomics thus far suggest that there is a need to create opportunities for debate about this technology and its potential applications. This will constitute a necessary next step on the research about social and ethical implications of human genomics. In light of this, the authors set forth seven thematic narratives enshrined in policy and media discourses, as well as human genomics practices. These narratives come from different actors and are telling about on-going promises, assumptions, claims, interests, expectations and concerns across the human genomics field. The narratives can function, firstly, as a means to introduce or trigger the conversation in the desired topics through the exploration of the plausibility and desirability of such narratives from the point of view of the relevant actors, and secondly, to gather insights of the imaginaries and expectations of citizens related to the discourses on human gene editing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-10T21:05:02.523849,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-10T21:04:34.535383,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/citation/,fmgc5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6071a7a3f6585f0420617aa9/,6071a7a3f6585f0420617aa9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmgc5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fmgc5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fmgc5,NA

Working-class men without a college degree suffered the most. Some argue that economic dislocation caused stress and despair, leading to adverse health behavior and ill health (dislocation-despair approach). Others suggest that hazardous drinking inherited as part of a dysfunctional working-class culture and populist alcohol policy were the key determinants (supply-culture approach). We enter this debate by performing the first quantitative analysis of the association between economic dislocation in the form of industrial employment decline and mortality in postsocialist Eastern Europe. We rely on a novel multilevel dataset, fitting survival and panel models covering 52 towns and 42,800 people in 1989-1995 in Hungary and 514 medium-sized towns in the European part of Russia. The results show that deindustrialization was significantly associated with male mortality in both countries directly and indirectly mediated by adverse health behavior as a dysfunctional coping strategy. Both countries experienced severe deindustrialization, but social and economic policies seem to have offset Hungary’s more immense industrial employment loss. The policy implication is that social and economic policies addressing the underlying causes of stress and despair can improve health.",TRUE,FALSE,deaths of despair|deindustrialization|health inequality|Hungary|mortality|multilevel modeling|postsocialist mortality crisis|Russia|survival analysis,2021-04-10T21:00:24.945759,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-10T20:59:55.447310,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/citation/,jpbct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60715b0f51f7ae03f3f51c4c/,60715b0f51f7ae03f3f51c4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jpbct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jpbct/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jpbct,NA

In contrast, our synthesis asks why peer review is used ubiquitously and why it works despite such deficits. Historically, one answer lies in peer review not just providing expertise-based decisions on scientific resources (publication space, funding, jobs), but also providing an organized procedure to give these decisions legitimacy outside of science, e.g. in politics. The current situation is marked by a landscape of national and international funding and review activities that not only complement each other, but overlap, mirror, or rival each other. The current challenge rests in adapting peer review to different funding programmes within this landscape and without adding unnecessary burden on researchers and research organisations. To capture these aspects of scientific self-governance, we suggest an alternative conception of grant peer review that allows for thinking about peer review procedures as made up of different elements. Our key findings from such a conception are the following:
- Peer review procedures have become more complex and formalized, as a result of being adapted to the different settings in publishing, funding, and hiring, on the national and international level. 
- The diversity and ubiquity of peer review rests upon its adaptability and scalability in reaching the ‘right’ decisions, i.e. based on scientific exellence, as well as in producing legitimate decisions, i.e. accepted by multiple stakeholders.
- Peer review can be partitioned into eight elemental practices: four essential practices – postulating, consultative, decisive, and administrative – and another four – debating, presenting, observing, and moderating – that provide further combinatorial possibilities.
- Through context-specific combinations of these elemental practices into a procedure, peer review generates legitimacy for judgements on scientific quality, inside and outside of science.
- Peer review should not be seen as a 'measurement device' for scientific quality. Its diversity attests to the fact that issues of quality and legitimacy are intertwined and should be addressed openly.
- Peer review procedures can act as laboratories for deliberation where the robustness and validity of research are equally relevant issues as participation, representation, accountability, or legibility; in effect, allowing for experiments and innovations in science policy.",TRUE,FALSE,peer review,2021-04-09T14:52:41.193059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-09T14:52:02.034238,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/citation/,nzsp5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60705e0af2ad3303e5a74d57/,60705e0af2ad3303e5a74d57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzsp5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nzsp5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nzsp5,NA

Consequently, punishment allows cooperators to happily match each other (conditionally cooperate), confident that they will not be exploited by non-cooperators. However, it is not clear that punishment is altruistically motivated, and previous experiments have confounded a fear of being punished with being surrounded by cooperators. Here, we experimentally decouple the fear of punishment from a cooperative environment and allow cooperation and punishment to freely separate (420 participants). We show, that if a minority of individuals are made immune to punishment, they (1) learn to stop cooperating despite being surrounded by high levels of cooperation; and (2) continue to punish, ‘hypocritically’, showing that cooperation and punishment do not form one, altruistically motivated, linked trait. Overall, 48% of punishers were ‘anti-social’ during the experiment, suggesting humans are not in general altruistic punishers.",TRUE,FALSE,altrusim|conditional cooperation|norm enforcement|public goods game|social preferences|strong reciprocity,2021-04-09T19:42:02.303579,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-09T19:41:41.886747,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/pdjqm/,no,"We submitted an ethics application to the HEC-LABEX ethics committee.

Previous research suggests that school exclusion during childhood is a precursor to social exclusion in adulthood. Past literature on the consequences of school exclusion is, however, scarce and mainly focused on short term outcomes such as educational attainment, delinquency, and mental health in early adolescence. Moreover, this evidence is based primarily on descriptive and correlational analysis, whereas robust causal evidence is required to best inform policy.
Aims. We aimed to estimate the mid-to-long-term impact of school exclusion on labour market and economic outcomes.
Sample. The sample included 6632 young people who at the age of 25/26 in the year 2015 participated in the Next Steps survey of whom 86 were expelled from school and 711 were suspended between the ages of 13/14 and 16/17.
Method. Using high quality existing longitudinal data, we utilised four approaches to evaluate the impact of school exclusion: logistic regression-adjustment models, propensity score matching, school fixed-effects analysis, and inverse propensity weighting. The latter two counterfactual approaches were used to estimate causal effects.
Results. We found that school exclusion increased the risk of becoming NEET at the age of 19/20, and then remaining economically inactive at the age of 25/26, as well as experiencing higher unemployment risk and earning lower wages also at the age of 25/26.
Conclusion. School exclusion has pervasive negative effects into adulthood. Policy interventions should focus on both prevention and mitigating its negative effects. Interventions aimed at re-integrating excluded individuals into education or vocational training could be key in reducing the risk of poor socio-economic outcomes and social exclusion.",TRUE,FALSE,inverse probability treatment weighting|NEET|propensity score analysis|school exclusion|unemployment,2021-04-09T11:47:43.909812,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-09T11:47:09.861041,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be access from here: https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5545 after previous registration and approval,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/citation/,wjr3f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8c6rz/,8c6rz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60703a0cf6585f03b261912e/,60703a0cf6585f03b261912e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjr3f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wjr3f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wjr3f,NA

Vacation dedication is a form of enthusiasm for and devotion to going on vacation. It is an enduring urge to go on vacation that is so strong that it persists in spite of external constraints. We empirically test its links to the well-established constructs of travel involvement, commitment, and tourist identity. Affective commitment emerges as most strongly associated with vacation dedication, pointing to an important emotional component.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-09T08:34:23.863559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-09T08:31:53.593900,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/citation/,wsj6c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606fd4ccf2ad3303b1a774c3/,606fd4ccf2ad3303b1a774c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsj6c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wsj6c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wsj6c,https://doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2019.1678572
