This provides a test of the accuracy of typical address based geocoding methods used in crime analysis, as well as provides evidence for how much accuracy one gains when using sensors. Examining over 1,000 shooting incidents in Wilmington, North Carolina, we find that the majority of address-based incidents are quite accurate, on average within 60 feet of the actual location (using a street centerline geocoder), or within 90 feet (using Google rooftop geocoding). However, based on the incident narrative we identify a subset of transcription errors in over 10% of the cases that increases the distance between the true shooting location and that geocoded using address data. This suggests mechanisms to prevent human errors may be more frugal than those relying on sensors in geocoding shooting incidents.

In this paper, I clarify these terms in a positive critique of the current state of the field. I then consider the ways in which the proposed framework can help analysts to bridge the divide between economics and sociology. Armed with techniques derived from formal network analysis, the new economic sociology offered the first sustained foray into economic territory, but sociological skeptics remain unsatisfied. Two broad rejoinders to this network-analytic approach emerged in the last two decades, but both correctives, nevertheless, leave the divide intact. In the last decade, however, a new paradigm is coalescing under the rubric of “relational economic sociology. While showing promise, it furthers the confusion surrounding the key concepts of “relations” and “relationships.” The proposed framework provides a foundation for constructive dialogue among the different traditions which constitute this new paradigm.",TRUE,FALSE,economic sociology|relational sociology|relational work,2019-04-17T23:01:47.086861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T23:01:15.064400,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/citation/,rfeqs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb75a0039926900181661ac/,5cb75a0039926900181661ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rfeqs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rfeqs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rfeqs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-017-9336-2

The article maps out the terrain of diversity discourses, both as a specific type of discourse and as an example of ethical, moral and pragmatic modes of argumentation. The author examines Swedish ""diversity discourses"" in the periods of 1968-1975 and 1991-1995 in an effort to tease out the pragmatic, moral and ethical aspects of these discourses. Diversity discourses are defined as discourses regarding how much and what kind of diversity is acceptable or desirable in a society, as well as how such diversity should be handled. I find that values, both contextually-dependent ethical values and universal moral values, rather than being ""prior"" to politics, arise out of the intersection of pragmatic, ethical and moral discourses. What is moral and ethical, then is colored by the particular nexus of moral, ethical and pragmatic concerns such that what is acceptable at one particular time and location, may be unacceptable in another, even coming from the same actors with the same ideological commitments.

The scholarship on radicalism largely portrays radical discourse as opposition to powerful ideas and enemies, but radicals often evince great interest in personal and local concerns. To shed light on how radicals use and adopt rhetoric, we analyze an original corpus of more than 23,000 pages produced by Afghan radical groups between 1979 and 2001 using a novel computational abductive approach. We first identify how radicalism not only attacks dominant ideas, actors, and institutions using a rhetoric of subversion, but also how it can use a rhetoric of reversion to urge intimate transformations in morals and behavior. Next, we find evidence that radicals’ networks of support affect the rhetorical mixture they espouse, due to social ties drawing radicals into encounters with backers’ social domains.

The current literature is divided on this issue. One line of reasoning suggests that aid is likely to decrease violence by improving employment and prosperity, thereby making participation in conflict more costly. Another view cites evidence showing an association between aid projects and increased insurgent activity. Addressing this contradiction, we argue that different types of aid projects lead to different outcomes, as some projects foster an unequal distribution of benefits within communities. Our reasoning draws on qualitative accounts from conflict zones, recent research on how grievances associated with exclusion can foster civil war onset, and experimental findings regarding perceived inequity and punishment. Building on this scholarship, we use a recently developed event-matching methodology to offer insight from contemporary Afghani- stan. Aid projects that tend to exclude portions of the community yield more insurgent activity in their wake than more inclusive projects. These results shed light on why some aid projects reduce violence while others do not, emphasizing that efforts to ‘win hearts and minds’ can be a source of both contentment and contestation.",TRUE,FALSE,Afghanistan|development aid|event analysis|exclusion|grievances|insurgency|matching,2019-04-17T13:40:41.841159,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:39:43.995114,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/citation/,6ea2r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/avntx/,avntx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb69c40353c58001b9e7c3b/,5cb69c40353c58001b9e7c3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ea2r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ea2r,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343318777566

But, how do people “bind” otherwise discrete elements as a single element? In cognitive neuroscience and the philosophy of mind, this is known as the “binding problem.” Sociologists can learn from research on binding, as it deepens our understanding of cultural objects, learning, and social change. Binding is the process by which a material “token” is assimilated into (or expands the boundaries of) a cognitive “type,” or resists such typification thereby leading to the formation of a new cognitive “type.” Cultural objects are simultaneously types and tokens, and the interplay between them results in a fundamental cultural instability. “Binding” is an attempt to stabilize meaning in two ways: the first, innovating, is implicated in the emergence of a cultural object, and the second, indexicalizing, in its maintenance and extension. However, even the process of indexicalizing a well established type—i.e., the proliferation of tokens—provides the material fodder from which to innovate new types. Attention to binding processes in the production and reception of cultural objects reveals important insight into the dynamics of cultural change and stability.",TRUE,FALSE,art|cognition|cultural objects|culture|fuzzy sets|neural binding,2019-04-17T13:40:01.865847,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:39:06.749901,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/citation/,4cvr7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb644f63992690017120858/,5cb644f63992690017120858,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4cvr7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4cvr7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4cvr7,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.01.005

Explaining the Use of Facebook News Posts as a Substitute for Other News Sources,"An increasing number of, especially younger, users use Facebook as their primary source for news about political and societal issues. At the same time, research suggests that Facebook use contributes to societal knowledge gaps. Against this background, we investigate the antecedents of using Facebook as a substitute for other news sources. We argue that exposure to news posts on Facebook increases the feeling of being well-informed, regardless of actual knowledge acquisition. This might lead users, especially those with a low need for cognition (NfC), to use Facebook as a substitute for other news sources. We test these assumptions with an online survey (n = 390) of German Internet users. Results show that the feeling of being well-informed through Facebook is reinforced by the quantity of exposure to news content on Facebook but not by the amount of actually read news posts. The feeling of being informed is an important predictor of using Facebook news as a substitute. High NfC interferes with this effect. It makes the substitution of other news sources less likely—but only for moderate to high levels of the feeling of being informed. We discuss these results in the light of their societal consequences.",TRUE,FALSE,Facebook|Feeling of Being Informed|Need for Cognition|News Exposure|Substitution,2019-04-17T13:39:27.908432,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:38:09.993222,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,Philipp Müller|Svenja Schäfer|&amp; Pascal Schneiders,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/citation/,cjz54,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb6273d3992690018152062/,5cb6273d3992690018152062,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cjz54/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cjz54,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.003

Evidence from the German Family Panel,"A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalanced local sex ratios are correlated with social consequences, including the pattern and timing of union formation, fertility and relationship stability. Scholars have argued that these findings can be understood as a result of imbalances in the bargaining power the respective sex holds in male- or female-skewed regions, but they remain vague on the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the literature implicitly considers individual partner market experiences to be a function of local sex ratios. However, empirical evidence on the correspondence between subjective partner availability and local sex ratios remains scarce. This study addresses this gap by linking individual-level German longitudinal survey data (pairfam) with local sex ratios from population data for different entities (states, counties, and municipalities). Using multilevel regression models, this paper analyses the correlations between a subjective partner market indicator and a variety of local sex ratio measures. Moreover, an event history analysis explored how either indicator relates transitions into relationships. Results revealed that none of the local sex ratio measures, including those for narrow age ranges and/or lower level administrative entities, significantly predicted whether individuals predominantly met individuals of their own sex. Event history models yielded significant correlations between this subjective partner market indicator and relationship formation for both genders, substantiating the validity of the subjective indicator. For local sex ratios, results revealed an additional association between local sex ratios and female relationship formation when the sex ratios were adjusted for age hypergamy. Male relationship formation was uncorrelated with any local sex ratio. Both evolutionary and social scientific reasoning on the consequences of sex ratio imbalances rest on assumptions of subjective partner availability that may not be adequately represented by local sex ratios. Future research should be careful not to equate local sex ratios and conscious partner market experiences.",TRUE,FALSE,mating|pairfam|partner market|relationship formation|sex ratio,2019-04-17T13:38:28.219770,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17T13:36:59.085763,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/citation/,vs9r3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb5d0f4f2be3c001602c477/,5cb5d0f4f2be3c001602c477,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vs9r3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vs9r3,NA

One longstanding difficulty in the U.S. has been the extreme lack of guidance on how courts are to determine a litigant’s ability to pay. The result has been a seat-of-the-pants approach that is inefficient and inaccurate, and, as a consequence, very socially costly. Fortunately, online platform technology presents a promising avenue for reform. In particular, platform technology offers the potential to increase litigant access, reduce costs, and ensure consistent and fair treatment—all of which should lead to more accurate sanctions. We use interviews, surveys, and case-level data to evaluate and discuss the experiences of six courts that recently adopted an online ability-to-pay assessment tool that streamlines and standardizes ability-to-pay determinations. Our findings suggest that the online tool improves accuracy and therefore the effectiveness of fines as punishments, and so it may make the use of fines as sanctions more socially attractive.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-04-16T17:32:47.480495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-16T17:32:09.743227,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0f|Law|Public Law and Legal Theory|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c36|Law|Courts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4f|Law|Law and Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",Meghan M.
