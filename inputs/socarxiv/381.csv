It also evaluates the use of Gaelic words referenced to Caithness within Gaelic areas south and west of Caithness. As a result of this investigation a number of features emerged.  Firstly, there are a high number of Gaelic words present in Caithness Scots.  Secondly, the borrowing appears to have been one way as there didn’t appear to be much borrowing from Caithness Scots into local Gaelic. Thirdly, an intriguing question arose, although out with the focus of this study, that the language boundaries apparent from terrestrial place names may not be coincident with the boundaries of names of features pertaining to the sea.

The aim of this study is to evaluate how homeownership is associated with parity-specific birth. We use the 2009-2017 waves of the Korea Labor and Income Panel Study (n=6,934) to illustrate opt-out childbearing without the state of being a homeowner. This study uses the Cox proportional hazard model to show mutually-exclusive patterns between homeownership and childbearing. The results suggest that either short-term rent or home-ownership is negative to have a first child while only home-ownership is negative to have a second child. Also, rural areas show a slightly faster path in having a second child.

Yet, the impact of such recommendation algorithms on how we consume and perceive news is still understudied. We therefore developed one of the first software solutions to conduct studies on effects of news recommender systems in a realistic setting. The web app of our framework (called 3bij3) displays real-time news articles selected by different mechanisms. 3bij3 can be used to conduct large-scale field experiments, in which participants’ use of the site can be tracked over extended periods of time. Compared to previous work, 3bij3 gives researchers control over the recommendation system under study and creates a realistic environment for the participants.

Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli’s ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs’s figure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric.

To meet this aim, our design and results will be explained from a study carried out with the participation of a sample of university students from the Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche (Spain) in 2018.

In contrast to previous studies, the model relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price.",TRUE,FALSE,convertible arbitrage|convertible bond|convertible underpricing|default probability approach|default time approach|hybrid financial instrument|jump diffusion,2019-10-01T02:47:25.746407,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-30T20:13:17.003943,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/citation/,gxwaj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d911522d55120001b5c6d28/,5d911522d55120001b5c6d28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gxwaj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gxwaj,NA

Previous studies report conflicting evidence: some find that gender-diverse firms experience more positive performance and others find the opposite. However, most research to date has focused on a single country or industry and has not accounted for possible variation across social contexts. This paper advances an institutional framework and predicts that gender diversity’s relationship with performance depends on both its normative and regulatory acceptance in the broader institutional environment. Using a unique longitudinal sample of 1,069 leading public firms around the world, I find that the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance varies significantly across countries and industries due to differences in institutional context. The more gender diversity has been normatively accepted in a country or industry, the more gender-diverse firms experience positive market valuation and increased revenue. These findings underscore the importance of the broader social context when considering the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-29T21:35:02.232097,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29T20:30:25.158299,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Letian Zhang,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/citation/,8792m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d90d1a5c43280001dc8585f/,5d90d1a5c43280001dc8585f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8792m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8792m,NA

Early selfies were often taken with webcams hooked up to desktop computers and are more stationary in character. They are taken within the home, within the intimacy of the living room or bedroom, and mostly focus exclusively on the photographer’s face. But the prevalence of camera- and internet-enabled smartphones has brought the selfie into the outside world. A selfie today is as much about the photographer’s surroundings as it is about the photographer themselves. Considering how selfies are intricately linked with various social media platforms, the selfie cannot be considered to be just a visual object or cultural representation. Instead, of just being a cultural product, the selfie is intricately tied up in producing social media culture . Selfies are viewed, ‘liked’, commented on and shared onwards by followers and friends on social media platforms as well as by more traditional media. Since smartphones have enabled the selfie to untether itself from the living room webcam, naturally the geography of the selfie and how it produces representations of places becomes an important and intriguing subject. This amplified further by the fact that many selfies are explicitly geotagged. That is, users of social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter choose to add a specific geographic location to the selfie they are uploading. With this implicit indication that the location of that photo is somehow important, we ask ‘what is the geography of the selfie?’.

To answer these questions, this article uses a global dataset of geotagged selfies posted to Twitter since the summer of 2012 (cf. Poorthuis et al., 2016). By matching based on keywords and hashtags related to selfies, a dataset of ~10 million tweets and their corresponding images is extracted. The empirical section on the article consists of two parts. In the first part, characteristics of these selfies are compared with random samples that represent all tweets and all tweets with images attached, respectively. These datasets are mapped and visualized to analyze the geographic distribution of selfie production.",TRUE,FALSE,selfie|Twitter,2019-09-29T21:28:23.129009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29T20:29:04.150693,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/citation/,uw954,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d90be81c43280001cc64633/,5d90be81c43280001cc64633,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uw954/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uw954,NA
