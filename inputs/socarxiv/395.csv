Applying Social Network Analysis, this study revealed a participation gap among students reflected by their varied levels of network prestige. The low-prestige group initiated equivalent volumes of interactions but were less reciprocated. In-depth analysis found the high-prestige group also advantageous in other network measures such as closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality, as well as the strength, persistence, and reciprocity of their ties. To probe potential explanations of the revealed gap, we further contrasted post content and posting behaviors between two groups. Results did not identify any significant differences in post content but found low-prestige students’ participation less timely and more temporally compressed.

In these circumstances, inter-generational reproductive conflicts between younger and older females are predicted to resolve in favor of the younger females, who realize fewer inclusive fitness benefits from ceding reproduction to others. This conceptual model anticipates that immigrants to a community initially have few kin ties to others in the group, gradually showing greater relatedness to group members as they have descendants who remain with them in the group. We examine this prediction in a cross-cultural sample of communities, which vary in their sex-biased dispersal patterns and other aspects of social organization. Drawing on genealogical and demographic data, the analysis provides general but not comprehensive support for the prediction that average relatedness of immigrants to other group members increases as they age. In rare cases, natal members of the community also exhibit age-related increases in relatedness. We also find large variation in the proportion of female group members who are immigrants, beyond simple traditional considerations of patrilocality or matrilocality, which raises questions about the circumstances under which this hypothesis of female competition are met. We consider possible explanations for these heterogenous results, and we address methodological considerations that merit increased attention for research on kinship and reproductive conflict in human societies.",TRUE,FALSE,Descent|Dispersal|Kinship|Life History Theory|Reproductive Conflict|Residence,2019-03-19T14:22:44.701417,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-19T13:38:34.310433,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/citation/,xjb7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h8cqr/,h8cqr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8fbd404712b400183b30b4/,5c8fbd404712b400183b30b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xjb7c/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xjb7c

Others point out that local populations domesticate global cultural elements by integrating them into preexisting cultures, generating hybridized systems. In the current study, I argue that local cultures are not necessarily impediments to cultural change and hybridization is only one aspect of cultural domestication. Instead, I find that individuals attribute global norms to local cultural objects as a means for disassociating putatively universal norms from the powerful actors that dominate international politics. I illustrate this process using the case of support for shariʿa (sometimes called Islamic law) in majority‐Muslim countries. Results of multimethod analyses show that with the exception of attitudes about gender roles and sexuality, Muslims who support implementing shariʿa do not systematically object to many so‐called global norms; in fact, they may express more enthusiasm about democracy, tolerance for people of other religions, optimism about scientific advances, and concern for environmental preservation than those who oppose implementing shariʿa. Likewise, many Muslims assert their full participation in global society on terms not dictated by Western actors by repackaging ostensibly universal norms as components of the unambiguously local shariʿa.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural change|global society|local culture|MENA|shari'a|symbolic boundaries,2019-03-19T14:29:41.885455,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-19T13:40:33.340360,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology,Brandon Gorman,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/citation/,fmvpe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8fb30c4712b400183b25b8/,5c8fb30c4712b400183b25b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fmvpe/,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12482,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fmvpe

Numbers revealing a gender gap in research are periodically reported by national and international institutions but data on perceptions of gender equality within the research community are scarce. In the present study, a questionnaire based on the British Athena Survey of Science, Engineering and Technology (ASSET 2016) was distributed among researchers working in Spain. Consistent with the original UK-based study, women in research perceived a greater degree of gender inequality than men. This difference was consistent from junior to senior positions, within public and private universities as well as research centres, and across all research disciplines. When responses were compared with the existing UK-based questionnaire, researchers in Spain felt that women and men are treated more equally in the workplace, yet they perceived their home departments to be less supportive regarding matters of gender equality. The results of this study provide clear evidence that men and women do not share the same perceptions of gender equality in science and that their differing perceptions are relatively consistent across two major European countries. The fact that men occupy the majority of senior positions while not perceiving the same inequality as women do, may be critical when it comes to ensuring the fair ascent of women to senior positions in an academic system.

We challenge Garrison’s assertions that non-binary individuals reproduce the gender binary in that they are more likely than binary trans individuals to use essentialist narratives to construct their gender identity. Due to Garrison’s criteria for participation in his study, all participants identified as trans and were in the process of transitioning. However, not all non-binary individuals identify as trans and consequently Garrison’s theorizing from a small sample of trans identified non-binary folks is problematic. We argue that the small sample size and Garrison’s recruitment strategy do not capture the wide range of individuals who identify as non-binary and that this small sample is not enough for Garrison to generalize about non-binary identified folks. Gender identity is a complex issue and while we commend Garrison for his contribution to the field, we argue that such work should be done with diligence as to ensure that research does not render identities invisible in early attempts to theorize with small samples.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|gender|gender essentialism|genderqueer|gender social structure|non-binary|trans|transgender,2019-03-17T21:00:03.480496,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-17T20:59:35.746856,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/citation/,4usqt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8ea39a80f5d2001883d249/,5c8ea39a80f5d2001883d249,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4usqt/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4usqt

A Field Study Examining Religiosity and Social Capital in Tunisia,"The present study sheds light upon critical factors that help explain the entrepreneurial success among Muslim women living in a democratic Tunisia, a Muslim-majority country considered by many to be the lone Arab Spring success story. We hypothesized that successful entrepreneurs need social capital, including the capital that comes from marriage and high levels of wasta (the Arabic concept of having personal connections with influential others). Moreover, given the lack of empirical attention paid to the role of the culture, language, and customs associated with Islam on women’s empowerment, we examine whether religiosity is related to entrepreneurial performance among Tunisian women. Data collected with 84 female entrepreneurs participating in entrepreneurship training programs across Tunisia reveal that two forms of social capital, marital status and wasta, are related to training center directors’ ratings of women entrepreneurs’ performance, suggesting that social capital is a critical asset for Muslim women entrepreneurs. Religiosity, on the other hand, had no statistically significant relationship with entrepreneurial performance. Our study contributes to research on entrepreneurship by identifying wasta as a form of social capital that may be necessary for women entrepreneurs to succeed in the Middle East and North Africa and by taking an initial step towards better understanding the empirical (and controversial) relationship between religiosity and career success among Muslim women. We recommend that training organizations supporting entrepreneurs directly assist women in the development of social capital and acknowledge, rather than ignore, that nepotism and wasta are linked to entrepreneurial success in some cultures.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab world|entrepreneurs|human capital|Islam|marital status|religiosity|self-employment|social capital|spirituality|Tunisia|wasta,2019-03-16T20:13:49.639382,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16T20:13:23.176080,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology,Lisa Baranik|Brandon Gorman|and William J.
