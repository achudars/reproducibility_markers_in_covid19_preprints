For children and young adults, a story is a discursive space where they find answers, solutions, and ideas. Contrastingly, to adult writers, it is a space dedicated to promoting ideological beliefs and values to young readers. Thus, this study attempts to investigate the problematic representation of Arab city and village families found in two children stories written by American author Elsa Marston (1933-2017). She classifies families into two opposing extremes; the civilized city families and the poor, conservative village families. Using Edward Said’s Orientalist discourse analysis, alongside David Spurr’s rhetorical trope of Classification, the researcher explores how and why Jordanian and Egyptian families are classified with disregard to cultural differences. The analysis reveals that Arab families, both Jordanian and Egyptian, are equally classified based on education, social class, and culture. City families are viewed as developed due to their interaction with the west, whereas village families are portrayed as ignorant and uncivilized for their lack of communication with the west. The analysis also detects the author’s negative attitude towards village families.",TRUE,FALSE,children’s literature|colonial enterprise|Egyptian families|Elsa Marston|Jordanian families|orientalism|representation,2019-09-04T02:36:45.689130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:36:28.551575,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/citation/,yqw6v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee4887215100019a1a3b8/,5d6ee4887215100019a1a3b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqw6v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yqw6v/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yqw6v

The study aims at detecting and shedding some light on translation’s problems that the translator face when translating political texts. The results of the study indicate that built-in-language repetition exists in the Arabic translated text, and the use of repetition, in general, is more frequent in Arabic.

In both short stories, the central characters Louise Mallard and Jane, undergo an essential journey of self-realization, which leads them to finally freeing themselves from patriarchal authority and oppression. Moreover, the paper stresses the impact of the authors as females on their characters’ development throughout that journey. Following the analytical approach within the feminist theory, the article is influenced by two major feminist critiques; Virginia Woolf and Simone De Beauvoir, who believed that women should incorporate their voices into their writings to depict more realistic female characters. Finally, both characters rejected being subordinate and oppressed and formed a reaction against it.

Thus, the colonized country becomes torn between former traditions and newly modern perspectives. In this respect, the focus of this research paper will fall over as it witnessed Western imposition over its society that tried, in its turn, to maintain a traditional lifestyle, while there were attempts for change. Hence, the researcher attempts to shed light on Jordan-as it sways between traditions and imposed reforms- through the literary work of Fadia Ahmed Faqir, whose main motivation resides in the strong messages she conveys in her novel The Cry of the Dove. Thus, the concern of this paper is how far carrying a double identity affects people’s sense of belonging? In this respect, the article introduces a hint of the author’s life embodied in the protagonist Salma, who carries a swaying identity torn between tradition and modernity through her adventures.  Salma moves forward and backward through time, then she- the protagonist-wins a voice in a foreign country and adopts a new standard of living, releasing herself from the cultural boundaries of Jordan. Salma is naïve but loses her original identity while she had an opportunity to be a wife, with her husband who travels to provide for his family. But she flies to Britain rejecting the double life she leads between her traditional and modern habits.

Such coverage is not only conveyed by the media and newspaper articles, but also by creating novels. As a result, the current study focuses on the concept of extremism. The hallmark of this study is to illustrate how such concept is ideologically embedded within a text. Thus, this study is confined to Don DeLillo's Falling man (2007). In this novel, DeLillo describes the trauma caused by 9/11 attacks. It is important to note that he  recruits his language to mirror Islam as an extreme religion.  To access the concept of extremism in this novel, the researchers will apply a critical stylistic approach. Therefore, the analysis will  depend heavily on the textual conceptual model that is represented by Jeffries (2010) to uncover the hidden ideologies related to extremism. The aims of current study is to investigate the way the linguistic meaning is used as a vehicle for constructing the ideology of extremism in the selected novel; in addition to identify the textual meaning that underlies extremism in the selected novel.  With the aid of critical stylistic tools, the researchers find out that DeLillo employs the use of certain linguistic choices in his novel.

As for silence in literature, it offers the example in which silence is not only present and comprehended but also a substantial part of communication that encapsulate a sender and a receiver. In novels, it is considered as a new humanistic tactic through which a writer would force the reader to feel words rather than reading them plus more intensity and strength. Novelists tend to use silence in writing their novels as it is an integral part of voices and a revelation of so many hidden things, but it mistakenly might be understood as a refusal for communication.

The study addresses the following research questions: what are the linguistic, social-cultural, mistrust and communication-related barriers that are encountered by interpreters and language assistants in conflict zones, how do they cope with these challenges, and what could be done to train them to handle such challenges and difficulties. The study adopted a qualitative methodology with semi-structured interviews being the main method of data collection. Twenty participants agreed to voluntarily take part in the investigation by allowing face-to-face interviews. Interview data was transcribed, coded and analyzed thematically. The results of data analysis showed that participants faced a range of challenges that negatively affected their job. They reported difficulties understanding and dealing with some social and cultural issues specific to the region. They also reported some serious life-threatening incidents ranging from physical and verbal attacks. For example, interpreters encountered hostilities from their fellow citizens accusing them of siding with enemy parties involved in the conflicts. Additionally, communication barriers were reported by participants as being the most salient challenge they experienced even when they interpreted accurately, as they would still encounter communication breakdowns caused by the inherent differences in the indigenous languages and varieties in addition to some cultural barriers. The paper offers some insights and implications for the conflict zones’ interpreters’ training and professional development.",TRUE,FALSE,challenges|conflict zones|interpreter training|professional development|Sudan,2019-09-04T02:43:01.210762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:42:39.889734,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/citation/,e84gm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6edc1580f9b50018641795/,5d6edc1580f9b50018641795,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e84gm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e84gm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e84gm

Bucke and Schleiermacher cited three forms of consciousness: Animal or Brutish Self-awareness, Sensual or Self-Consciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness. While examining the poetry of indigenous people, Palestinians and Native Americans, we find out that the majority moves within the confines of the Sensual or Self-Consciousness in their reaction to the brutish consciousness of the oppressors who deny their unalienable rights for life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Unlike others, Mahmoud Darwish, the Palestinian, and Joy Harjo, the Native American, attempt to transcend the sensual consciousness and adopt a broader universal vision or cosmic consciousness; however, their peaceful vision is often shattered by bitter realities and frustrated by the inhuman conduct of their oppressors. In their verses, the particular or the sensual is not completely overlooked or concealed. It is always there, yet alleviated by a universal vision held by the two poets",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-04T02:43:21.032453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04T02:42:58.930534,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/citation/,z9wxe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ed8c67215100019a19a92/,5d6ed8c67215100019a19a92,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9wxe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z9wxe/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z9wxe
