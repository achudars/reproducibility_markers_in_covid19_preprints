Not since the Spanish Flu in 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic and this has motivated many countries across globe to take a series of unprecedented actions in an effort to curb the spread and impact of the virus through the adoption of unprecedented domestic and international travel restrictions as well as stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. Whether these policies have altered criminal activity is an important question. In this study, we examine officially recorded violent crime rates for the month of March and April, 2020, as reported for the state of Queensland, Australia. We use ARIMA modeling techniques to compute six-month-ahead forecasts of common assault, serious assault, sexual offense and domestic violence order breach rates and then compare these forecasts (and their 95\% confidence intervals) with the observed data for March and April 2020. We conclude that by the end of April, rates of common, serious and sexual assault had declined to their lowest level in a number of years, and for serious assault and sexual assault the decline was beyond statistical expectations.

The Household Budget Analogy and Public Support for Austerity,"Public opinion on complex policy questions is shaped by the ways elites simplify the issues. Given the prevalence of metaphor and analogy as tools for cognitive problem-solving, the deployment of analogies is often proposed as a tool for this kind of influence. For instance, a prominent explanation for the acceptance of austerity is that voters understand government deficits through an analogy to borrowing by households. Indeed, there are theoretical reasons to think that the household finance analogy represents a most likely case for the causal influence of analogical reasoning on policy preferences. This paper examines this best-case scenario using original survey data from the United Kingdom. In both observational and experimental analyses we find no evidence of a causation running from the household analogy to preferences over the government budget.

Quantum measure is three-dimensional, both universal as the Borel measure and complete as the Lebesgue one. Its unit is a quantum bit (qubit) and can be considered as a generalization of the unit of classical information, a bit. It allows quantum mechanics to be interpreted in terms of quantum information, and all physical processes to be seen as informational in a generalized sense. This implies a fundamental connection between the physical and material, on the one hand, and the mathematical and ideal, on the other hand. Quantum measure unifies them by a common and joint informational unit. Furthermore the approach clears up philosophically how quantum mechanics and general relativity can be understood correspondingly as the holistic and temporal aspect of one and the same, the state of a quantum system, e.g. that of the universe as a whole. The key link between them is the notion of the Bekenstein bound as well as that of quantum temperature. General relativity can be interpreted as a special particular case of quantum gravity. All principles underlain by Einstein (1918) reduce the latter to the former. Consequently their generalization and therefore violation addresses directly a theory of quantum gravity. Quantum measure reinterprets newly the “Bing Bang” theories about the beginning of the universe. It measures jointly any quantum leap and smooth motion complementary to each other and thus, the jump-like initiation of anything and the corresponding continuous process of its appearance. Quantum measure unifies the “Big Bang” and the whole visible expansion of the universe as two complementary “halves” of one and the same, the set of all states of the universe as a whole. It is a scientific viewpoint to the “creation from nothing”.",TRUE,FALSE,Einstein|general relativity|measure|quantu gravity|quantum information|quantum mechanics,2020-05-13T14:17:43.047505,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-13T13:29:39.918545,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/citation/,smqgj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebb84b70238a9004d33f5a1/,5ebb84b70238a9004d33f5a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/smqgj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/smqgj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/smqgj,NA

These interruptions in formal in-person educational experiences caused adverse consequences on school-age children’s academic outcomes. Using a pre-existing database, we calculated changes in children’s reading ability without formal education (i.e., the summer months). The resultant models predicted that the rate of reading ability gain in kindergarten children during COVID-19 school closures without formal in-person education will decrease 66% (2.46 vs. 7.17 points/100 days), compared to the business-as-usual scenario, resulting in a 31% less reading ability gain from 1 January 2020 to 1 September 2020. Additionally, the model predicted that kindergarten children who have books read to them daily would have 2.3 points less loss (42%) compared to those who do not, who are predicted to have a 5.6-point loss during the same time period. Even though reading books to children will not substitute the critical role of formal education in teaching children how to read, families, educators, and policy makers can promote this simple strategy to facilitate and maintain reading ability gain during school closures, which may be a common occurrence as nations see the public health benefits of physical distancing for the current and future pandemic outbreaks.",TRUE,FALSE,book|children|closure|covid-19|education|literacy|loss|pandemic|parent|reading|school|student,2020-05-13T11:57:13.654097,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-13T11:56:10.732228,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/dataproducts.asp,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d54|Education|Elementary Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/citation/,nbv79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebb6642ec5a98005f23fc6f/,5ebb6642ec5a98005f23fc6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nbv79/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nbv79,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176371

Several contingency plans warned police to expect a large and potentially overwhelming increase in demand from the public during a pandemic, but (to the author's knowledge) there is no empirical work on police demand during a major public-health emergency. This study used calls-for-service data from ten large cities in the United States to analyse how calls for service changed during the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, compared to forecasts of call volume based on data from previous years. Contrary to previous warnings, overall the number of calls went down during the early weeks of the pandemic. There were substantial reductions in specific call types, such as traffic collisions, and significant increases others, such as calls to dead bodies. Other types of call, particularly those relating to crime and order maintenance, continued largely as before.

While most theorists use figures of some kind, few if any have formal training, or guiding rules or principles for the representation of theory. This has often led to poor visualization efforts, and the visual culture of sociology continues to lag behind the natural sciences. The intent of this paper is to serve as a practical and empirically aided guide for social theorists, by providing insights surrounding the cognitive and perceptual properties of certain elements and figures. Through these properties we identify four major problems in theory visualization: vagueness, reduction, unwanted spatial inferences and unwanted metaphorical inferences. We offer solutions to these problems, and to improving theory visualization more generally. Our hope is that this paper will serve as a resource for more thoughtful and informed visualization for practicing social theorists.",TRUE,FALSE,cognition|diagrammatic communication|sociological theory|theory figures|visual representations,2020-05-13T11:53:00.960298,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-13T11:52:11.934540,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/citation/,r9y2e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebb0fe8ec5a98005223f294/,5ebb0fe8ec5a98005223f294,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r9y2e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r9y2e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r9y2e,NA

In this manuscript, we develop a theoretical model of cultural schemas that is better able to support empirical work, including inferential, sensitizing, and operational uses. We propose a multilevel framework centered on a high-level definition of cultural schemas that is sufficiently broad to capture its major sociological uses but still sufficiently narrow to identify a set of cognitive phenomena with key functional properties in common: cultural schemas are socially shared heuristic representations deployable in automatic cognition. We use this conception to elaborate the main theoretical properties of cultural schemas, and to provide clear criteria that distinguish them from other cultural or cognitive elements. We then propose a series of concrete tests empirical scholarship can use to determine if these properties apply. We also demonstrate how this approach can identify potentially faulty theoretical inferences present in existing work. Then, moving to a lower level of analysis, we elaborate how cultural schemas can be algorithmically conceptualized in terms of their building blocks. This leads us to recommend improvements to methods for measuring cultural schemas. We conclude by proposing fruitful sensitizing questions for future scholarship.",TRUE,FALSE,automatic cognition|cognitive sociology|connectionism|cultural schemas|Marr's levels,2020-05-12T20:07:01.902796,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-12T20:06:43.306804,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Andrei Boutyline|Laura Soter,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/citation/,ksf3v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebaf57f0238a900353370f2/,5ebaf57f0238a900353370f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksf3v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ksf3v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ksf3v,NA
