Visions of the future are omnipresent in current debates about the digital transformation. This introductory article and the full special issue are concerned with the function, power, and performativity of future visions and how they relate to the making and governing of digital technology. Revisiting existing concepts, we particularly discuss and advance the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries. In difference to ephemeral visions and partisan ideas, imaginaries are collectively held and institutionally stabilized. Nonetheless, we hold that they are multiple, contested and commodified rather than monolithic, linear visions of future trajectories enacted by state actors. Introducing and summarising the articles of the special issue, we conclude that imaginaries are increasingly dominated by technology companies who not only take over the imaginative power of shaping future society. They also partly absorb public institutions’ ability to govern these very futures with their rhetoric, technologies and business models.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-25T05:20:41.408904,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-25T05:20:27.420903,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,Astrid Mager|Christian Katzenbach,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/citation/,zhjwk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f43b0f6bacde8020033b923/,5f43b0f6bacde8020033b923,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhjwk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zhjwk/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820929321,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zhjwk

This paper argues that historical political conflicts can affect political behavior over several generations when they trigger an enduring organizational mobilization. It studies how the oppression of German Catholics in the 19th century led to a regionally differentiated mobilization of political Catholicism that still affects political support for the radical right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) today. Using newly collected data on historical oppression events, it shows that Catholic regions where oppression was intense saw greater mobilization of Catholic lay organizations than Catholic regions where oppression was milder and show lower support for the AfD today.

We investigate people's perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania, during the lockdown period (April 2020) and during the state of alert period (July 2020), by fielding two surveys with different modes of collection (CATI and web). Building on measures tested in other countries, we identify the public’s vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we check if individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations.
We find in both surveys that holding conspiracy beliefs is a mediator between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn can reduce compliance with guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences. These findings highlight the potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic and can inform official communication strategies meant to counter both disinformation and non-compliance with public health policies.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-24T11:49:40.791499,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-24T11:49:18.335671,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Vlad Achimescu,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/citation/,bu45a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4380daf579150187ea5d5d/,5f4380daf579150187ea5d5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bu45a/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bu45a

Our aim is to explore the intersection between FOSS and computational reproducibility. We begin by situating FOSS in relation to other ``open'' initiatives, and specifically open science, open research, and open scholarship. In this context, we argue that anyone who actively contributes to the research process today is a computational researcher, in that they use computers to  manage and store information. We then provide a primer to FOSS suitable for anyone concerned with research quality and sustainability --- including researchers in any field, as well as support staff, administrators, publishers, funders, and so on. Next, we illustrate how the notions introduced in the primer apply to resources for scientific computing, with reference to the GNU  Scientific Library as a case study.

Developing new strategies to mentor your research trainees in remote work environments will not only support research productivity, but also help to keep your mentees’ academic and research careers on track. We describe a three-step process grounded in reflective practice that research mentors and mentees can use together to reassess, realign and reimagine their mentoring relationships to enhance their effectiveness, both in the current circumstances and for the future. Drawing on evidence-based approaches, a series of questions for mentees around documented mentoring competencies provide structure for remote mentoring plans. Special consideration is given to how these plans must address the psychosocial needs and diverse backgrounds of mentors and mentees in the unique conditions that require remote interactions.",TRUE,FALSE,advisor|graduate|mentor|mentoring|psychosocial,2020-08-24T11:47:43.395373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-24T11:47:29.033762,FALSE,NA,no,This essay does not include description of original quantitative or qualitative data,,no,Not applicable for this essay,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/citation/,efgh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f417896f5791500fbea682b/,5f417896f5791500fbea682b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/efgh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/efgh8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/efgh8

We carry out the research by relying on status characteristics theory, which is tested via a factorial survey experiment of 2,098 associate and full-time professors employed in Italian public universities in 2019. This is one of the few experiments of the hiring process in academia conducted on a nationally representative population of university professors. Our article focuses specifically on three academic disciplines: humanities, economics, and social sciences. The results indicate that female academics in Italy are penalized for co-authoring. They receive less favorable evaluations of their competence, but only when the evaluator is a male. This gender bias is most pronounced in economics, a discipline where conventions of co-authorship allow for more uncertainty on individual contributions to a joint publication. Overall, the results partially confirm our postulates based on status characteristics theory.",TRUE,FALSE,academia|factorial survey experiment|gender bias|status characteristics theory,2020-08-24T07:59:51.735310,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-24T07:59:22.689634,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/citation/,dzk45,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f410a21f5791500f1ea6973/,5f410a21f5791500f1ea6973,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzk45/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dzk45/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dzk45
