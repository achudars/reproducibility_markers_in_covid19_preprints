This can negatively affect data quality, leading to less detailed and/or inaccurate activity reporting as the surveyed time period unfolds. However, it can also be argued that data quality may actually improve over time as respondents become more familiar with the diary instrument format and more interested in the diary task. These competing hypotheses have only been partially tested on data from paper and telephone-administered diaries, which are traditionally used for large-scale data collection. Less is known about self-administered modes that make use of new technologies, despite their increasing popularity among researchers. This research note rectifies this omission by comparing diary quality in self-administered web and app diaries, drawing on data from the Millennium Cohort Study. We construct a person-level data quality typology, using information on missing data, episode changes, and reporting of key daily activity domains. Results show significant mode differences on person-level data quality, after controlling for characteristics known to influence diary mode selection and data quality. App diarists were more likely to return two diaries of inconsistent quality.

From a sociological perspective, innovations and developments of both mass media and symbolically generalized media shape the structure of social contacts. Concerning the nexus between globalization and communication, I distinguish three analytically distinct yet partially overlapping phases of globalization: In a first phase, communication became universal by incorporating the globe into networks of exchange, power and belief. In a second phase, communication became instantaneous by means of telecommunication. In a third phase, increasing differentiation within subsystems of society created incentives to communicate across the globe. In their combination, these processes have resulted in the fusion of horizons of meaningful action into a singular global frame of reference.

A renovate analysis conducted during my PhD on part of the finds and excavation reports, brought to attention new details of material and architectural culture and therefore to the formulation of different observations on the site and on the structures previously recognized.
This poster will briefly outline the main features of the site with particular attention to the first water system, the so-called cylindrical pool, dated back to the 10th century BC and its contents. A conspicuous group of artifacts, dated between the eighth and sixth centuries BC, has in fact been found as fragmentary in the same spot of the pool, suggesting perhaps not a simple accumulation.

A Quantitative Analysis of the Scientific Literature,"Introduction: Since 2016, “fake news” has been the main buzzword for online misinformation and disinformation. This term has been widely used and discussed by scholars, leading to hundreds of publications in a few years. This report provides a quantitative analysis of the scientific literature on the topic published up to 2020.
Methods: Documents mentioning the keyword “fake news” have been searched in Scopus, a large multidisciplinary scientific database. Frequency analysis of metadata and automated lexical analysis of titles and abstracts have been employed to answer the research questions. 
Results: 2,368 scientific documents mentioned “fake news” in the title or abstract, published by 5,060 authors and 1,225 sources. Until 2016 the number of documents mentioning the term was less than 10 per year, suddenly rising from 2017 (203 documents), and steadily increasing in the following years (477 in 2018, 694 in 2019, and 951 in 2020). Among the most prolific countries are the USA and European countries such as the UK, but also many non-Western countries such as India and China. Computer Science and Social Sciences are the disciplinary fields with the largest number of documents published. Three main thematic areas emerged: computational methodologies for fake news detection, the social and individual dimension of fake news, and fake news in the public and political sphere. There are 10 documents with more than 200 citations, and two papers with a record number of citations (Alcott &amp; Gentzkow, 2017; Lazer et al., 2018).
Conclusions: Research on “fake news” keeps on the rise, with a marked upward trend following the 2016 USA Presidential election. Despite having been the subject of debate and also criticism, the term is still widely used. A strong methodological interest in fake news detection through machine learning algorithms emerged, which – it can be argued – can be profitably balanced by a social science approach able to unpack the phenomenon also from a qualitative and theoretical point of view. Although dominated by the USA and other Western countries, the research landscape includes different countries of the world, thus enabling a wider and more nuanced knowledge of the problem. A constantly growing field of study like the one concerning fake news requires scholars to have a general overview of the scientific productions on the topic, and systematic literature reviews can be of help. The variety of perspectives and topics addressed by scholars also means that future analyses will need to focus on more specific topics.",TRUE,FALSE,disinformation|fake news|literature review|misinformation,2021-03-11T10:53:24.854796,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T10:52:54.920599,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/citation/,buemr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6049c1f7474b1e0028cad073/,6049c1f7474b1e0028cad073,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/buemr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/buemr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/buemr,NA

We suggest this may be because the corporate organizational form is viewed as inappropriate for social activism in general and/or because a particular campaign or organizational action is viewed as hypocritical. To test these ideas, we conduct three studies. In the first study, we examine subject ratings of 90 real-world corporate social movement campaigns and show that subjects support campaigns that involve nonprofit or public organizations, which are of an appropriate organizational form, and penalize campaigns that are inconsistent with the firm business practices, which may be seen as hypocritical. In a second study, we experimentally validate these effects by directly manipulating appropriateness of organizational form and hypocrisy of organizational action. We show that benefit corporations (B Corps) do not suffer from the same hypocrisy penalty in donation and recruitment as do other for-profit corporations, evidencing an interaction between organizational form and action. In a third study, we show that firm collaboration with a social movement organization (SMO) reduces the inappropriateness penalty, while collaboration with an SMO that has organizational practices consistent with the campaign issue reduces the hypocrisy penalty.",TRUE,FALSE,benefit corporation|corporate political activity|corporate social responsibility|cross-sector collaboration|hybridity|NGO|nonmarket strategy|nonprofit organization|organizational form|organizational identity|social movements|stakeholder theory,2021-03-11T10:54:04.489764,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T10:53:39.202833,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e10|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Public Relations and Advertising|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/citation/,p8gqz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6049bb03b57c9c002b8060c9/,6049bb03b57c9c002b8060c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8gqz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p8gqz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p8gqz,NA

I find that mask mandates have a positive average treatment effect of 3% on consumer spending. I then use survey data to confirm the mechanism: people tend to feel more comfortable participating in the economy when mask-wearing is common. Finally, I provide an estimate of the increase in tax revenue state and local governments can expect to receive as a result of implementing a mask mandate, finding a mask mandate can offset a substantial portion of the pandemic-induced decline in tax revenue.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-12T00:09:01.337073,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-12T00:08:31.670919,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/prosser-cathey/Mask-Mandates-and-Consumer-Spending,no,I did not preregister as I first wrote this paper as a class assignment.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/citation/,nyv6q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6049aa23474b1e0028ca7c48/,6049aa23474b1e0028ca7c48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nyv6q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nyv6q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nyv6q,NA

This research was necessitated by consistent poor performance of students in agriculture subject in the national examination, Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE). The aim was to determine and compare the achievement of students in PBL and LTM. Quasi-Experimental design, following a Non-equivalent Control Group Pre-test-Post-test was adopted. PBL was the treatment, while LTM group was control. All the students of agriculture and teachers of agriculture formed the target population. Stratified random sampling was used to sample 12 schools. Six schools were subjected to PBL while the other six schools followed LTM. The sample size was 484 Form Two agriculture students and 12 teachers of agriculture. Data were collected through agriculture achievement test. Descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyse the data. The results established that PBL has the greatest potential in improving students’ achievement in agriculture compared with LTM. The PBL method significantly (p&lt;.05) improved the student performance in agriculture. A statistically significant difference was found between students of PBL and LTM. The effects of PBL were more noticeable, therefore, the results are robust enough to inform practicing teachers to adopt PBL method because it has demonstrated its effectiveness in delivering content. The results may inform education experts at tertiary institutions and universities in Kenya on the benefits of implementing PBL method to pre-service teachers.",TRUE,FALSE,Agriculture Achievement Test|Lecture Teaching Method|Poor Performance|Problem Based Learning|Students Achievement,2021-03-11T10:54:43.366195,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T10:54:09.311947,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/citation/,7v9hw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60499712474b1e0020ca6670/,60499712474b1e0020ca6670,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7v9hw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7v9hw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7v9hw,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.186

In this hierarchical order, needs in five groups are physiological needs, safety needs, belonging and love needs, esteem needs and self-actualisation needs. Nowadays, it is not difficult to observe that human life has undergone a radical metamorphosis with digital transformation. With the cultural transformation triggered by digital technologies in the postmodern world, Maslow's theory has been transformed. In light of all this, in this study, based on Maslow's transforming hierarchy of needs pyramid, it is aimed to reveal academician perceptions about the use of Web 2.0 tools. The study was conducted with a case study, one of the qualitative research methods. A case study is an empirical research method used, where more than one source of evidence or data is available. The study group of the research consists of 20 academicians working in different departments of a government state university. Academist perceptions’ interview form for ‘Use of Web 2.0 tools through the needs hierarchy of Maslow, which was developed by the researcher as a data collection tool’, was used in the research. The relevant form consists of demographic and open-ended questions. As a result, it has been observed that the views obtained from academics generally meet Maslow's Digital Needs Pyramid.",TRUE,FALSE,Academist Perceptions|Case Study|Maslow’s Needs Hierarchy|Web 2.0 Tools,2021-03-11T10:59:42.584952,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T10:59:31.061093,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/citation/,kar5n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60499422474b1e0028ca35c8/,60499422474b1e0028ca35c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kar5n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kar5n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kar5n,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.185
