Agent-based models, which emphasize how actions by individuals combine to produce global patterns, provide a convenient framework for developing quantitative models of historical social processes. However, being derived from computer science, the method remains largely specialized in archaeology. In this paper and the associated tutorial, we provide a jargon-free introduction to the technique, its potential and limits as well as its diverse applications in archaeology and beyond.

We are concerned about the design, analysis, reporting and reviewing of quantitative IS studies that draw on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). We observe that debates about misinterpretations, abuse, and issues with NHST, while having persisted for about half a century, remain largely absent in IS. We find this an untenable position for a discipline with a proud quantitative tradition. We discuss traditional and emergent threats associated with the application of NHST and examine how they manifest in recent IS scholarship. To encourage the development of new standards for NHST in hypothetico-deductive IS research, we develop a balanced account of possible actions that are implementable short-term or long-term and that incentivize or penalize specific practices. To promote an immediate push for change, we also develop two sets of guidelines that IS scholars can adopt right away.",TRUE,FALSE,experiment|null hypothesis significance testing|positivist research|p-value|quantitative research|statistics|survey,2019-05-27T12:51:47.055009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-27T12:51:31.672548,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/citation/,5qr7v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2gkcs/,2gkcs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce7b54023fec40017e910e3/,5ce7b54023fec40017e910e3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qr7v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5qr7v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5qr7v

Data were collected by interviewing children in their homes. Children chose eight toys from a tailored catalog and explained why they wanted those particular items. Toys were analyzed with the aid of a framework designed to test their functional manipulation potential. The children's reasoning was analyzed by means of inductive content analysis. Two kinds of values were found: (1) those which reside in the toy itself and (2) those which children give to toys.

This qualitatively oriented paper explores 3‐ to 6‐year‐old Finnish children’s perceptions of ubicomp and IoT via interviews and a design task. Initially, the children were skeptical toward the idea that tangible objects, such as toys, could be computer and/or Internet enabled. However, these perceptions were subject to change when children were introduced to a scientific conception of what computers and the Internet are and asked to apply their knowledge to a technological design task.

Such scripts are amplified by a context in which a version of Islamic family law that envisions women as primarily domestic and men as household authorities and breadwinners has been institutionalized. However, this vision is also being challenged by women’s increasing educational attainment as well as competing egalitarian discourses of gender in Islam. The gendered religious scripts used by Muslim couples compensate for social changes that threaten to reshape both domestic and public life. I propose that how Muslim men and women talk about their marriages and households has become a key mechanism for accomplishing modern Muslim gender identities in a context where men’s authority is at risk.

We suggest that Lizardo’s (2017) discussion of three modes of culture (declarative, nondeclarative, and public) help us to understand the separate contributions of observation and interviews, with ethnographic interviews an especially helpful means of accessing different cultural modes. e also argue that Lizardo’s conception of public culture should be divided into meso and macro levels, and that this division helps to show the differing contributions of interviews within and without an ethnographic context. Developing our argument with data from the second author’s ethnographic research and analysis of other scholars’ ethnographies, we show how research that uses ethnographic interviews can help sociologists better understand how these four cultural modes interact.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural sociology|culture|ethnographic methods|ethnography|interview methods|interviews|methodology|methods|sociological ethnography|sociological interviews|sociological methods|sociology,2019-05-23T21:21:45.129075,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23T21:21:18.420463,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/citation/,87n34,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce70b6123fec40017e8791a/,5ce70b6123fec40017e8791a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87n34/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/87n34/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/87n34

A vibrant and diverse Indonesian women’s movement arose in the 1990s and played an important role in the democracy movement. Since then, women’s rights activists have achieved some crucial reforms, but have also confronted unprecedented and complex challenges—notably, the rise of religious conservatism. This chapter examines how the Indonesian women’s rights movement has fared with the advent of democratization. While democratization in Indonesia has produced important gains for women’s rights, it has also empowered conservative activists who oppose much of the agenda of the women’s rights movement. Women’s rights activists have had difficulty responding to this challenge because of ideological divisions and lack of a mass base, and because the state has been increasingly willing to defer to conservative forces. In short, the key factors for the fate of women’s rights activism during Indonesia’s democratization have been the patterns of women’s mobilization, the strength of counter-movement mobilization, and political decentralization—all of which have been shaped by pre-transition political legacies. The experience of activists in Indonesia suggests that the recent literature on democratization and women’s rights would benefit from greater consideration of how and when democratization processes can empower illiberal actors, counter-movements, and/or backlash against women’s rights.",TRUE,FALSE,Democratization|Feminism|Gender|Indonesia|Islam|Muslim|Women|Women's Rights,2019-05-23T21:10:21.448177,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23T21:10:03.830002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Rachel Rinaldo,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/citation/,cfyva,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce709b035f2580017a88ade/,5ce709b035f2580017a88ade,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfyva/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfyva
