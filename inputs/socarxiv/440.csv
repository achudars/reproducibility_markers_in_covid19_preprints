Joining Marxian and Simmelian ideas, it provides a multi-dimensional,  formal, and synthetic theory of alienation. The paper develops a set of theoretical tools for articulating formal elements of action that make alienation possible, without giving conceptual priority to alienation in the sphere of production, or within that sphere to the alienation of labor. These tools make it possible to derive classical notions of alienation as specific, contingent combinations of multiple elements, theorizing them as concrete socio-historical configurations of a broader universe of possibilities. They also organize systematic reflection on various forms and relations of alienation; not only those between for instance labor and capital, but also among all four factors of production: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.

Therefore, the computational complexity is significantly increased since cardinality constraints have a direct influence on the portfolio size. In order to overcome arising computational difficulties, for solving this problem, researchers have focused on investigating efficient solution algorithms such as metaheuristic algorithms since exact techniques may be inadequate to find an optimal solution in a reasonable time and are computationally ineffective when applied to large-scale problems. In this paper, our purpose is to present an efficient solution approach based on an artificial bee colony algorithm with feasibility enforcement and infeasibility toleration procedures for solving cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the solution methodology. In this study, the ABC-I algorithm and the ABC-II algorithm, which are the modern meta-innovative models for solving optimization problems, have been used to optimize the investment portfolio with the goal of increasing returns and reducing risk. Of the 591 companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange, 150 companies were selected during the period from 2014 to 2018 using a systematic elimination method with limitation as the final sample. The data from these companies were analyzed using the algorithms used in the research and their performance was compared.

World leaders had agreed that increased transparency was urgently needed to help shore up national fiscal systems and alleviate social injustices. These new rules have wide-ranging economic and political consequences for the regulation of global wealth chains (GWCs). Tax transparency is a key factor in the level of information asymmetry between wealth chain â€˜insidersâ€™, such as corporations and tax advisers, and â€˜outsidersâ€™, such as tax authorities and civil society activists. This chapter discusses the â€˜technicisationâ€™ of the OECD policy process to define these new requirements, i.e. the embedding of highly political discussions in a specialised, expertise-intensive policy context. Technicisation constrained the post-crisis political momentum for expanded transparency of corporate wealth chains, but also helped normalize the idea of increased transparency as â€˜risk assessmentâ€™ within the policy community. The chapter highlights three key dynamics of technicisation: policy insulation, re-framing and appropriateness judgments.

Field evidence for two paths to cross-cultural competence: implications for cultural dynamics. Evolutionary Human Sciences 2, e3, 1â€“16. https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2020.1             Interaction between members of culturally-distinct (ethnic) groups is an important driver of the evolutionary dynamics of human culture, yet the relevant mechanisms remain under-explored. For example, cultural loss resulting from integration with culturally-distinct immigrants or colonial majority populations remains a topic whose political salience exceeds our understanding of mechanisms that may drive or impede it. For such dynamics, one mediating factor is the ability to interact successfully across cultural boundaries (cross-cultural competence). However, measurement difficulties often hinder its investigation. Here, simple field methods in a uniquely-suited Amazonian population and Bayesian item-response theory models are used to derive the first experience-level measure of cross-cultural competence, as well as evidence for two developmental paths: Cross-cultural competence may emerge as a side effect of adopting out-group cultural norms, or it may be acquired while maintaining in-group norms. Ethnographic evidence suggests that the path taken is a likely consequence of power differences in inter- versus intra-group interaction. The former path, paralleling language extinction, can lead to cultural loss; the latter to cultural sustainability. Recognition of such path-dependent effects is vital both to theory of cultural dynamics in humans and perhaps other species, and to effective policy promoting cultural diversity and constructive inter-ethnic interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|Cross-cultural competence|Ethnicity|Indigenous peoples|Intercultural competence|Item Response Theory|multiculturalism|Norms,2018-12-07T12:59:01.976102,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-07T12:58:22.656524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d53|Education|Indigenous Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dae|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Multicultural Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/citation/,468ns,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gjuzv/,gjuzv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c098bdba9b99c001a166dfb/,5c098bdba9b99c001a166dfb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/468ns/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/468ns

This mixed-methods study examines the experiences of students participating in one of the first iterations of this trend: a blended professional master's degree program that admitted students based on performance in MOOC-based online courses. We found that the blended master's program attracted a cohort of highly educated mid-career professionals from developed countries who were looking for more flexible alternatives to traditional graduate programs. Success in the online courses was correlated with higher levels of prior formal education and effective use of learning strategies. Students who enrolled in the blended graduate program reported being academically prepared for their coursework and had higher GPAs (3.86, p&lt;0.01) than students in the residential program (3.75).

I offer a more comprehensive view by considering social exclusion in cultural settings varying in terms of legitimacy and by studying how people differ in their understanding of social exclusion (that is, criteria used to draw social boundaries demarcating certain cultural settings as inappropriate for some people). I scrutinize the centrality of modes of consumption in these understandings of social exclusion. Using survey data representative for the Flemish population (n=3,144), I inductively analyse attitudes towards classical and pop/rock concerts. I uncover four understandings of social exclusion that are present with regard to both types of concerts. These understandings differ (a) in whether they stem from an insidersâ€™ or outsidersâ€™ perspective and (b) in how they use modes of consumption as criteria for social exclusion. Additionally, I find that peopleâ€™s understanding of social exclusionâ€”i.e., which criteria people consider relevant for social exclusionâ€”drives what cultural contexts they perceive as socially exclusive.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-06T14:30:21.448576,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-06T14:27:49.214748,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/citation/,ux78b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g37tc/,g37tc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c08d95b9f61b5001927f771/,5c08d95b9f61b5001927f771,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ux78b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ux78b/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ux78b

We provide one of the first quantitative tests of this question in Tunisia, the Arab Spring's only success story. We argue that power-sharing may reduce polarization for a limited time, but at the cost of undermining democratic institutions. To measure polarization, we examine all rollcall votes from Tunisia's first and second post-transition parliaments. We employ a time-varying ideal point model and examine whether power-sharing agreements led to convergence in political parties' ideal points. Our analysis reveals that Tunisia's national unity government in 2015 temporarily moderated political tensions and allowed for parliamentary activity to resume. However, despite a broadening of the coalition in mid-2016, polarization reemerged and crucial legislation stalled. Moreover, longitudinal survey data suggest that the failure of power-sharing in Tunisia contributed to disillusionment with political parties, parliament, and democracy.",TRUE,FALSE,democracy|legislature|Middle East|policy|power-sharing|transitions|Tunisia,2018-12-06T04:27:01.446679,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-06T04:26:42.887435,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/citation/,6z74r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/59qa3/,59qa3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c083fe798fee70017a70e73/,5c083fe798fee70017a70e73,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6z74r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6z74r/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6z74r
