The Host Paradox and other counterintuitive properties of the FIFA ranking.,"FIFA's ranking of national soccer teams is plagued with paradoxes. One surprising paradox is a dramatic underrating of the hosts of main tournaments. The hosts, who are absent from the preliminaries, for a long time, play only friendlies that award few points. Three models estimate the magnitude of the resulting “Host Effect” at 14.1-16.7 positions. Such an estimate goes against the intuition that a large investment in hosting a tournament should result in the improvement of the host team’s standing. Host’s low ranking decreases the interest in the tournament and may result in a major loss of advertisement revenue.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-11-18T03:32:41.955718,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-18T03:32:19.974852,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies,Marek M.

A bibliometric approach is proposed for a case study of a scientific discipline, language and period that are poorly represented in current bibliographic databases.

Publication language and author nationalities were manually included in the data set. Journal internationality measures and coauthorship network analyses showed: 1) that internationalisation was not the most striking change over the study period: it was one of a number of features that journal editors addressed in their own way; 2) results confirm a change in the social organisation of scientific production in archaeology, with the emergence of co-authorship and reflect the differentiation of local research trends.

This case study enables us to explore the actual conceptual relationships between archaeology and the other sciences (as opposed to those wished for or prescribed). The contrasts between the positions declared by the two researchers and the rooting of their arguments in their disciplines are examined: where the sociologist makes use of his philosophical training, the archaeologist relies mainly on his work on semiology and informatics. Archaeology ultimately plays a minor role in the arguments proposed. This dispute therefore cannot be considered as evidence for the movement of concepts between archaeology and the social sciences.

Some Preliminary Evidence from a Most Likely Case,"While universities play a key role in questions of free speech and political viewpoint diversity, they are often associated with the opposite of a free exchange of ideas: a proliferation of restrictive campus speech codes, violent protests against controversial speakers, and even the firing of inconvenient professors. For some observers these trends on university campuses are a clear indicator of the dire future for freedom of speech. Others view these incidents as scandalized singular events and regard the campus intolerance as a mere myth. We take an empirical look at some of the claims in the debate and present original survey evidence from a most likely case: the leftist social science studentship at Goethe University Frankfurt. Our results show that taking offense is a common experience and that a sizable share of students is in favor of restricting speech on campus. We also find evidence for conformity pressures on campus and that both, the desire to restrict speech and the reluctance to speak openly, differ significantly across political ideology. Students on the left are less likely to tolerate controversial viewpoints and students on the right are more likely to self-censor on politically sensitive issues such as gender, immigration or sexual and ethnic minorities.

We provide the first global overview of parental bereavement, its magnitude, prevalence, and distribution over age, for the 1950-2000 annual birth cohorts of women using a novel methodology from formal demography applied to data from the 2019 Revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects. We project that the global burden of parental bereavement will be 1.6 times lower for women born in the year 2000 than for women born in 1955. Accounting for compositional effects, we anticipate the largest improvements in regions of the Global South where offspring mortality continues to be a common life event. The paper quantifies an unprecedented shift in the timing of parental bereavement from reproductive to retirement ages. Starting with the 1985 cohort, women will be more likely to lose an adult child after age 65 than a young child before age 50, reversing a long-standing global trend. ""Child death"" will increasingly come to mean the death of adult offspring. We project persisting regional inequalities in offspring mortality and in the availability of children in later life, a particular concern for parents dependent on support from their children after retirement. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest a progressive narrowing of the historical gap between the Global North and South in the near future.

The simultaneous and relatively rapid transitions that occur during gentrification make accounting for duration of exposure particularly important when exploring the relationship between gentrification and individual well-being. Though a large literature explores how the residential context, as well as the timing and duration of exposure to relatively stable neighborhood conditions, affects health, little is known about how duration of exposure to gentrification is linked to the health of longtime residents. Using restricted, longitudinal data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, I ask (1) how is duration of exposure to gentrification linked to individual health? (2) How is gentrification differentially linked to individual health outcomes across ethnoracial groups? Results demonstrate that a longer duration of residence in a gentrifying neighborhood is associated with improved self-reported health. This analysis suggests that efforts must be made to allow longtime residents to remain in their neighborhoods as they undergo change to ensure that these residents are able to reap the health benefits of the neighborhood improvements that accompany gentrification.",TRUE,FALSE,Gentrification|Health|Los Angeles|neighborhood effects,2019-11-15T08:09:01.351472,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T08:08:35.599005,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/citation/,5dmsk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dce28f05b97bd000c56d306/,5dce28f05b97bd000c56d306,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5dmsk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5dmsk,NA

We estimate deep (measured as less than 20% of medians) and extreme (measured as less than 10% of medians) poverty in the U.S. from 1993-2016. Using the Current Population Survey, we match the income definition of the Luxembourg Income Study and adjust for underreporting using Urban Institute’s TRIM3 model. In 2016, we estimate 5.2 to 7.2 million Americans (1.6-2.2%) were deeply poor and 2.6 to 3.7 million (.8-1.2%) were extremely poor. While deep and extreme poverty fluctuated over time, including declines from 1993-1995 and 2007-2010, we find significant increases from lows in 1995 to peaks in 2016 in both deep (increases of 48-93%) and extreme poverty (increases of 54-111%). We even find significant increases with thresholds anchored at 1993 medians. Adding homelessness, deep poverty would be 7-8% higher and extreme poverty would be 19-23% higher in 2016, which suggests our estimates are probably lower-bounds. The rise of deep/extreme poverty is concentrated among childless households. Among households with children, the expansion of SNAP benefits has led to declines in deep/extreme poverty. Ultimately, we demonstrate that estimates of deep/extreme poverty depend critically on the quality of income measurement.",TRUE,FALSE,deep poverty|extreme poverty|income|measurement|poor|poverty,2019-11-15T08:04:01.605921,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T08:03:43.962852,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/citation/,73myr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcd90c32e8f65000c3d18f2/,5dcd90c32e8f65000c3d18f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73myr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/73myr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/73myr,NA
