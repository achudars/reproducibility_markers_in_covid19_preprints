The research has involved individual in-depth semi-structured interviews with six English Foreign Language (EFL) teachers and six students to further explore key issues from their viewpoints. The main findings have unveiled that both teachers and students recognise the motivating potential of all the examined scales. Many similarities and some dissimilarities related to specific motivational themes have emerged. In terms of dissimilarity, students accorded importance to group work scale, however teachers minimised its role by justifying that it needed certain conditions. Another area of mismatch can be noticed in the way students and teachers regarded tasks in motivating students. Teachers stressed on providing clear instruction and explanation while students pointed to the content of tasks. Furthermore, another instance of difference in participants’ views towards the same scale in terms of the motivational strategies to be used was in teacher behaviour scale. Both participants agreed to place value on it, but students appeared to emphasise on the social aspects as feeling relaxed and enjoying the class in order to participate fully, while teachers stressed on academic achievement.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic achievement|EFL teachers|group work|motivational strategies|perceptions|students|tasks|teacher behavior,2019-07-21T21:14:27.436118,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:13:57.544985,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/citation/,5g4kq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9e2e73cd70c0016ff6036/,5cf9e2e73cd70c0016ff6036,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5g4kq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5g4kq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5g4kq

Observing the very limited rate of use of English in the Algerian community, English as Foreign Language (EFL) students, actually, need to progress in the mastery of that language by reading and/or listening to texts or messages intensively. To achieve this goal, subsequent procedures should take place by giving the foreign language a rather more appreciable position in the community such as the one held by a second language. To be down-to-earth, a brief survey on the linguistic situation in Algeria is exposed where neat clarification of second-foreign language status in the community is laid out to show that the more a (foreign) language is explicitly exposed in its manifold forms, the more are learners, in that community, likely to acquire it as a second language. However, the assumption of presenting the receptive skills (reading and listening) as the most appropriate means for the growth of foreign language vocabulary is supported by Krashen’s input theory where any input to be understood, should come at EFL learners’ capacity to read/listen and decode easily the meaning. In due course, First year EFL students have been subject to a language proficiency test-‘a pre-test then a post-test’. This typical experimental design is an intervention study which contains two groups: ‘the treatment or experimental’ group which receives the treatment, or which is exposed to some special conditions of intensifying vocabulary learning through a varied, comprehensible input; and a second group of EFL learners- the control group- whose role is to provide a baseline. The findings showed better scores among the experimental group compared to the other group.

These theoretical foundations enable the instructor to appropriately implement the outlined approach along its salient features to achieve the desired outcomes. Despite this tight rapport, teachers of English at the University of Mostaganem tend to rely on their common-sense teaching practices that are mainly informed by their experience of teaching EFL. The gap between the two extremes theory and practice, the premise of this paper, may be widened as teachers do not develop accurate and scientific understandings of certain pedagogical concepts, in this case, learner-centeredness as agreed on by professional academics, let alone to apply it along its proper standards. The pedagogical sequel of such misunderstanding mainly relate to random references to both teacher and learner-centered approaches in classroom teaching practices. The study via a detailed teachers’ questionnaire revealed that teachers of English, in addition to the cursory understandings they develop in relation to the very meaning of a learner-centered approach, tend to eschew developing learners’ metacognitive skills in their teaching practices. Most importantly, they are likely to rely on traditional ways of assessment instead of authentic frameworks, a cardinal feature within the current paradigm.",TRUE,FALSE,Authentic assessment|constructivism|learner-centered approach|metacognition|teacher-centered approach,2019-07-21T21:12:47.764254,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:12:17.169900,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/citation/,pefw4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9e14e89c983001abcc445/,5cf9e14e89c983001abcc445,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pefw4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pefw4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pefw4

Accordingly, teachers need to look out for additional training opportunities. One of these opportunities is found in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Nevertheless, research on applying MOOCs for continuous professional development (CPD) with regard to Algeria is overlooked. Hence, this study aims at filling in this gap by exploring Algerian university teachers’ familiarity, disposition, and experiences of using MOOCs for CPD. To reach this end, an online questionnaire is administered and a semi-structured interview is conducted with university teachers. The results of the study evinced that: 1) Teachers have low familiarity and weak interaction with MOOCs in general and, 2) teachers acknowledge the importance of CPD and are aware that the initial training and the teaching experience are not sufficient to maintain career advancement. Yet, 3) they do not have the disposition to engage in a CPD, 4) teachers consider this study as an eye opener on MOOCs and show a positive attitude for leveraging MOOCs for their CPD in the future. In the light of these findings, urgent plans to implement and value the culture of informal CPD are recommended, in addition to creating centres at the level of the universities devoted exclusively to CPD and related research.

In the aftermaths of ‘the bloody decade’, Algeria lost the pillars of its tertiary education. To compensate, the government relied on mass access to universities which has in its turn resulted in low quality. This work seeks to check the usability of the human capital approach in solving the quality problem in Algerian universities. Because education could offer both monetary and non-monetary profits, it is considered lucrative to invest in developing human skills and competences which constitute the capital that guarantees earning a living. This research, thus, proposes ‘academic advising’ as a first step on the short term. The current paper presents a descriptive analysis of 50 questionnaires answered by middle and high school teachers and headmasters, university students and professors and guidance counselors. The results of this qualitative study show how ‘academic advising’ when extended up to the university level can harness the learner’s capital.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic advising|Algerian higher education|quality|the human capital approach,2019-07-19T19:24:07.431762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:23:31.630446,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/citation/,ycrbf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9dfc389c9830018bcd6a0/,5cf9dfc389c9830018bcd6a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ycrbf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ycrbf

The latter assesses learners using different digital means one of which are social media. The present study investigated the impact of social media, as being one aspect of e-assessment tools, on EFL students’ written production. It tried to highlight the nature of this impact, enquired about the reasons behind their writing difficulties, and explored whether these errors were caused by social media or not. This research work relied on a case study that consisted of 31 third-year undergraduates and 22 English teachers at the department of English at Tlemcen University, Algeria. The data were gathered through the use of two questionnaires administered to both learners and instructors plus two writing tasks, one assigned on social media and the other in the classroom. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively through error analysis. After identifying the different errors produced by the students, the findings revealed that a relationship existed between learners’ use of social media and their writing issues. Their intensive use of social media led to a significant decrease in the writing level of the learners who have developed a new form of writing that includes linguistic habits which reflect the informalities often found on a social media environment, and do not necessarily follow the norms and rigours of the English language.

The main contributor to this process is always the teacher who has to adhere to the process of change for the purposes of developing his/her own career and improving the quality of teaching. This study aims to determine how action research would improve quality teaching in pre-service and in-service teacher training, and shed light on the reciprocal relationship between action research and innovation. In this paper, action research is considered as a constant independent variable that can enhance the dependent variables of pre-service / in-service teacher training and quality teaching requirements. The latter are supposed to be two purposes of innovation. Innovation is, thus, performed as the usual practice of innovative teachers who take risks of improving quality teaching in a methodological procedure according to their teaching contexts. The study attempts to answer the following questions: What is quality teaching and how does it impact innovation within the quality teaching assurance framework? What is action research and how does it help teachers improve their research and innovation potential? What does the ENS programme course provide as qualitative training to improve quality teaching and innovation? And, What are the results achieved, so far, at the ENS Constantine? We will illustrate the whole procedure with a specific example of teacher training at Ecole Normale Supérieure of Constantine.",TRUE,FALSE,Action research|innovation|quality teaching|teacher training,2019-07-19T19:21:22.097343,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19T19:20:58.926827,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/citation/,69ywj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9dd4f3cd70c0016ff5c85/,5cf9dd4f3cd70c0016ff5c85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ywj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69ywj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69ywj

We gather information on 1,548 previously reported semi-elasticities from 66 academic studies covering 20 developed countries. We supplement this dataset with country-level institutional structure and coverage data from the OECD. These include employment and wage rigidities, labor mobility, active labor market programs spending, and product market regulation. We relate estimated wage effects and institutional coverage while con- trolling for local economic conditions, immigrant skill composition, time and region fixed effects and study characteristics. Higher labor market rigidity, as brought about by more widespread institutions, regulations and policies, mitigates the effects on relative wages of high- versus low-skilled natives but exacerbates the impacts on average earnings. Overall, our results suggest that labor mar- ket institutions and policies may be effective tools in the economic absorption of foreign workers.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-07T21:32:43.511846,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-07T21:32:34.204102,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/citation/,3aj4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9a8ac46ad4d0017d38ca5/,5cf9a8ac46ad4d0017d38ca5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3aj4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3aj4n/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3aj4n

The results are mixed. Smaller central cities and more special district overlap are important for population growth. The find- ings do not generalize to employment or per capita money income growth. These findings mask important regional variation: political fragmentation is largely unrelated to economic growth in Midwestern and Western metropolitan areas. These results partially support the hypothesis that governmental fragmentation can enhance local economic growth; however, the overall impact appears muted relative to a metropolitan area’s economic characteristics",TRUE,FALSE,competition|decentralization|fragmentation|growth,2019-06-06T23:53:08.171324,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-06T23:52:44.848127,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/citation/,dx75m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jazux/,jazux,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf98ff08c451d0017ea3939/,5cf98ff08c451d0017ea3939,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dx75m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dx75m/,https://doi.org/10.1080/07352166.2020.1742578,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dx75m
