It has been under investigation by number of scholars and researchers over the years, the concept of learner autonomy has been supported by number of researchers, others attempted to prove that it does not fit all learners of different backgrounds. In this research paper, the focus is mainly on learners’ perspectives of learner autonomy, what do they know? To what extent the students understand the concept of learner autonomy?  Developing autonomous learners is an area that needs to be explained. There are limited studies conducted in the Saudi context therefore, this study investigates Preparatory year female EFL students’ perspectives of learner autonomy in the Saudi context. Moreover, it examines whether the learners have the knowledge and the competence to develop their learning. The perspectives and views of 150 learners were collected using a questionnaire. The study follows a mixed methods approach.  The reviewed literature showed that implications of learner autonomy reflected positively on learners (Burkert &amp; Schwienhorst. 2008; Han, 2015).

In this regard, the researchers inquire about how intercultural communication affects English as a foreign language (EFL) students during the process of learning English literary texts carrying aspects of the target culture. This study, thus, endeavours at shedding light on students’ attitudes towards some aspects of the English culture when studying literary texts. It also intends at scrutinizing teachers’ strategies in teaching culture through literature; referring to their active roles in fostering intercultural awareness and Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC) among their learners. To do so, the researchers collected data through a questionnaire addressed to forty first-year Master students of Literature and Civilization in the department of English at Tlemcen University supported by an interview with teachers of literature. The findings revealed that most students exhibit negative attitudes towards some aspects of the English culture when studying literature. Their responses demonstrate that they are unaware and ignore the differences between cultures i.e., they are not culturally competent enough to avoid intercultural clash within various lectures of literature. The results also showed that teachers peacefully attempt to provide the appropriate teaching techniques and strategies to integrate teaching culture through literary texts to foster tolerance and empathy with speakers’ target language, identity, and culture.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes.|Communicative Competence|English culture|Foreign language students|Literary Texts,2020-07-20T01:15:41.794826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T01:15:29.185450,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/citation/,vgh6e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f14ea550870f200dd097a6c/,5f14ea550870f200dd097a6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgh6e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vgh6e/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no2.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vgh6e

It is presumed that when Islam-related terms are used without regard to their original connotations, they are likely to lose their original meanings and begin to take on altered meanings created by the media. Therefore, this study aims to explore the use of Islam-related terminologies in selected eastern and western mass media outlets in relation to their semantic and linguistic interpretations. The study employed a qualitative approach in which content analysis was used. Using purposive sampling, The Jordan Times and Al-Jazeera were chosen from the eastern Arab world while The BBC and The Guardian were chosen from the western media. total of 368 news articles focusing on Islam and Muslims were collected from the selected news media outlets using internet-based search from March 2018 until October 2019. The findings showed significant differences (P = 0.000/P &lt; 0.05) exist between the selected eastern and western mass media outlets in using Islam-related terminologies. The terms are used more frequently in the western media outlets than in the eastern media outlets. Further analysis of the findings revealed that the selected media outlets use Islam-related terminologies, such as “Islamist” and “Jihadist”, in negative contexts. The use of Islam-related terminologies in the selected media outlets could be influential in making the audience to perceive Islam as a religion of terrorism. The negative use of Islam-related terms could be minimized through training of journalists on news coverage of religion, provision of proper guidelines on religious reporting and ensuring that these guidelines are strictly followed.

The present syntactic study brings detailed quantitative and qualitative syntactic analyses of peripheral sentence elements, sentence (stance) adverbials, occurring in the Victorian novel Jane Eyre (1847), and offers their classification into style and content disjuncts. As the latter ones are generally employed by fiction in the novels’ dialogues and main characters’ reflections (Biber, 1999), the research questions focus predominantly on their function and frequency of use. Content disjuncts help to express the possibility or the doubt of the utterance and explain the outcome of the actions and events happening in the story. The research outcomes have confirmed that content disjuncts considerably contribute to understanding the writing style of Charlotte Brontë. This phenomenon can be further studied and developed in the syntactic analyses of other remarkable 19th century novels and novelists.

This article reports on an investigation into the social practices associated with assessing the classroom performance of pre-service English language teachers at Sultan Qaboos Univeristy (SQU), Rustaq College of Education and Nizwa University. Specifically, this study aims at answering one research question:  How do stakeholders understand and experience feedback when assessing pre-service teacher classroom performance? The research adopted a phenomenological approach for examining a total of 10 participants’ feedback experiences through semi-structured interviews and observations of the phenomenon in situ. The findings of this study revealed shared understandings about the purpose of feedback for improving pre-service teachers’ classroom performance. However, it was revealed that variations in feedback processes affected its efficacy in enhancing pre-service teachers’ classroom readiness.

The death of women of childbearing age is primarily caused by problems related to reproductive health. This is a persistent problem in impoverished nations, such as India. In this study, we evaluate the reproductive performance among the villagers in Birsingha Gram, Midnapore district, located in rural West Bengal, India.

More specifically, the paper tries to explore the hidden relations of power and ideologies that have been encoded in Mandela’s defense speech. The main research question is: what are the ideological meanings Mandela tries to communicate through his speech, and how are these ideologies conveyed by CDA strategies?  The paper draws on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), as discussed in the writings of Fairclough (1989, 2013) and Van Dijk (1993, 2001, 2014). The analysis covers two levels of analysis: the lexical level and the pragmatic level of analysis. Both levels are discussed under the theoretical umbrella of CDA. The paper reveals that Mandela managed, by using specific CDA strategies, to communicate particular ideological meanings that reflect his political stance, as well as his rebellious spirit as the most distinguished revolutionary leader who struggles against racial discrimination in South Africa.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-19T03:18:40.803740,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-19T03:18:18.032822,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://awej.org/index.php/volume-11-2020/99-awej-volume-11-number-2-june-2020/1728-a-critical-discourse-analysis-of-nelson-mandela-s-defense-speech-i-am-prepared-to-die,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d15|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature|Other English Language and Literature|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/citation/,mj89s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f13b5dc6ef440009abd459d/,5f13b5dc6ef440009abd459d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj89s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mj89s/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no2.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mj89s
