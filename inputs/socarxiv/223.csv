An important part of topology is counting the numbers of pieces and holes in objects, and people use this information to group objects into different types. For example, a doughnut has the same number of holes and the same number of pieces as a teacup with one handle, but it is different from a ball. In studies that resemble activities like “connect the dots”, scientists use ideas from topology to study the shape of data. Data can take many possible forms: a picture made of dots, a large collection of numbers from a scientific experiment, or something else. The approach in these studies is called 'topological data analysis', and it has been used to study the branching structures of veins in leaves, how people vote in elections, flight patterns in models of bird flocking, and more.

A small-sample case study of the Croatian news website Index.hr,"A history of research on radio frequency radiation, and recent scant research on the newly emerging 5G suggests that the expansion of 5G poses a possible public health issue. The media play a decisive role in how the public responds to a public health issue, and what it knows about it. However, there is an increasing amount of misinformation on health topics in the media. The present case study investigated whether the Croatian news website Index.hr manipulates information on the health effects of 5G. We constructed one experimental corpus, containing all articles by Index.hr on health effects of 5G, and two control corpora, one with articles about health effects of 5G published by reliable mainstream media, and one with articles about science (but not 5G) published by Index.hr. We assessed the presence of references, scientific references, misinformation, opinion expression, and opinion subjectivity. Compared to Index.hr science articles, Index.hr 5G articles were 10.78 times likelier to contain no references, 4.20 times likelier to contain no scientific references, 10.78 times likelier to contain misinformation, 288.14 times likelier to express the author’s opinion on the issue, and 16.95 times likelier to express a subjective opinion. The simultaneous increase in misinformation and reduction in referencing suggests that misinformation doesn’t stem from other unreliable sources of information, but that the misinformation is produced within Index.hr. An increase in opinion expression, and opinion subjectivity in the context of misinformation suggests that Index.hr is manipulating the information on health effects of 5G. This is corroborated by the fact that the two types of misinformation identified in the present study included erroneous referencing, and denial of the existence of scientific literature on the topic. Furthermore, all articles on both 5G, and scientific topics were written by different authors, indicating that this phenomenon is systematic within Index.hr. We conclude that our data point to a manipulation of information on health effects of 5G by Index.hr.

In particular, these changes parallel Viviana Zelizer’s work on the changing valuation of children a century ago.

Although there have been efforts to rectify this through the creation of scholarships, there have been no systematic studies of the full cost of archaeological field schools. Here, we present a study of 208 field schools from 2019, including their tuition, room and board, and airfare, as well as the wages that students may lose by participating in them rather than working. We also explore how archaeologists interviewed for Heath-Stout’s dissertation study of diversity issues in the discipline have navigated finding field experiences. We argue that scholarships are an ineffective and insufficient means of promoting equity and accessibility in the field because the root of the problem lies in institutionalized inequality and exclusivity. We provide strategies that students and faculty can use to address these problems on both individual and systemic levels.

Biometric data is gained in everyday life by mobile phones or health wristbands. The ethical dimension of the use of neuro interfaces is hardly questioned, neither in research nor in its artistic applications, which is surprising but a necessity for the self-determined user who is more than an object of produsage. In the centre of this inquiry stand very actual critical art works with life science devices and its corresponding participative games, in an emerging critical art form of neuro-games, in a new form of expanded game art. Brain interfaces for the consumer market target life improvement but in fact they capitalise our inner states in a mode of prosumption. 
Expanded game art settings in public installations can fruitfully contribute to the sciences with the advantage of a controllable set of rules, which is useful for the research validity. These art pieces correspond to citizen science games, where scientists use games to analyse data in a collective mode. On the other hand, biometric aspects and neuro-interfaces used in performative installations allow to design a new kind of game art, made of elements of behavioural research and a critical questioning of the interfaces used in play.

However, the spread of the virus has been uneven in both prevalence and speed of its propagation. Given the role of social factors in the spread of contagious diseases and the known demographic, economic and cultural differences in Europe, we analyse the contribution of such factors in the coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: Diagnosed COVID-19 cases from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and the European Social Survey for 20 European countries were used to estimate bivariate associations between cumulative reported case numbers ten-day intervals during March 2020 and ten social, demographic and economic variables. To avoid overfitting, we first reduce these variables to three factors (labelled “socially and economically vibrant”, “high-educated and not aged”, and “densely populated and traditional”) by means of factor analysis before conducting a multiple regression analysis. We also perform a sensitivity analyses using rates and new cases between two time periods.
Findings: The socially and economically vibrant factor has a strong and positive association with COVID-19 throughout the study period. The association with the densely populated and traditional factor was initially low but by mid-March similar to the socially and economically vibrant factor.
Conclusions: For future influenza-like pandemics where a vaccine is not yet available, early movement restrictions will be especially crucial to curb the spread of such diseases in economically, socially, and culturally vibrant and densely populated countries.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID19|Europe|Social tie,2020-04-14T05:03:50.469704,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T02:35:27.422898,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/citation/,sb8xn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ea248/,ea248,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e947916430166037ba07fa9/,5e947916430166037ba07fa9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sb8xn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sb8xn,NA
