There is public debate about published articles comparing the costs, benefits, and various pros and cons of printed versus electronic full-text journals. The advancement of online journals during recent years has given librarians a powerful new resource to support learning and research. 
This article explores issues relating to the print publication process and the electronic publication process in order to clarify the unique advantages and disadvantages of each media. Most commercial sites are subscription-based, or allow pay-per-view access. Many universities subscribe to electronic journals to provide access to their students and faculty, and it is generally also possible for individuals to subscribe. An increasing number of journals are now available with open access, requiring no subscription. This is the case with the Journal for ReAttach Therapy and Developmental Diversities. Most working paper archives and articles on personal homepages are free; as are collections in institutional repositories and subject repositories . One of the great advantages of electronic journals is the possibility of acquiring article-level metrics.
Printed journals are portable and convenient, don't require a device to read, have a high graphical resolution (easier to read) and are self-archiving. Printed journals should continue to survive, but only with a decrease in production and changes in content to suit more restricted niches left in the wake of the electronic journals.",TRUE,FALSE,academic journal|e-journal|electronic journal|information technology (IT)|open access (OA)|printed journal,2018-09-01T16:52:01.385720,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-01T16:51:34.225458,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/citation/,qybhw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cqyxf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/relationships/node/,cqyxf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8abb5ecc53a9001633e2d4/,5b8abb5ecc53a9001633e2d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qybhw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qybhw/,https://doi.org/10.26407/2018jrtdd.1.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qybhw

This article maintains that sociologists do not see the cultural mechanisms associated with downward mobility because we share three collective blinders. First, we under-emphasize the ways that middle-class cultural practices are mismatched with the practices that institutions reward. Second, we over-emphasize the utility of middle-class cultural practices for their class reproduction. We do this as we focus on youths’ cultural practices within institutions, ignoring that not all youth enter institutions associated with class reproduction. Third, we assume that the dominant cultural practices of each class keeps youth in their original social class. In doing so, we do not consider that middle-class actors avoid downward mobility by adopting the dominant practices of the working-class. Using interview data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, this article shows how removing these blinders can help us understand how culture relates to downward mobility.

The aim is to construct a phonemic and vocalic inventory of the language, as well as look into the syllable structure. The main objective of this research is to provide a phonological basis for further research in this language. Field methodology was used during data collection for this project. A word list of approximately 413 words was constructed and translated to Totok Chingkho by a native speaker. The translated words were transcribed using the IPA system, and were analyzed manually. The phonemic and vocalic inventory were created from minimal pairs extracted from the word-list. To determine the syllable structure, words were divided according to the number of syllables and their onset-nucleus, nucleus-coda relationship was investigated. There is a possibility for further research in phonological system as well as suprasegmental phonology of Totok Chingkho. Certain anomalies were observed, such as, the presence of labial stops and nasal sounds but absence of a labial fricative sound. Similarly, diphthongs were observed but not all could be confirmed.

However, there is insufficient empirical evidence to sustain the expectation that universal school voucher policies will substantially raise the performance of an education system by increasing school choice and competition; and, universal vouchers are likely to reinforce socioeconomic stratification.

Based on observational data and in-depth interviews with 16 surgeons, 11 nurses, and 36 patients and their family members between February 2016 and July 2017, it reveals how both victims and perpetrators normalize instances of micro-inequities, often failing to recognize or acknowledge them. The findings illustrate how the prevalence of micro-inequities varies between different medical institutions, and suggest that while subtle in nature, their effect raises concerns regarding dignity and respect for patients and family members. Drawing on existing philosophical analyses of micro-inequities, the study concludes that their production in hospital settings creates an institutional ethos that disdains and marginalizes patients and their family members.

In 1980s cyberpunk, Vernor Vinge, William Gibson, and Bruce Sterling imagined virtual worlds that informed generations of technology entrepreneurs. When Margaret Atwood was asked what draws her to dystopian visions of the future, she responded, ""I read the newspaper.""

This service currently displays the most cited English-language original research articles by fields and published in 2006. The main goal of this work is to describe the main characteristics and features of this Google Scholar’s new service, as well as to highlight its main strengths and weaknesses. To do this, a total of 2,515 records were extracted. Additionally, for each record, the following bibliographic data were gathered: broad subject category and subcategory, Title of the document, URL, Authors, Google Scholar Citation profiles’ URL, and Citations received. It is finally concluded that, although the product is easy to use and provides original data about highly cited documents at the level of disciplines, it still suffers of some methodological concerns, mainly related to the subject classification of documents and the use of homogenous visualization threshold regardless the discipline, that jeopardizes the utility of this product for bibliometric purposes. In addition to this, the lack of transparency constitutes a methodological concern, since Google Scholar does not to declare in detail how the product has been developed.",TRUE,FALSE,bibliometrics|citation analysis|citation classics|citation counts|classic papers|Google Scholar|highly-cited papers|most cited papers|scientometrics,2018-08-30T20:23:21.525228,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-30T20:23:13.432991,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/citation/,zkh7p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/43h65/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/relationships/node/,43h65,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b88225b30b0cd00170163fa/,5b88225b30b0cd00170163fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkh7p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zkh7p/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zkh7p

In this paper, I argue that the discourse of “the creep,” a stigmatized sexual figure, functions as a disciplinary mechanism that both creates and limits men’s desire and sense of self in the tense initiation of a sexual moment. My analysis of 244 articles from 3 popular men’s magazines suggests that an idealized sexual moment, as it is imagined in the pages of popular men’s magazines, is fraught with the risk of miscommunication and the potential for failure. The figure of the creep on the cusp of a sexual moment signals a tension in the masculine self that, if resolved successfully, produce a particular heterosexual masculinity and access to women’s bodies in an idealized sexual interaction. Furthermore, the discourse of the creep helps men manage these risks as they relate to feminist discourses about sexual harassment and violence. Ultimately, analyzing popular discourses of the creep reveals a set of cultural ten-sions threaded through heterosexual men’s romantic interactions.",TRUE,FALSE,dating|gender|media|sexuality|sexual violence,2018-08-29T20:43:25.592867,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-29T20:42:41.062081,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Clare Forstie|PhD,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/citation/,6ay5j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d3vek/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/relationships/node/,d3vek,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b87021b8dc469001d9451c7/,5b87021b8dc469001d9451c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ay5j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ay5j/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ay5j

This study used primary data obtained through a survey to 221 employees as a sample. The result of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis shows that empirically the leadership style, employee commitment, work motivation, and work climate have positive and significant impact on job satisfaction. Leadership style, employee commitment, work motivation, and work climate, either directly or indirectly have a positive and significant effect on employee performance through job satisfaction as variable intervening. Job satisfaction has a direct positive and significant effect on employee performance. The direct effect of leadership styles, employee commitment, motivation and work climate on employee performance is positive, which means that when the exogenous variables improved the job satisfaction and employee performance will increase. The indirect effect of exogenous variable on employee performance through job satisfaction is positive. The total effect which is the sum of the direct and indirect effects through job satisfaction obtained positive value, which means there is effect of direct effect and indirect effect of exogenous variable on employee performance through job satisfaction.",TRUE,FALSE,employee performance|HRM Practice|job satisfaction,2018-08-29T20:42:43.613942,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-29T20:42:25.108320,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/citation/,bct8p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/daenv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/relationships/node/,daenv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b86ef81b57ff50017ec9059/,5b86ef81b57ff50017ec9059,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bct8p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bct8p/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bct8p
