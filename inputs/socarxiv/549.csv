Yet there is little empirical research into the use of notice and takedown or its effectiveness. Because it depends on the private communications and actions of copyright holders, online service providers, and targets, notice and takedown operates largely within a difficult-to-study “black box.” This article contributes to the literature with an empirical look at two sets of takedown notices. It digests findings from two quantitative studies of takedown notices in the Lumen database, reported fully in the three-study report, Notice and Takedown in Everyday Practice (available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2755628), and peer-reviewed here. 

The first study, of notices sent to Google Web Search, shows a heavy reliance by large rightsholders on automated infringement detection and notification, and tends to support their assertions that they focus their enforcement resources on large-scale infringement. At the same time, 31% of these notices raised questions related to their accuracy and statutory compliance. The second study provides a snapshot of takedown as used by one set of smaller notice senders — individuals and small businesses sending to Google Image Search. In this study, notices were more likely to target social media sites, blogs, and personal websites, and 70% of the notices raised questions. While both studies revealed surprisingly high percentages of notices of questionable validity, the questions raised tended to differ. The automated notices in the first study predominantly exhibited issues identifying the works in question, while the notices sent by smaller rightsholders in the second study predominantly exhibited issues with the underlying claim. Accordingly, while notice sending appears to need improvement, there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach. Both “worlds” of notice sending need to be accommodated. We therefore suggest a set of voluntary best practices, educational efforts, and modest legal reforms directed to the different issues we observed.",TRUE,FALSE,copyright|copyright enforcement|empirical|infringement|intermediary liability|notice and takedown|section 512|takedown,2018-07-02T11:39:47.419626,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T09:34:46.421605,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/citation/,mduyn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n36ct/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/relationships/node/,n36ct,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8b2d5d60511e000ddc4902/,5a8b2d5d60511e000ddc4902,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mduyn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mduyn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mduyn

In the ensuing two decades, the notice and takedown process has become a primary tool for raising and resolving copyright disputes in the United States.

But despite its influence, there is little empirical research describing § 512's operation or its effectiveness. This article digests findings from a qualitative study, reported fully in the three-study report, Notice and Takedown in Everyday Practice (available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2755628) and peer-reviewed here, that helps fill this gap. Through detailed surveys and interviews with nearly three dozen respondents, we provide the first detailed account of how § 512 is implemented and experienced by online service providers and large rightsholders. All respondents agreed that the § 512 safe harbors and the ability to take down infringing material remain fundamental. But the online copyright enforcement ecosystem is also highly diverse, and all participants face challenges. The findings suggest that the notice and takedown system is important, under strain, and that there is no ""one size fits all"" approach to improving it. Based on the findings, we suggest a variety of best practices and limited legal reforms.",TRUE,FALSE,copyright|copyright enforcement|empirical|infringement|intermediary liability|notice and takedown|section 512,2018-07-02T11:39:47.383887,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T09:33:21.594509,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/citation/,hp9fz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zb3wv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/relationships/node/,zb3wv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8b2b02571031000f448eaf/,5a8b2b02571031000f448eaf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hp9fz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hp9fz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hp9fz

The survey aimed to assess the vitality of approximately 30 languages spoken by Tibetans in China. ‘Vitality’ can be roughly defined as an indicator of a language’s chances of being sustained in the future – if vitality is low, the language is less likely to be spoken in the future, if the vitality is high, it probably will. 

Data were collected on 20 languages (see Appendix 1 for further information). This data consisted of expert testimony from linguists and anthropologists who are intimately familiar with the demographic, social, political, cultural contexts in which the languages are spoken (see Appendix 2 for details). Questions consisted of multiple choice and Likert scale questions; opportunity for open comment was also provided. 

Where applicable, the caption above each graph shows the question that respondents were asked to answer.  Unless otherwise stated, values shown indicate the number of languages.

This paper will explore the way the affordances of machine learning itself, and the forms of social apparatus that it becomes a part of, will potentially erode ethics and draw us in to a drone-like perspective. Unconstrained machine learning enables and delimits our knowledge of the world in particular ways: the abstractions and operations of machine learning produce a ‘view from above’ whose consequences for both ethics and legality parallel the dilemmas of drone warfare. The family of machine learning methods is not somehow inherently bad or dangerous, nor does implementing them signal any intent to cause harm. Nevertheless, the machine learning assemblage produces a targeting gaze whose algorithms obfuscate the legality of its judgements, and whose iterations threaten to create both specific injustices and broader states of exception.

Although college-educated women postpone first births, they tend to ‘catch up’ by spacing higher-order births closer to first births compared to the less-educated.",TRUE,FALSE,Cohort Fertility Levels|Education|Fertility Timing|Generation X,2018-07-02T11:39:45.488001,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-16T22:43:04.790354,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/citation/,e4c9y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/udp54/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/relationships/node/,udp54,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8759ba95bb7b001238f415/,5a8759ba95bb7b001238f415,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4c9y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4c9y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4c9y

Despite this, there remains little structural support for LGBTQ+ survivors. This paper highlights the voices of 38 QTPOC-identified (queer and trans people of color) Southerners who have experienced sexual violence and came together across three focus groups to detail recount their interactions with advocates and other professionals and explore post-traumatic needs. Nearly all survivors reported that the level of awareness regarding sexual violence in their communities was limited, with most reporting that they did not successfully access mainstream services, due to concerns about homophobia, transphobia, and racism. To address sexual violence in LGBTQ+ communities, survivors pointed to the importance of friendship and community networks “outside the system,” resource sharing about non-heteronormative violence tactics, and holding batterers accountable for their behavior within LGBTQ+ circles. Findings highlight the need to move beyond “culturally competent” health care by proactively engaging LGBTQ+ communities in education, networking, resource sharing, and anti-violence outreach.",TRUE,FALSE,Domestic Violence|Health Care|Intimate Partner Violence|LGBT|LGBTQ|QTPOC|Resources|Service Provision|Southern|Trauma,2018-07-02T11:39:45.145776,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-16T16:33:22.240513,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/citation/,r4bvp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8zbvc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/relationships/node/,8zbvc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a86fcc97166bd000fb97372/,5a86fcc97166bd000fb97372,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4bvp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r4bvp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r4bvp

Findings indicate that heterosexual/straight women abused by women and bisexual women abused by women are significantly more likely to report current difficulty sleeping, while heterosexual/straight women abused by women and bisexual women abused by men are more likely to self-rate their overall mental health as poor (versus good or excellent). This is the first study using population-based data that takes into account all forms of violence and its impact on sexually diverse women—when we include psychological abuse and controlling tactics, the impact on mental health is worse than previously noted: around 80-90% of all women experience some form of anxiety, depression, intense fear, restlessness, nightmares, or stressors that impact their ability to work, go to school, and complete daily life activities.",TRUE,FALSE,Bisexual|Bisexuality|Domestic violence|Health|Intimate partner violence|LGBT|LGBTQ|Mental Health|Trauma,2018-07-02T11:39:45.110192,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-16T16:32:15.202763,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/citation/,7xn53,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b39vg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/relationships/node/,b39vg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a86fbe095bb7b001238a321/,5a86fbe095bb7b001238a321,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7xn53/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7xn53/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7xn53
