We investigate the role of objective and subjective indicators of economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 crisis in young Italians’ fertility plans during the year 2020. We use unique repeated cross-sectional data, collected at different time points during the pandemic (March and October/November 2020) together with pre-COVID data (2016). The data offer a standard fertility intention question pre- and during-COVID, and also a direct question on whether pre-COVID fertility plans have been confirmed, postponed or abandoned. We find that individuals with more vulnerable occupations show a lower probability of definitely intending to have a(nother) child in the short-term and a higher probability of having abandoned their pre-COVID fertility plan in March 2020, while in October 2020 changes in fertility plans did not vary by occupation. Instead, those who suffered from a negative income shock and those with negative expectations on their future income and occupation are more likely to abandon their pre-pandemic fertility plan compared to their better off counterparts, and these differences hold both in March and October. Overall, economic uncertainty generated by the pandemic seems to have similarly affected men and women’s fertility intentions. Our findings point to the fact that the unequal economic consequences of the pandemic also produced and will produce heterogeneous effects on fertility intentions.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|covid-19|economic uncertainty|fertility plans|Italy|sars-cov-2,2021-04-14T20:45:44.089157,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-14T13:30:26.169722,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/citation/,4sjvm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6076e18551f7ae0610f54483/,6076e18551f7ae0610f54483,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sjvm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4sjvm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4sjvm

To this aim, European cities adopted various urban mobility policies, which has led to a heterogeneous number of injuries across Europe. Monitoring the discrepancies in injuries and understanding the most efficient policies are keys to achieve the objectives of Vision Zero, a multi-national road traffic safety project that aims at zero fatalities or serious injuries linked to road traffic. Here, we identify urban features that are determinants of vulnerable road user safety through the analysis of inter-mode collision data across European cities. We first build up a data set of urban road crashes and their participants from 24 cities in 5 European countries, using the widely recommended KSI indicator (killed or seriously injured individuals) as a safety performance metric. Modelling the casualty matrices including road infrastructure characteristics and modal share distribution of the different cities, we observe that cities with the highest rates of walking and cycling modal shares are the safest for the most vulnerable users. Instead, a higher presence of low-speed limited roads seems to only significantly reduce the number of injuries of car occupants.

However, current methods to identify unconditional QTEs of continuous treatment variables are incomplete. Contrary to popular belief, the unconditional quantile regression model introduced by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009) does not identify QTE, while the propensity score framework of Firpo (2007) allows for only a binary treatment variable, and the generalized quantile regression model of Powell (2020) is unfeasible with high-dimensional fixed effects. This paper introduces a two-step approach to estimate unconditional QTEs where the treatment variable is first regressed on the control variables followed by a quantile regression of the outcome on the residualized treatment variable. Unlike much of the literature on quantile regression, this two-step residualized quantile regression framework is easy to understand, computationally fast, and can include high-dimensional fixed effects.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects|Quantile regressions|quantile treatment effects|residualized quantile regression|residual regression,2021-04-14T20:40:42.750269,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-14T13:28:40.146556,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/s9fjp/?view_only=2f12ca6cf4974c27a1e1055376474d95,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/citation/,42gcb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60768976f2ad330625a74a2d/,60768976f2ad330625a74a2d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gcb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42gcb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42gcb

In a field experiment in Pakistan, we vary how political office is portrayed to ordinary citizens. We find that emphasizing pro-social motives for holding political office instead of personal returns -- such as the ability to help others versus enhancing one's own respect and status -- raises the likelihood that individuals run for office and that voters elect them. It also better aligns subsequent policies with citizens' preferences. The candidacy decisions are explained by social influence, and not information salience -- we find that social versus personal messaging matters only when randomly delivered in a public setting but not in private.

The model builds a micro-foundation for the widely used linear-in-levels estimating equation. Returns to education for parents and productivity of financial investment in children’s education determine relative mobility, as measured by the slope, while the intercept depends, among other factors, on the degree of persistence in nonfarm occupations. Unlike many existing studies based on coresident samples, our estimates of intergenerational mobility do not suffer from truncation bias. The sons in rural India faced lower educational mobility compared with the sons in rural China in the 1970s to 1990s. To understand the role of genetic inheritance, Altonji et al. (2005) biprobit sensitivity analysis is combined with the evidence on intergenerational correlation in cognitive ability in economics and behavioral genetics literature. The observed persistence can be due solely to genetic correlations in China, but not in India. Father’s nonfarm occupation was complementary to his education in determining a sons’ schooling in India, but separable in China. There is evidence of emerging complementarity for the younger cohorts in rural China. Structural change in favor of the nonfarm sector contributed to educational inequality in rural India. Evidence from supplementary data on economic mechanisms suggests that the model provides plausible explanations for the contrasting roles of occupational dualism in intergenerational educational mobility in rural India and rural China.

We show that there are inherent tensions between some of the axioms underpinning prioritarianism and the principles underlying equality of opportunity; but also that these inconsistencies vanish under plausible adjustments to the domains of two key axioms, namely anonymity and the transfer principle. That is: reconciling prioritarianism and equality of opportunity is possible but allowing room for individual responsibility within prioritarianism requires compromises regarding the nature and scope of both impartiality and inequality aversion. The precise nature of the compromises depends on the specific variant of the theory of equality of opportunity that is adopted, and we define classes of social welfare functions and discuss relevant dominance conditions for six such variants. The conflicts and the paths to reconciliation are illustrated in an application to South Africa between 2008 and 2017, where results suggest broad empirical agreement among the different approaches.

Understanding policing-related emotions is vital not only because they are at the heart of the United States’ police legitimacy crisis, but also because they may have far-reaching effects on citizens’ lives. We measured personal and altruistic fear of the police in a nationwide sample of Americans (N = 1,150), which included comparable numbers of Blacks (N = 517) and Whites (N = 492). Most Whites felt safe, but most Blacks feared the police even more than crime, being afraid both for themselves and for others they cared about. The racial divide in fear was mediated by past experiences with police mistreatment. In turn, fear mediated the effects of race and past mistreatment on support for defunding the police and intentions to have “the talk” with family youths about the need to distrust and avoid officers. A Rawlsian cost-benefit analysis revealed that about half of Blacks would rather be the victim of a serious crime than be questioned or searched by the police. Taken together, the findings indicate that when it comes to the police, Blacks and Whites live in different emotional worlds, one of fear and the other of felt safety.

In view of conflicting theories and mixed prior evidence, we subject this question to a stringent test using large-scale, representative panel data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2009, N ≈ 26,000) and the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2019, N ≈ 77,000). We employ cross-lagged panel models with individual fixed effects to account for time-invariant confounders and reverse causality as two issues that have haunted earlier research. We find that religious involvement, measured by frequency of religious service attendance, on average has a positive impact on generalized trust, volunteering, and cooperation. Compared with religious attendance, other indicators of religious involvement, such as subjective importance of religion or whether one is religiously affiliated, have weaker effects on trust, volunteering, and cooperation. We also document substantial variation across religious traditions: the effects of religious attendance are strongest for Anglicans and other Protestants, but weaker and mostly statistically insignificant for Catholics, Hindus, and the nonreligious, while for Muslims we observe a negative effect of religious attendance on cooperation. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of potential confounders and a range of alternative model set-ups. Our study thus shows that religious involvement can indeed foster prosocial behaviours and attitudes, although this effect is in the current study context mostly restricted to religious service attendance and majority religions.",TRUE,FALSE,Cross-lagged panel models with fixed effects|Prosocial behaviour|Quantitative methods|Religion|Trust,2021-04-13T20:00:05.663783,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-13T18:33:29.998435,FALSE,NA,no,The analyses are based on the British Household Panel Survey and the UK Household Longitudinal Study which are publicly available from the UK data archive (https://www.data-archive.ac.uk/),,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/citation/,yv9et,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607585f5f6585f05806137cd/,607585f5f6585f05806137cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv9et/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yv9et/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yv9et

Social interactions in these platforms are mediated by digital institutions, which dictate algorithms that in turn affect how users form and evolve their opinions. In this work, we examine the conditions under which convergence on shared opinions can be obtained in a social network where connected agents repeatedly update their normalised cardinal preferences (i.e. value systems) under the influence of a non-constant reflexive signal (i.e. institution) that aggregates populations' information using a proportional representation rule. We analyse the impact of institutions that aggregate (i) expressed opinions (i.e. opinion-aggregation institutions), and (ii) cardinal preferences  (i.e. value-aggregation institutions). We find that, in certain regions of the parameter space, moderate institutional influence can lead to moderate consensus and strong institutional influence can lead to polarisation. In our randomised network, local coordination alone in the total absence of institutions does not lead to convergence on shared opinions, but very low levels of institutional influence are sufficient to generate a feedback loop that favours global conventions. We also show that opinion-aggregation may act as a catalyst for value change and convergence. When applied to digital institutions, we show that the best mechanism to avoid extremism is to increase the initial diversity of the value systems in the population.",TRUE,FALSE,opinion dynamics; social media; cultural evolution; institutions; influence; network science; complex systems,2021-04-14T20:37:22.435858,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-14T13:22:34.358553,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/jsegoviamartin/PR_institutions_values_opinions_model,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/citation/,546uy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6075788b51f7ae0569f52a8f/,6075788b51f7ae0569f52a8f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/546uy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/546uy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/546uy
