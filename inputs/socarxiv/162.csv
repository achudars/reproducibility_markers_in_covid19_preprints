Theory from feminist science studies, autoethnographic accounts, interviews, and experiments indicate that the substance of scientific research can have profound effects on how scientists are treated by colleagues and their sense of belonging in science. I bring together this disparate literature under the framework of professional cultures and show population-level trends supporting it. Drawing on the Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Web of Science, I use computational social science tools to argue that the way scientists write about sex in their research influences the future gender ratio of PhDs awarded across 53 subfields of the life sciences over a span of 47 years. Specifically, I show that a critical paradigm of “feminist biology” that seeks to de-essentialize sex and gender corresponds to increases in women’s graduation rates, while “sex difference” research—sometimes called “neurosexism” because of its emphasis on essential, categorical differences—has negative effects on women’s graduation rates in most fields.",TRUE,FALSE,bibliometrics|computational social science|feminism|feminist biology|feminist science|gender|gender and occupations|science and technology studies|sex|sex differences|sts|women in science|women in stem,2020-10-26T03:00:01.817479,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-26T02:59:53.624926,FALSE,NA,no,"NSF SED data are public.

Various methods have been used to assess the effectiveness of CCT programs but little attention has been devoted to finding out whether the grantees had benefited on an individual level. This study aimed to determine the enrollment status and academic performance of the pioneer beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), a human development program of the Philippine national government using the CCT scheme in a barangay situated in a poor municipality and province. Using data from the parent leader and from the scholastic records, it was found out that the program had a positive impact on the education of the pioneer children beneficiaries of the locality studied and it was highly successful in attaining its aim of making poor children stay in school. The study argues for the tracking of individual grantees as a measure of the CCT program’s success. Due to the study’s inherent limitations and exploratory nature, the following are recommended: replicate the study on a larger scale; continue tracking the pioneer as well as the other beneficiaries of the program to see whether its long-term desired outcomes are met; and study its possible negative aspects and effects.

To maintain the indivisibility of the 2030 Agenda, a growing number of approaches have been developed to provide knowledge of SDG interactions in the form of trade-offs and synergies. In this paper, we take stock of the rapid development, which has characterised the field, and conduct a critical review of the approaches available to support decision makers with the implementation of the UN Agenda. Our overall ambition is to provide a broad understanding of the support provided by existing methodologies to decision makers in light of the challenges emerging from the interconnected nature of the SDGs.
To achieve the aim of the study, we elect three specific objectives: (a) identify and categorise the most prominent approaches available for understanding SDG interactions based on a review of the literature and experience of SDG interaction analysis for decision making; (b) evaluate the requirements of decision makers based on an online survey of representatives of private and public organisations committed to SDG implementation at national and subnational level in Sweden; (c) assess how the approaches comply with the requirements of decision makers based on the views and opinions of developers of prominent tools. Sweden was selected due to the widely shared ambition of becoming a front runner of SDG implementation, and also considering the research team’s familiarity with the local context. The focus on local and national organisations is justified by the recognition that, while the 2030 Agenda is global in nature, its implementation is expected to take place primarily at local, regional and national level.
The results of the study highlight the existence of both methodological and conceptual challenges that are relevant to the empirical analysis of SDG interactions. To effectively contribute to decision making, approaches and tools need to be easy to apply, transparent in their logic, assumptions and limitations, but also flexible and adaptable to different empirical cases, while the knowledge generated should be directly actionable and easy to interpret by decision makers. Based on the opinions of the developers, the tools evaluated perform very differently against the requirements of decision makers. Most tool are easy to use and to adapt to the analysis of new cases, while the results are directly understandable by decision makers. This applies also to less important requirements, such as the provision of knowledge sufficiently complete, accurate and precise. At the same time, most tools appear unable to provide results directly actionable to develop initiatives. The only criterion against which all tools perform relatively well is that of transparency.
In the next steps of the research, we plant to assess the views of decision makers on the selected tools by conducting a focus group exercise with a representative sample of decision makers. Improved understanding of the limitations and potentials of existing approaches for studying SDG interactions is considered vital to advance their analytical validity and use in decision making and, ultimately, the usefulness of the 2030 Agenda as a means of national and global governance.",TRUE,FALSE,Decision support|Methodologies|Survey|Sustainable Development Goals|Sweden,2020-10-27T05:57:41.076351,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-27T05:57:18.797436,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Lorenzo Di Lucia,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/citation/,seq8n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f946711b1ea1700dbc93c9c/,5f946711b1ea1700dbc93c9c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/seq8n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/seq8n/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/seq8n

Between 0.44% and 0.93% of the respondents who were surveyed either identified as transgender, identified with a gender that does not conventionally correspond to the sex they were assigned at birth, or identified the sex they were assigned at birth inconsistently with the interviewer’s assessment of respondent sex. These results corroborate previous estimates of the US’ transgender population size. Furthermore, these new questions’ implementations mirror the successful inclusion of other small populations represented in the GSS, such as lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, as well as Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus. Data on transgender and gender nonconforming populations can be pooled together over time to assess these populations’ attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and social inequality patterns. We identified some inconsistencies between interviewer-coded sex, self-reported sex, and gender identity. As with the coding of race in the GSS, interviewer-coded assessments can mismatch respondents’ self-reported identification.

We found that: (i) cross-level communication increased more than that of same-level, (ii) while within-team messaging increased considerably, meetings stayed the same, (iii) off-hours messaging became much more frequent, and that this effect was stronger for women; (iv) employees respond to non-managers faster than managers; finally, (v) the number of short meetings increased while long meetings decreased. These findings contribute to theories on organizational communication, remote work, management, and flexibility stigma.

It also tests for effects of legal cynicism by comparing effects in homicide and aggravated assault on the assumption that reporting of the latter is discretionary and police abuses may make communities reluctant to notify police. Using FBI data from 44 US cities, homicide and assault rates from 2011 to 2019 were analysed using an interrupted time series design and combined in a meta-analysis to calculate pooled effects. A meta-regression tested effect moderators including external investigations and city/county sociodemographic characteristics. With a conservative threshold of p ≤ 0.01, 21 of the 44 cities experienced a significant increase and one had a significant decrease. The pooled effect was a 26.1% increase in the homicide (99% CI: 15.3% to 36.8%). Aggravated assaults increased above baseline, though the effect was 15.1 percentage points smaller (99% CI: -26.7 to -3.6) than the effect in homicides. When outcomes were measured as percent change, there were no significant effect moderators, but when measured as absolute change, homicides increased to a greater extent when the death was subject to external investigation and in cities with higher black populations, poverty rates, and baseline homicide rates.

Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"We provide new evidence on the causal effect of education on health. Our empirical strategy exploits the reduction in access to college experienced by individuals reaching college age shortly after the 1973 military coup in Chile, which led to a sharp downward kink in enrollment for the affected cohorts. Using data from the vital statistics for the period 1994-2017, we document an upward kink in the age-adjusted yearly mortality rate for these cohorts, a pattern that we also observe in matched individual-level records for hospitalized patients. Leveraging the downward kink in college enrollment, we estimate a negative effect of college on mortality, which is larger for men, but also sizable for women. Affected individuals have worse labor market outcomes, lower income, and are more likely to be enrolled in the public health system. They also report lower consumption of health services, which suggests that economic disadvantage and limited access to care plausibly contribute to the effect of education on health.",TRUE,FALSE,Chile|higher education|mortality,2020-10-24T15:56:20.752263,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-24T15:55:55.385629,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,Authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/citation/,5s2px,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f930dcbb1ea17003ec99503/,5f930dcbb1ea17003ec99503,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5s2px/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5s2px/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5s2px

A broad partnership with 1,650 people from communities around 18 primary schools across Barcelona provided the capacity to obtain unprecedented high-resolution NO2 levels and an updated asthma Health Impact Assessment. It is shown that NO2 levels vary considerably with at some cases very high levels. More than a 1,000 new cases of childhood asthma could be prevented each year by lowering NO2 levels. Representativity of site selection and the minimal number of samplers for land use regression modelling are considered. Enhancement of community knowledge and attitudes towards collective response were observed and identified as key drivers for successful large-scale monitoring campaigns.

Policing is thought to be one antecedent to collective efficacy, but little empirical research has explored this question. Using three waves of survey data collected from London residents over three consecutive years, and multilevel Structural Equation Modelling, this study tested the impact of police visibility and police-community engagement on collective efficacy. We explored direct effects as well as indirect effects through trust in police. The findings showed both levels of police visibility and police-community engagement predicted trust in police. Trust in police fairness, in turn, predicted collective efficacy. There was a small indirect relationship between police visibility and collective efficacy, through trust in police fairness. In other words, police presence in neighbourhoods was associated with more positive views about officer behaviour, which in turn was associated with collective efficacy. The findings have important implications for policies designed to build stronger, more resilient communities.",TRUE,FALSE,collective efficacy|community policing|police presence|police visibility|procedural justice|trust in police,2020-10-24T15:55:23.653374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-24T15:55:00.644704,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/citation/,k7ren,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f92d4951017210037a44663/,5f92d4951017210037a44663,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7ren/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k7ren/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k7ren
