Different techniques such as thinking aloud or various probing approaches analyse the comprehensibility and interpretation of questions, uncover difficulties of respondents in answering questionnaires as well as underlying causes. A desideratum of this approach is the methodological framing for which we make a proposal in this article. Direct research interaction in pretest situations can be regarded as an act of understanding others in the sense of qualitative-interpretive social research. On this basis, we discuss the advantage of methodically integrated communication strategies of two established qualitative survey methods - the problem-centred interview and the discursive interview - for the development of a distinct pretest interview approach. It adopts the techniques of the cognitive interview and expands them by the essentially social character of processes of clarifying comprehension. We introduce the term Qualitative Pretest Interview (QPI) in order to avoid the possible narrowing of the understanding of pretest procedures to the problem of ambiguous cognitions. Finally, we reflect on the potential of this approach for standardized survey research.",TRUE,FALSE,Cognitive Pretest|Discursive Interview|Intersubjective Understanding|Problem-centered Interview|Qualitative Pretest|Questionnaire Development,2020-07-11T22:16:42.592711,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-11T22:16:23.451133,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/citation/,3mgqd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f085e31a42091006ac1faf7/,5f085e31a42091006ac1faf7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mgqd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3mgqd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3mgqd

We provide the first large-scale evidence on the impact of industrial robots on the gender pay gap using data from 20 European countries. We show that robot adoption increases both male and female earnings but also increases the gender pay gap. Using an instrumental variable strategy, we find that a ten percent increase in robotization leads to a 1.8 percent increase in the gender pay gap. These results are mainly driven by countries with high levels of gender inequality and outsourcing destination countries. We then explore the mechanisms behind this effect and find that our results can be explained by the fact that men at medium- and high-skill occupations disproportionately benefit from robotization (through a productivity effect).

The results highlight the importance of looking at the small-areas and show that there are many pandemics going on in Brazil at the same time, instead of a single one. The pandemic is increasing in the interior of the country, but we still observed several cases and deaths in the major cities and, as of today, very few signs of reduction in the spread of the disease.

Lab experiments have found that cooperation may emerge in part because humans have intrinsically egalitarian motives, meaning that they resist inequality even at some personal cost. But outside the lab, economic inequality is high and on the rise, yet survey data suggest that people do not prioritize policies intended to address inequality. If people are intrinsically egalitarian, why are dramatic increases in inequality not a bigger concern? One possibility is that most people care more about unfairness than inequality per se. Here, we report the results of a networked, online experiment designed to unpack the relationship between fairness and inequality. In our experiment, we create fair and unfair wealth allocations by experimentally manipulating two factors: wealth distribution (i.e., whether starting wealth is equal vs unequal) and wealth source (i.e., the specific mechanism through which wealth (in)equality comes about, earned vs random). Our results show that the source of subjects’ wealth has important effects on their attitudes and behavior: when subjects “earned” their endowments, they perceived their wealth regimes to be more fair, and they were less likely to cooperate.

A prominent line of psychological research considers human motivation as structured by the degree of perceived self-determination. Importing this seminal motivation theory into political science, this study tests whether motivation to engage with politics can be represented as a multi-dimensional construct where each type of motivation is ordered on a continuum of self-determination and has distinct ramifications for whether and how a person engages with politics. Importantly, both controlled and autonomous types of political motivation are theorized to energize people into action. Yet, whereas controlled motivation is considered to elicit short-lived and superficial behavior only political engagement that is self-endorsed or perceived as inherently valuable should lead to deep and self-sustained forms of political action. Although self-determination theory been proven useful to assess reasons for action in various life domains, using multiple, large web surveys from Germany empirical support for it is weak when applied to the political domain. Employing various model specifications on two iteratively revised measures of political motivation revealed that the four theorized dimensions of political motivation could not be clearly distinguished from each other. Moreover, despite some evidence for the functional significance of perceived self-determination in the political domain the theory’s predictions received no consistent empirical support. This study therefore informs scholars of self-determination theory about the framework’s boundary conditions and scholars of political participation about theoretical dead-ends and potential avenues of further research.",TRUE,FALSE,Intrinsic Motivation|Motivation Science|Null results|Political Participation|Scale Validation,2020-07-09T17:04:40.873072,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-09T17:04:10.382316,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GM4RV,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/citation/,w73f5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gm4rv/,gm4rv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f074bb1ca360e0032b056ef/,5f074bb1ca360e0032b056ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w73f5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w73f5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w73f5

The treatments are administered in the form of videos using a new ask-then-tell design, and the sample is gathered from a novel, high-quality source of online data. I find that receiving pessimistic information about inequality makes respondents more pessimistic about the state of inequality and more supportive of government involvement; on the other hand, the addition of pessimistic information about opportunity does not lead to any more concern for inequality or support for redistribution when pessimistic information about inequality is already present.

The Garbage Can Model concludes that ``organized anarchies,'' organizations characterized by unclear technology, problematic preferences, and fluid participation,  make bad and unreliable decisions. However, management theorists in the 1970s and 1980s also saw a glimmer of hope through the Garbage Can Model's gloomy predictions. Moch and Pondy (1977), for example, propose that garbage can decision making could be robust to environmental ruggedness, ``the organizational equivalent of an all-terrain vehicle'' (360). In this paper, I explore the hypothesis that garbage cans can be adaptively rational organizational design. Using an agent-based computational model, I demonstrate how preference conflict and fluid participation in decision making promote effective search in uncertain task environments. I show that the political gridlock and unstable outcomes that emerge as a result of garbage can decision making -- the very features of garbage cans that make them perceived to be dysfunctional -- can facilitate short-term exploitation and long-term exploration of uncertain technical landscapes.

Word embedding models overcome this problem by constructing a standardized and continuous “meaning-space” where words are assigned a location based on relations of similarity to other words based on how they are used in natural language samples. We show how word embeddings are commensurate with prevailing theories of meaning in sociology and can be put to the task of interpretation via two kinds of navigation. First, one can hold terms constant and measure how the embedding space moves around them—much like astronomers measured the changing of celestial bodies with the seasons. Second, one can also hold the embedding space constant and see how documents or authors move relative to it—just as ships use the stars on a given night to determine their location.

Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers. Early estimates of responses to the COVID19 pandemic offer insights into future implications of telecommuting for gender equality at work.",TRUE,FALSE,care work|COVID|COVID-19|gender|household labor|housework|inequality|telecommuting|time use|wellbeing|work|working from home,2020-07-09T05:06:20.670895,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-09T05:05:35.281659,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.atusdata.org/atus/|https://www.covid-impact.org/,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/citation/,tdf8c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cbafn/,cbafn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0516a73e184600dbc92b50/,5f0516a73e184600dbc92b50,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdf8c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tdf8c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tdf8c
