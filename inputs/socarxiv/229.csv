I argue that focusing on the rise of panethnic CSOs reveals an underappreciated mechanism that has mobilized Asian Americans and Latinos—the welfare state. The War on Poverty programs incentivized non-black minority community organizers to form panethnic CSOs to gain access to state resources and serve the economically disadvantaged in their communities. Drawing on extensive archival research, I identify this mechanism and test it with my original dataset of 818 Asian American and Latino advocacy organizations and CSOs. Leveraging the Reagan budget cut, I show that dismantling the War on Poverty programs reduced the founding rate of panethnic CSOs. I further estimated that a 1% increase in federal funding was associated with the increase of the two panethnic CSOs during the War on Poverty. The findings demonstrate how access to state resources forces activists among non-primary beneficiary groups to build new political identities that fit the dominant image of the policy beneficiaries.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian Americans|Community organizing|Latinos|Social policy,2020-04-04T17:44:00.602611,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-04T17:43:40.404826,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FFLUPBJ,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/citation/,n83xs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e883bfd4301660017a0e9bd/,5e883bfd4301660017a0e9bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n83xs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n83xs,NA

That is, perhaps, unless you work on open source software. Right now, global research communities are united to collaborate on solving the threat of the pandemic, sharing resources and knowledge more efficiently and effective than ever before, a process broadly described as ‘open scholarship’ (Dunleavy, 2020). This is essentially akin to how free and open source software (FOSS) communities have been operating now for decades (Willinsky, 2005). Recently, we participated in a “massively open online paper”, or MOOP, that explored the intersections between FOSS and open scholarship (Tennant, Agarwal, et al., 2020). Here, we want to summarise our key findings from that project, and place them in the context of the current outbreak. Critically, this pandemic shows us that many of the pervasive and systemic issues surrounding the evaluation, valuation, use and operationalisation of “openness” in scholarship can be extremely easily bypassed when the social demand and urgency is there, thus showing that the primary barriers towards open scholarship are inherently political and not technical.",TRUE,FALSE,Communities|Coronavirus|FOSS|Free Software|Global Health|Open Data|Open Research|Open Scholarship|Open Science|Open Source|Pandemic|Peer review|Preprints|Public Health|Research evaluation|SARS-CoV-2|Software,2020-04-04T17:42:40.654364,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-04T17:42:33.771624,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/citation/,5kdbx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8818f9d69735000cbe17b7/,5e8818f9d69735000cbe17b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kdbx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kdbx,NA

A longitudinal analysis in three European countries,"We estimate the degree to which socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in children’s language skills observed in primary schooling are already determined before children enter school in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. We use representative and longitudinal cohort data and apply instrumental variable estimation to deal with measurement error in test scores. Around 60–80% of SES gaps in language at the end of primary school are attributable to gaps settled before formal schooling, while at most 20–40% is attributable to SES operating during the school years. We also show that ignoring measurement error results in a major overestimation of the role of SES during schooling. Our findings suggest that the most effective strategy for reducing social inequality in school-age achievement is reducing inequality before school life starts.",TRUE,FALSE,achievement|cross-national research|inequality of educational opportunity|longitudinal analysis|primary school|social inequality,2020-04-03T18:52:30.366921,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-03T18:51:58.513762,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/citation/,yqt6n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e871ef31ab2430284e03f54/,5e871ef31ab2430284e03f54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yqt6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yqt6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yqt6n,NA

In this final part, we focus on the future. We argue that quantitative geographers are most helpful when we can simplify difficult problems using our distinct domain expertise. To do this, we must clarify the theory underpinning core conceptual problems in quantitative geography. Then, we examine the social forces that are shaping the future of quantitative geography. We conclude with criteria for how quantitative geography might succeed in addressing these challenges.",TRUE,FALSE,data science|geography|MAUP|quantitative geography|replication|spatial dependence|spatial econometrics|tobler's law,2020-04-03T18:53:02.077037,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-03T18:52:52.332278,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/citation/,sxrk8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6ex2f/,6ex2f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e86ef5ed0e354026db45945/,5e86ef5ed0e354026db45945,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxrk8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sxrk8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sxrk8,NA

With a massive reduction in tourism globally because of the health crisis, the industry will have to plan recovery and rebuilding of the industry with greater consideration of the biosecurity of customers. A critical element in the reorganisation of the industry will involve the increased incorporation of automation technologies. This paper adopts a supply-side perspective and elaborates on the opportunities that automation technologies provide to travel, tourism, and hospitality companies to mitigate the negative impacts of biosecurity threats on their economic performance. It discusses the costs and benefits of the incorporation of increased levels of automation, especially in regards to the benefits of the safety and health of the consumer. It elaborates on how the current pandemic would stimulate the adoption of automation technologies. Finally, the paper discusses how this fits into the business models of tourism-related industries and outlines the micro- and macroeconomic implications of the greater incorporation of automation into the industry.",TRUE,FALSE,Artificial Intelligence|Biosecurity|COVID-19|Pandemic|Service Automation|Service Robots,2020-04-03T18:54:09.445606,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-03T18:53:39.388052,TRUE,Elitza Stoilova and Daniel Slobodskoy are CEOs of companies that provide automation solutions for tourism and hospitality companies (chatbots and self-check-in kiosks),not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/citation/,2hx6f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e86de7f8140b4026542b0f9/,5e86de7f8140b4026542b0f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hx6f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2hx6f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2hx6f,https://doi.org/10.1177/1354816620946541
