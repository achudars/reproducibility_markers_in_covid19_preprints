Two decades after South Africa launched a world-leading legal framework for LGBTI protections, I argue that these media representations depict the growing inclusion of black LGBTIQ people as a process of bridging the supposed “gap” between homosexuality and African culture. This new “bridging the gap” script seemingly rejects the older, dominant script portraying homosexuality as intrinsically “un-African.” But I argue that it instead reproduces the “un-African” script in a new, liberal guise, offering inclusion to black LGBTIQ South Africans on limited terms that continue to obscure their embeddedness within African histories and communities.",TRUE,FALSE,African culture|African marriage|homosexuality|intersectionality|LGBT identities|media|same-sex marriage|South Africa|tradition,2019-05-12T15:51:46.884196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-12T15:51:31.085017,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/citation/,hcq9y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8duwz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/relationships/node/,8duwz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd799ee840cae001a6f9f5b/,5cd799ee840cae001a6f9f5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hcq9y/,https://doi.org/10.2979/africatoday.67.1.04,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hcq9y

To study the trade-offs between these two paths to influence, we use a game in which contributions may affect electoral outcomes and signal policy-relevant information to politicians. In the model, a campaign donor and two politicians each possess private information correlated with a policy-relevant state of the world. The donor may allocate his budget to either an ally candidate who has relatively similar preferences or a moderate candidate whose preferences are relatively divergent from the donor's preferred policy. Contributions that increase the likelihood of the moderate being elected can signal good news about the donor's preferred policy and influence the moderate's policy choice.

This is particularly true in science museums, and researchers have pointed to awe as an epistemic emotion that can promote science learning. We present two studies of awe in a science museum. The first study (n = 293) examined how awe—conceptualized as a multifaceted construct associated with positive feelings of liberation/connection, negative feelings of oppression/isolation, chills, and diminished-self perceptions—differed across museum locations and in relation to prior knowledge. The second study (n = 708) expanded the investigation to also examine the relationship between awe and critical thinking. Across both studies, we found that, relative to baseline spaces, vast, beautiful spaces elicited positive awe-related emotions (amazement, curiosity) and stronger awe correlates (chills, diminished-self perceptions); vast, threatening spaces also elicited stronger amazement, chills, and diminished-self perceptions—but also stronger oppression/isolation. In both studies, pre-visit knowledge was associated with awe experiences during the visit. In Study 2, we also found evidence for relationships between awe and skepticism and aesthetic thought, two aspects of critical thinking: Positive aspects of awe (liberation/connection, curiosity) were associated with more skepticism, and negative aspects of awe (oppression/isolation, disorientation) with less skepticism. In terms of aesthetic thinking, diminished-self perceptions were associated being able describe observed roles and actions, and chills were associated with being able to describe personal opinions.

However, parental wealth is often ignored in research on social inequality in education, or its influence is only considered at later stages of children’s educational careers. Our paper contributes to this research by examining the relationship between parental wealth and (1) children’s math competences at the beginning of primary school; (2) the development of children’s competences throughout primary school; and (3) children’s transition from primary to secondary school. We are looking at Germany, where the early ability tracking may make an early investment in education particularly important. Analyzing data from the German National Educational Panel Study, we find that parental wealth has a distinct association with children’s educational outcomes that adds to social disparities by other measures of parents’ socioeconomic status (SES). Our results indicate that children in wealthy households have higher competences already in the first grade. This advantage remains stable throughout primary school and translates into a higher probability to attend the highest secondary school track. Moreover, children in these wealthy households are more likely to attend the highest secondary school track, net of differences in competences and performance. Our results imply that ignoring wealth as a component of parental SES leads to an underestimation of the level of social inequality in education in Germany.",TRUE,FALSE,Educational Decisions|Mathematical Competence|NEPS|Stratification|Wealth,2019-05-10T17:27:51.397762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-10T17:27:29.205398,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/citation/,jbyhz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3ys6z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/relationships/node/,3ys6z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd54d04f244ec0021e3c050/,5cd54d04f244ec0021e3c050,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jbyhz/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2020.100483,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jbyhz

We propose for this purpose a method which quantifies associations between categorical variables when we compare groups which differ only in the distribution of a mediating variable such as education. This is analogous to estimation of indirect effects in causal mediation analysis, but is here developed to define and estimate population associations of variables. We propose estimators for these associations, which depend only on fitted values from models for the mediator and outcome variables, and variance estimators for them.

A review of the literature,"This contribution reviews the literature on the role of financial aid in enhancing university participation. This aim will be reached through three main steps. First, we describe a theoretical framework based on rational action theory that could explain the effects exerted by the different measures. Second, we analyse the main forms of financial aid developed by the policy makers in Europe and in the US.

Computational thinking describes a specific way of reasoning building on concepts and processes derived from algorithms and programming. One way to teach these concepts is games as an effective and efficient alternative. This article presents SplashCode, a low-cost board game to reinforce basic algorithms and programming concepts. The game was developed in a systematic way following an instructional design process, and applied and evaluated in a Brazilian public school with a total of 65 students (grade 5 to 9). First results indicate that the game can have a positive impact on motivation, learning experience, and students’ learning, as well as contribute positively to social interaction, relevance, and fun. Results of this study may assist in the selection of games as an instructional strategy and/or in the development of new games for teaching computational thinking.

First, the presence of women in formal politics has increased, albeit unevenly across parties and minority groups over time. Simultaneously, the capacity to study ‘political women’ has become supported through institutional mechanisms such as academic journals and communities of practice. Moreover, gender as a critical focus of analysis has been developed and refined. In the literature on women and politics, the shift from studying sex differences to interrogating gendered political institutions is especially salient. This institutional focus, along with recent intersectional studies of gender and politics, increases opportunities for cross-pollination of sociological and political science perspectives. In this review, I provide a brief history of the U.S. scholarship on gender and politics and map these relevant social, institutional, and theoretical advances. I highlight the value of recent intersectional contributions in this field and make the case for bringing partisanship – an increasingly salient political identity and structure – into intersectional approaches to gender and politics.",TRUE,FALSE,gender and politics|intersectionality|partisanship|political institutions|political representation,2019-05-09T16:03:27.505468,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-09T16:02:17.469083,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/citation/,yag7f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd32ce0f244ec0021e27d41/,5cd32ce0f244ec0021e27d41,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yag7f/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yag7f

This study focuses on the content of Twitter messages related to the 2016 terrorist attack on the Berlin Christmas market. We complement the collective sense-making perspective with the terror management theory (TMT) perspective to understand why people used Twitter in the aftermath of the attack. We use structural topic modeling to analyze our dataset of 51,000 tweets. Our results indicate that people used Twitter to make sense of the events and as part of typical reactions in TMT, that is, to validate their own worldviews and maintain their self-esteem. In accordance with TMT, we found that people used Twitter to search for meaning and value, show sympathy for victims and their families, or call for tolerance, but also to express nationalistic sentiment and greater hostility toward values and views other than their own. We further show that topics varied over the course of the attack and in the days that followed. Whereas in the first two days there were many emotion-related tweets and operational updates, subsequent days saw more opinion-related tweets. Our findings contribute to the literature on collective behavior in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.",TRUE,FALSE,collective sense-making|social media|terrorist attacks|terror management theory|topic modeling|twitter,2019-05-08T14:12:41.412945,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-08T14:11:44.806708,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/citation/,p47b6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd2d3fe8098e9001957e0cf/,5cd2d3fe8098e9001957e0cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p47b6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p47b6/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.05.012,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p47b6
