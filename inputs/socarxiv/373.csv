A matter of lacking social integration or pressure from significant others?,"In most European countries, the choice of college majors is highly segregated by gender. Only a small amount of students enrolls in a gender atypical major. Previous studies indicated that these students may have a higher attrition rate than their counterparts in gender typical majors. In this paper, I investigated whether this higher attrition rate is caused by lower levels of social integration and pressure from significant others. I built a synthesis of Tinto’s model of student drop out and Kanter’s theory of tokenism and drew on theories of comparative reference groups to test these hypotheses. Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study, which follows undergraduate students who enrolled in 2010, I conducted discrete time survival analysis. I found that men and women in gender atypical majors have a higher risk to switch to a more gender balanced major and – only for women - to drop out than students in gender typical majors. Low levels of social integration and disapproval of the major by significant others increase the attrition risk. However, these two aspects do not contribute to the explanation of the higher attrition risk of students in gender atypical majors.

How the system ought to be changed, however, remains unclear. This paper briefly reviews candidate models for electoral reform from other nations, before putting forward the parsimonious mixed-member (PMM) model. This model was inspired by the mixed-member (MM) proportional representation system, as currently used in, for example, Germany. It is 'parsimonious', however, in the sense that the number of additional MPs brought into parliament to reach proportionality is minimized. Like traditional MM, PMM preserves the individual relationship between every voter and an MP, and it eliminates under-representation of parties. Unlike traditional MM, however, it also preserves the incentive for parties to win local races, it avoids unnecessary dilution of constituency representatives, and it avoids misattributing spoiled ballots to major parties. As such, it can be thought of as an optimization of MM. A key feature of this model is conservatism -it modifies our existing system with the minimal set of changes necessary to resolve the most obvious problems in the current system, without creating new ones.

So, the present study deals with indefiniteness syntactically, semantically and pragmatically. These levels are related to each other and it is not easy to draw lines between them. The study aims at (1)Pointing  out how the concept of indefiniteness is expressed grammatically in English and Arabic, and show the role of articles in expressing the concept.(2)Showing the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic uses of the indefinite expression in English and Arabic.(3)Identifying the similarity and difference between the two languages at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels which may help to get a common core that contributes to the belief in the existence of language universals. The procedures followed in this study include an introduction about the concept of indefiniteness, and a brief survey of indefiniteness in thirty-one languages to show how this concept is expressed in them. Then, indefiniteness in English and Arabic is dealt with at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels. This is followed by a contrastive analysis to point out the similarities and differences between the two languages.
The study has come to the conclusion that, in English, the indefinite feature exists in the noun, not in the article, and the article has a syntactic function rather than a semantic one. The study shows also that, semantically, indefiniteness in English and Arabic is almost the same, and its function is internal to the language system. Syntactically and pragmatically, indefiniteness in Arabic is more powerful and active than it is in English. Syntactically, the indefinite item is obligatory in certain positions to perform different functions.

Additionally, the overall achievement in English language among the majority of Saudi students, after completing six years of studying EFL extensively, is remarkably low (AL-Karood, 2006; Al Buna’yan, 2003; Al Guaid, 1997; Abuammah, 2002). This research paper will investigate, discuss and analyse the NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) concepts; change and modelling, as well as NLP four principles; outcomes, rapport, sensory acuity and flexibility, in order to specify the actual extent to which these concepts and principles can assist the Saudi EFL students to achieve better, easier and faster performance in learning the English language. By the end of this paper, the researcher intends to highlight the relationship between the NLP principles and the SLA learning strategies (O’Malley, 1990), as well as to attempt to describe some possible ways for applying the NLP principles into SLA.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-14T22:22:22.025183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14T22:22:09.443802,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/citation/,29wgb,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da0264e26eb50000e7fb27f/,5da0264e26eb50000e7fb27f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29wgb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/29wgb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/29wgb,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.242

Hence, this paper addresses the following question: how should the methodology course be reformulated to render it more efficient in raising students’ awareness of this issue? An analysis of some research methods manuals currently in use reveals that two major obstacles hinder students ‘ability to learn this issue: the pluralistic nature of applied linguistics and the rampant use of mixed methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, this paper proposes a teaching strategy consisting of focusing the initial phase on a contrastive analysis of two methods, which stand at extreme positions on the methodological continuum in applied linguistics, namely, experimental design and ethnography. Moreover, given that the presentation of the differences between these two methods is not sufficient, the paper argues that this presentation should be reinforced by a foregrounding of the essential differences in problem statement in the two research traditions in question. The paper concludes with some recommendations on the appropriate way to implement the proposed teaching strategy.",TRUE,FALSE,applied linguistics|ethnography|experimental design|problem statement|Research methods,2019-10-14T22:23:03.326411,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14T22:22:35.069455,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/citation/,t9xz3,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da02535a7bc73000dec8dfc/,5da02535a7bc73000dec8dfc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t9xz3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t9xz3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t9xz3,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.32
