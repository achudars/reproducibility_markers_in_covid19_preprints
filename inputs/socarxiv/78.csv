In this model, an individual's cultural beliefs are formed in earlier periods of life-course and remain relatively stable afterwards. I present the formation and organization of belief systems as central channels that facilitate this stabilization. Since cultural beliefs form webs of implications that become more connected with similar experiences until an equilibrium point is reached, correlations between beliefs should become stronger and the changes in the structure of personal culture should decrease with age. Using four waves of nationally representative data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, I test these propositions through an analysis of religious belief networks from adolescence to emerging adulthood.",NA,NA,belief systems|cultural formation|religious belief networks|socialization,NA,2021-02-28T23:34:02.901276,"Dear Moderators, I am sorry for causing this problem, but I thought that the preprint itself will be locked for a while.

Consequently, such discussions have clouded the facts, resulting in a large number of factoids. According to these popular beliefs, very few farmers benefit (6% only), and primarily large farmers of Punjab and Haryana (and to some extent western Uttar Pradesh) benefit. In this article, we examine these three factoids and draw on multiple data sources to distil the facts. We argue that existing evidence suggests a more complex picture – (1) the MSP impacts 13(16)% paddy (wheat) sellers; (2) the geographies of procurement have expanded to new states including notably, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, and (3) Although, at the national level, there is a large farmer bias, this doesn’t imply exclusion of small and marginal farmers. In fact, majority of the beneficiaries are marginal and small farmers on both the extensive and the intensive margins. Further, we find substantial heterogeneity by states. Haryana for instance has a bias in favour of small and marginal farmers. We conclude that debates on the MSP and procurement must therefore take into account the changed geography of procurement and the profile of sellers and recognize the diversity of experiences with procurement across states.",TRUE,FALSE,India|minimum support price|paddy|price support|procurement|wheat,2021-02-28T03:26:06.321827,NA,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-28T03:25:38.809016,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://fci.gov.in/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/bibliographic_contributors/,ufw9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/citation/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/identifiers/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/relationships/node/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/files/,6039eb43035cf701bac82ad4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6039eb43035cf701bac82ad4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufw9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufw9k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufw9k,NA

The focus was on full-time, full-year workers, aged 25-64, who received employment income in 2015.  The workforce in the Health and Sales &amp; Services sectors totaled 5.5 thousand and 24.3 thousand individuals respectively. The occupational portrait, which was developed based on the Canadian 2016 NOC occupational classification system, revealed an active participation of Latino workers in activities enhancing sanitary protection and the economic survival of the Canadian population. Women, and established and recent immigrants as well as those reporting Central American ethnic origins were found among those who most participated in the economic activities of the sectors. The most typical jobs performed by Latin American workers were as nursing aides in the Health sector and janitorial (males) and light or specialized cleaners (women) in the Sales &amp; Services sector.

Building on person-group dissimilarity theories, we address this gap in the literature using a large sample of 4,215 Swedish students (aged 14-15) in 201 eighth grade classes.

Five characteristics are examined at the student- and classroom-levels: gender, immigration background, household income, parental education, and cognitive ability. Information on sociodemographic characteristics is drawn from linked survey and administrative population registers.

It does so in the context of one of the largest cities in the Global South, with a focus on shifts in support for personal use of violence via diminished perceptions of legitimacy. Drawing upon a three-wave longitudinal survey representative of eight neighborhoods in São Paulo, Brazil, I demonstrate that perceptions of overpolicing and underpolicing (a) mutually reproduce each other over time, (b) vary significantly by neighborhood, (c) increase after aggressive police stops, (d) undermine police legitimacy, and (e) contribute to more favorable attitudes towards the acceptability of violence.

Family background and graduates' career trajectories,"The literature on social stratification has paid considerable attention to whether and to what extent attending prestigious universities is advantageous for graduates’ labor market returns. This paper contributes to the literature by applying a more dynamic perspective in asking whether graduates from prestigious and less prestigious universities differ in their career progression across fourteen years since labor market entry. It further investigates whether graduating from prestigious universities pays off more or less for graduates from different educational backgrounds. The positive selection hypothesis suggests that students most likely to attend prestigious universities will benefit the most. The negative selection hypothesis suggests the opposite. Using multilevel growth curve modeling and the 1970 British Cohort Study (N = 939), the findings show no discernible differences in occupational prestige between graduates from diverse universities. If at all, there is a small Russell Group premium restricted to the early working career. This early Russell Group premium is only found among first-generation graduates providing evidence for the negative selection hypothesis.",TRUE,FALSE,Higher education|Institutional prestige|Intragenerational mobility|Life Course|Social inequality,2021-02-26T16:34:52.041728,NA,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-26T16:34:06.725113,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/bibliographic_contributors/,xch9m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/citation/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/identifiers/,wr2kb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wr2kb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/files/,6038c4d7035cf70145c7f57e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6038c4d7035cf70145c7f57e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xch9m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xch9m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xch9m,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2021.100585

These changes could alter inequalities in mobility and therefore contribute to many forms of social stratification. Relying on SafeGraph cellphone movement data in 2019-2020 we focus on the 25 largest cities in the U.S. and measure inequality in mobility between census tracts by using two indexes proposed by Phillips and colleagues (2019). These measures capture the importance of hubs in a mobility network (Concentrated Mobility Index) and neighborhood isolation (Equitable Mobility Index). We find that the pandemic affected mobility inequality in all 25 cities. In the earliest phases of the pandemic, neighborhood isolation rapidly increased, and the importance of downtown central business districts declined. Mobility hubs generally regained their importance, whereas neighborhood isolation remained elevated started and to increased again during the latter half of 2020. Furthermore, we estimate linear regression models with city and week fixed effects predicting changes in neighborhood isolation relative to 2019 baseline. We find that larger numbers of new COVID-19 cases are positively and statistically significantly associated with changes in neighborhood isolation a week later. Additionally, we find that places with larger populations, more public transportation use, and greater racial and ethnic segregation all had larger increases in neighborhood isolation during 2020.

(2010) describe in their paper, which has been published in the American Economic Review, that risk aversion and impatience are negatively related to cognitive ability. This topic is important because controlling for cognitive ability might be necessary if someone is interested in the link of risk preferences or time preferences to real-world outcomes.

We examine how access in North Carolina varies among demographic groups based on residents’ geographic proximity to potential vaccination sites in centralized and dispersed distribution scenarios. We find American Indians have substantially less proximity-based access in both scenarios; non-Hispanic Whites, older adults, and adults with lower educational attainment also live farther than average from potential vaccination sites. However, access increases more for these groups in the dispersed vaccine distribution scenario. Findings suggest programs seeking to increase vaccine access should focus on reaching members of these demographic groups.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 vaccine|equity|geographic proximity|health|hospitals|pharmacies|transportation barriers,2021-02-26T06:58:21.606461,NA,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-26T06:58:01.519663,FALSE,NA,no,Researchers wishing to use SafeGraph data for COVID-19 research can request it via the SafeGraph COVID-19 Data Consortium at https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium.

Examined from George Lakoff's perspective in the field of cognitive science, this dichotomy appears to be based on family-oriented archetypes which he labels Strict Father Model versus Nurturing Parent Model. Philosopher and developmentalist Ken Wilber offers an integral perspective contextualizing this framework within a process of psychosocial evolution. He suggests that the differences represent unfolding of stages of growth characterized in their early levels by a lack of compassion for outsiders but in later levels by greater empathy and inclusiveness. This can create consternation among occupants of the less developed levels who don't grasp the value of showing compassion to those outside their own group. Wilber also identifies a yet more enlightened demographic that manages to recognize conservatism and liberalism as guideposts on a psychosocial evolutionary journey.",TRUE,FALSE,brain|conservative|development|egocentric|ethnocentric|George Lakoff|Integral|Ken Wilber|liberal|mind|Nurturing Parent|Strict Father|worldcentric,2021-02-26T06:58:01.588353,NA,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-26T06:57:36.825935,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Speech and Rhetorical Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Patrick Breslin,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/bibliographic_contributors/,wb2c3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/citation/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/identifiers/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/relationships/node/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/files/,6037f6e944157500ab586f7e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6037f6e944157500ab586f7e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wb2c3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wb2c3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wb2c3,NA
