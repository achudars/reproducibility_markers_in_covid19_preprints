So, the present study deals with indefiniteness syntactically, semantically and pragmatically. These levels are related to each other and it is not easy to draw lines between them. The study aims at (1)Pointing  out how the concept of indefiniteness is expressed grammatically in English and Arabic, and show the role of articles in expressing the concept.(2)Showing the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic uses of the indefinite expression in English and Arabic.(3)Identifying the similarity and difference between the two languages at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels which may help to get a common core that contributes to the belief in the existence of language universals. The procedures followed in this study include an introduction about the concept of indefiniteness, and a brief survey of indefiniteness in thirty-one languages to show how this concept is expressed in them. Then, indefiniteness in English and Arabic is dealt with at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels. This is followed by a contrastive analysis to point out the similarities and differences between the two languages.
The study has come to the conclusion that, in English, the indefinite feature exists in the noun, not in the article, and the article has a syntactic function rather than a semantic one. The study shows also that, semantically, indefiniteness in English and Arabic is almost the same, and its function is internal to the language system. Syntactically and pragmatically, indefiniteness in Arabic is more powerful and active than it is in English. Syntactically, the indefinite item is obligatory in certain positions to perform different functions. Pragmatically, the indefinite item acquires additional meaning from the context in which it occurs.",TRUE,FALSE,articles|contrastive study|definiteness|indefiniteness|nouns|pragmatics|semantics|syntax,2019-10-13T12:32:22.222017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-13T12:31:56.971675,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/citation/,bceku,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da0278426eb50000e7fb890/,5da0278426eb50000e7fb890,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bceku/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bceku/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.244,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bceku

Hence, this paper addresses the following question: how should the methodology course be reformulated to render it more efficient in raising students’ awareness of this issue? An analysis of some research methods manuals currently in use reveals that two major obstacles hinder students ‘ability to learn this issue: the pluralistic nature of applied linguistics and the rampant use of mixed methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, this paper proposes a teaching strategy consisting of focusing the initial phase on a contrastive analysis of two methods, which stand at extreme positions on the methodological continuum in applied linguistics, namely, experimental design and ethnography. Moreover, given that the presentation of the differences between these two methods is not sufficient, the paper argues that this presentation should be reinforced by a foregrounding of the essential differences in problem statement in the two research traditions in question.

It also aimed at showing that having no exposure to English language culture alongside learning the English language itself will affect learners' understanding and production of the language. In this light, the study attempts to answer the following questions: to what extent is the culture of the English language present in the lessons of English language that are introduced to secondary school students? What cultural background do secondary school students have about the English language? And if they do have any cultural background, what is the source of that background and whether culture teaching enhances EFL learners' socio-cultural competence? We hypothesised that teaching culture to Algerian EFL learners will increase their sociocultural competence and improve their understanding of the language. This hypothesis was tested through conducting a quasi-experimental study with a group of eighteen students from Habba Abd El-Madjid Secondary School in El-Meghaier, El-Oued (Algeria) The final results revealed a remarkable improvement among the majority of students concerning their sociocultural competence and their perception and understanding of authentic English language.

However, phrasal verbs in English language teaching as a second/foreign language is almost non-existent. That is, English as a second language (ESL)/English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching environments, in the Arab world, and specifically in Iraq, hardly teach the meaning of phrasal verbs to students, and neglect teaching the correct ways of using them, despite the fact that they are an essential part of daily native English communication. Therefore, and due to the vitality of phrasal verbs to native speakers of English, ESL/EFL students should be taught and educated to be capable of understanding and using phrasal verbs when interacting in English because knowledge of phrasal verbs would normally lead to better English language proficiency and more native-like communication. Nonetheless, phrasal verbs are not easy, and students often find them difficult, because phrasal verbs carry a specific meaning which is not inferable from the meaning of its composing words inseparable form as well as other reasons which have been explained within this paper.  Hence, this paper points to the necessity of including phrasal verbs in English language teaching. Through implementing a qualitative approach, the aim, within this paper, is to identify and list causes of difficulty that learners of the English language may face when it comes to knowledge of English phrasal verbs, with regard to the spontaneous and fluent use of phrasal verbs by native English speakers.

The paper attempts to validate that aggravation strategies have been an integral part of human discourse. It demonstrates how people use aggravation strategies to exercise power over others in different communicative contexts.  It also exemplifies how power is vested in specific identities, and their role relationships in different power structures existing in the society based on their caste, age, sex, social standing, political or official identity, and how the power is exerted in the context of their social identities. The paper defines various aspects of aggravation, explains the dominant participatory identities, namely master   identities, situated identities, and discourse identities and analyses how these social identities exercise power through aggravation strategies in the dialogic discourses in ASB.",TRUE,FALSE,aggravation strategies|discourse identities|impoliteness|master identities|situated identities|social contexts of power,2019-10-14T22:28:42.273692,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14T22:28:24.534512,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/citation/,zmq67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da02064fcf91f00121e37fe/,5da02064fcf91f00121e37fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmq67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmq67/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.28,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmq67

The study applied a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. The participants were 128 learners at IAIN Palangka Raya, Indonesia. During the learning process, the first treatment group was treated using Focused Direct Feedback; the second treatment group was treated using Unfocused Direct Feedback, and the control group was not given any treatments or No Feedback. Data were analyzed using a three-way ANOVA analyses. The analysis confirmed that the focused direct of feedback gave a facilitative effect on the learners’ writing accuracy. In terms of gender, the learners' writing accuracy differed significantly different between males and female. In terms of cultural background, the learners’ writing accuracy did not differ significantly among each ethnics. There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by gender and the types of corrective feedback factors. There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by cultural background and types of corrective feedback factors. There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by gender and cultural background factors. There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by gender, cultural background the types of corrective feedback factors. To conclude, it was noted that gender and different types of feedback had a vital thing in increasing learners’ writing accuracy.

Therefore, the aim has been to identify those difficulties from an error analysis standpoint and identify the sources underlying them. An analysis of a written corpus of forty students' written essays was thoroughly conducted. Types of errors were categorized, and the factors that contributed to them were analyzed. The participants were English majors in their third year of study enrolled in an advanced writing course during the first term pertinent to the academic year 2018-2019. Three essays were given to each participant to write about two to four pages using the narrative, descriptive, and compare/contrast organization. A writing difficulties questionnaire was further employed. The findings showed that the most frequent types of errors made by the participants were: punctuation errors forming the most troublesome area, followed by spelling errors, preposition errors, article errors, wrong verb tense, wrong word form respectively. The findings suggested that writing in English as a foreign language is quite challenging for students. Interlingual and intralingual transfer was found to be the source underlying the most common errors.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language|error analysis|interlingual|intralingual|Saudi learners|writing,2019-10-14T22:30:21.046715,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14T22:30:05.420510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/citation/,cvnfh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da01e67f6b03e000e1bfc02/,5da01e67f6b03e000e1bfc02,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cvnfh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cvnfh/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.26,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cvnfh
