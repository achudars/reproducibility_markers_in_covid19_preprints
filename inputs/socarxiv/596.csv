Journal editors, in particular, have made a commitment to research transparency by issuing data policies that require authors to submit their data, code, and documentation to data repositories to allow for public access to the data. In the case of the American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Data Replication Policy, the data also must undergo an independent verification process in which materials are reviewed for quality as a condition of final manuscript publication and acceptance.
Aware of the specialized expertise of the data archives, AJPS called upon the Odum Institute Data Archive to provide a data review service that performs data curation and verification of replication datasets. This article presents a case study of the collaboration between AJPS and the Odum Institute Data Archive to develop a workflow that bridges manuscript publication and data review processes. The case study describes the challenges and the successes of the workflow integration, and offers lessons learned that may be applied by other data archives that are considering expanding their services to include data curation and verification services to support reproducible research.",TRUE,FALSE,data curation|data policy|data verification|replication|reproducibility,2018-07-02T11:50:10.494652,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-27T15:45:27.168139,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/citation/,cfdba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/akp46/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/relationships/node/,akp46,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae336f6bb99c00010498179/,5ae336f6bb99c00010498179,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfdba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfdba/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfdba,NA

A Comparative Analysis of Satisfaction with Work–Life Balance,"Part-time work is an increasingly common strategy for handling work and family—but is it an effective strategy everywhere and for everyone? To answer this question, we examine the satisfaction with work–life balance of workers in 22 European countries included in round five of the European Social Survey. Our results show that part-time workers are more satisfied with their work–life balance than full-time workers; the more so, the fewer hours they put in. Yet, we find an important gender difference: Women in marginal part-time work (&lt; 21 hours/week) are more satisfied than men in a similar situation, and conversely men in full-time work are more satisfied than women working full-time. Further, the societal context plays an important role: substantial part-time work (21–34 hours/week) is more conducive to satisfaction with work–life balance in more gender-egalitarian countries than in countries with low gender equality. Hence, a supportive gender climate and institutional support may entice workers to reduce working hours moderately, which results in markedly increased levels of SWLB.",TRUE,FALSE,Europe|gender inequalities|Part-time work|work–family reconciliation|Working hours|work–life balance,2018-07-02T11:50:10.329971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-27T10:49:23.871844,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",The authors,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/citation/,scpx6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j5vp8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/relationships/node/,j5vp8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae2da68bb99c00010491eeb/,5ae2da68bb99c00010491eeb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scpx6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/scpx6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/scpx6,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616696.2018.1473627

Local and National Factionalism in the National Organization for Women,"While the National Organization for Women (NOW) has endured over time, it has faced significant internal factionalism. In this article, I ask why some of these factions resulted in schisms, while other factions persisted in NOW over time. This is a critical question for understanding how organizational location and factional collective identities combine to produce different outcomes when internal conflict breaks out. My analysis of interview, archival, and secondary data indicates that organizational location influences factions’ independent collective identities, shaping what they want and their perceptions of opportunities to change their organization. Compared to national level factions, local factions also lack the ability to use NOW’s hierarchical structure to their advantage in their effort to stay.

So too in the insistence on the materiality of software do we find software studies bringing forth software as material thing that exists in and through space, in sites and scales as diverse as voltage differences in circuits, nation states, digital maps, and networks of computers. As geographic theory has long insisted, space is not just a container for software, but is actively produced by software in its various material, situated, and socio-technical contexts. Influenced in part by the exciting work that has developed in software studies in addition to geography’s own rich history of engagement with technology, a growing number of geographers have turned to software as an object of study, producing theories and methods to understand the relationship between computation and space.

This special section emerged from our effort to bring together a group of scholars working on geographical approaches to software studies at the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Geographers (AAG) in 2016. Spanning four sessions, presenters expressed a variety of orientations towards software, with diverse theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding how software has come to structure the world. This introduction is a brief summary of some of those approaches, but more importantly, it suggests some of the ways that software studies and geography might productively learn from and build upon each other. These cross-disciplinary discussions are important as we come to terms with the growing power of software in our everyday lives and attempt to build critical practices that not only study, but also build other ways of knowing the world through computation. Ultimately, we frame the discussions that follow in ways we hope will encourage software studies scholars to grapple with the spatial implications of software.",TRUE,FALSE,critical GIS|critical social theory|geographical software studies|GIS|software studies|technics|transduction,2018-07-02T11:50:05.658375,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-25T10:37:29.876635,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences,Nick Lally and Ryan Burns,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/citation/,pfh6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/48kxt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/relationships/node/,48kxt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adfbd47bb99c0000e2bc5af/,5adfbd47bb99c0000e2bc5af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfh6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfh6y,NA

On one hand, shared cognitive associations guide people’s everyday actions, and these actions comprise the behavioral trends that sociologists seek to measure and understand. On the other hand, these shared understandings often contradict behavioral trends. I address this theoretical puzzle by considering the empirical case of sexual relationships and school dropout in Malawi. Moving recursively between longitudinal survey data and in-depth interviews, I compare statistical patterns and cultural beliefs about the relationship between sexual relationships and school dropout. Interviewees emphasized ways that relationships render girls incapable of continuing in school, whereas survey data provide limited support for these posited causal processes. However, these shared beliefs about the detrimental effects of relationships for school performance have real effects: teachers, parents, and students act as if these narratives were true, and these behavioral responses sustain the broader antinomy between sex and schooling. This analysis reveals new insights into how cultural understandings—and the various ways people respond to and enforce them—contribute to the demographic patterns we observe using survey data.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|demography|education|sexual relationships|sub-Saharan Africa,2018-07-02T11:50:05.280671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-25T10:32:35.480448,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/citation/,zb4ec,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x4rh6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/relationships/node/,x4rh6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adf7e1e7f80a1001017c043/,5adf7e1e7f80a1001017c043,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zb4ec/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zb4ec,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122417720466

The initial hypothesis is that databases that rely on journal selection criteria for their document coverage may not necessarily provide an accurate representation of highly-cited documents across all subject areas, while inclusive databases, which give each document the chance to stand on its own merits, might be better suited to identify highly-cited documents. To test this hypothesis, an analysis of 2,515 highly-cited documents published in 2006 that Google Scholar displays in its Classic Papers product is carried out at the level of broad subject categories, checking whether these documents are also covered in Web of Science and Scopus, and whether the citation counts offered by the different sources are similar. The results show that a large fraction of highly-cited documents in the Social Sciences and Humanities (8.6%-28.2%) are invisible to Web of Science and Scopus. In the Natural, Life, and Health Sciences the proportion of missing highly-cited documents in Web of Science and Scopus is much lower. Furthermore, in all areas, Spearman correlation coefficients of citation counts in Google Scholar, as compared to Web of Science and Scopus citation counts, are remarkably strong (.83-.99). The main conclusion is that the data about highly-cited documents available in the inclusive database Google Scholar does indeed reveal significant coverage deficiencies in Web of Science and Scopus in some areas of research.

We investigate to what extent the Matthew effect drives the allocation of research funds. To this end, we assembled a dataset containing all review scores and funding decisions of grant proposals submitted by recent PhDs in a €2 billion granting program. Analyses of review scores reveal that early funding success introduces a growing rift, with winners just above the funding threshold accumulating more than twice as much research funding (€180,000) during the following eight years as nonwinners just below it. We find no evidence that winners’ improved funding chances in subsequent competitions are due to achievements enabled by the preceding grant, which suggests that early funding itself is an asset for acquiring later funding. Surprisingly, however, the emergent funding gap is partly created by applicants, who, after failing to win one grant, apply for another grant less often.",TRUE,FALSE,cumulative advantage|matthew effect|regression discontinuity|science funding|sociology of science,2018-07-02T11:48:50.096345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-23T20:28:13.610781,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/citation/,nur8p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t34qz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/relationships/node/,t34qz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5addd597b855b8000cfe0c64/,5addd597b855b8000cfe0c64,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nur8p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nur8p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nur8p,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1719557115
