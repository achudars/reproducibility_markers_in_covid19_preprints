Development projects worldwide are increasingly required to quantify and fully mitigate their impacts on biodiversity, with an objective of achieving ‘no net loss’ or a ‘net gain’ (NNL/NG) of biodiversity overall. Seeking NNL/NG outcomes can affect people because society relies on, uses and values biodiversity. However these social impacts are often not adequately considered, even when development projects mitigate their broader social impacts. This document outlines good practice principles for addressing the social impacts that arise from all losses and gains in biodiversity from a development project and its NNL/NG activities. It aims to:
•	Define measurable social outcomes from biodiversity NNL/NG.
•	Provide a framework for assessing whether the social aspects of biodiversity NNL/NG have been designed and implemented in accordance with good practice.
•	Facilitate closer working between all stakeholders involved with biodiversity NNL/NG projects, especially between ecological and social specialists, throughout a project.
The principles in this document are founded on international best practice that calls for development projects to achieve biodiversity NNL/NG while ensuring that affected people are ‘no worse off and preferably better off’. They are intended to set a high standard, which may be aspirational for some projects in practice. They build on existing literature and guidance, and reflect a substantial diversity of views captured during an extensive consultation process. However, we expect that they will undergo further refinement when tested in the field. The authors welcome feedback.
Development projects seeking biodiversity NNL/NG should achieve an outcome whereby:
People perceive the components of their wellbeing affected by biodiversity losses and gains to be at least as good as a result of the development project and associated biodiversity NNL/NG activities, than if the development had not been implemented. 
To achieve this the following principles should be followed:
1.	Measure change in wellbeing.
2.	Focus on affected people within the project’s area of influence.
3.	Maintain the desired social outcomes from NNL/NG throughout the project’s lifetime.
4.	Compare social outcomes from NNL/NG against an appropriate reference scenario.
5.	Exceed existing obligations to achieve the desired social outcomes from NNL/NG.
6.	Assess wellbeing for defined groups of people e.g. by gender or interest.
7.	Benefit the people who have been affected.
8.	Align the biodiversity and social objectives of NNL/NG.
9.	Achieve equitable social outcomes from NNL/NG.
10.	Avoid impacts on wellbeing that are deemed unacceptable by the people affected and cannot be compensated for.
11.	Design and implement social aspects of NNL/NG with inclusive stakeholder engagement.
12.	Ensure biodiversity and social specialists collaborate on NNL/NG.
13.	Implement effective conflict-resolution mechanisms.
14.	Monitor social outcomes from NNL/NG throughout.
15.	Validate social outcomes from NNL/NG throughout.
16.	Be transparent throughout.",TRUE,FALSE,Biodiversity offsetting|Economic development|Equity|Good practice|Net Gain|No Net Loss|Social Impacts,2018-11-06T20:54:45.275871,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-06T20:54:24.802673,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/citation/,4ygh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/che7x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/relationships/node/,che7x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be1b424aa2cc8001902a652/,5be1b424aa2cc8001902a652,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4ygh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ygh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ygh7

In the late 1980s, Dunnell proposed a solution to this conundrum. He suggested that wasting energy confers an adaptive advantage in highly variable environments. This hypothesis has been used to explain several instances of monument building but it has only been evaluated once and that study suggested it is flawed. Here, we report a series of experiments in which we used an agent-based model to assess the hypothesis while taking into account two factors that could enhance the adaptiveness of waste—restricted agent movement and spatial structure in resource availability. Waste was strongly selected against in most of the experiments. Two experiments suggested that very restricted mobility can select for waste, but this effect disappeared when environmental variation increased from moderate to high. Thus, our experiments also suggest that the waste hypothesis is flawed.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|Agent-based modelling|Cultural elaboration|Environmental variability|Evolutionary archaeology|Monuments|Robert Dunnell|Waste hypothesis,2018-11-05T19:46:20.687826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-05T19:45:54.835853,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,William Christopher Carleton|Andre Costopoulos|Mark Collard,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/citation/,zr5k3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gd6js/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/relationships/node/,gd6js,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be07dc85736490018865e24/,5be07dc85736490018865e24,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr5k3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zr5k3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zr5k3

For that purpose, we focus on explanatory sequential designs, where a quantitative strand of research is followed by a qualitative strand of research (Creswell, 2009). This is a common research design found in MMMR where quantitative results are further explained using qualitative methods (Schoonenboom, Johnson, &amp; Froehlich, 2018). For instance, a survey may be followed by in-depth interviews with individuals from the survey population to help with contextualizing and interpreting the results. We report how R Markdown, a tool for report automation based on R (Froehlich, 2018b; Xie, 2013), may be used to increase research efficiency when applying such designs. We strongly believe that the quantitative strands of explanatory sequential designs lend themselves to such automation in order to free up resources for the (often labor intensive) qualitative strand. Next to increasing research efficiency, this measure is also helpful in aiding practitioners that do want to apply scientific methods, but do not possess the necessary in-depth knowledge about (quantitative) research methods.",TRUE,FALSE,automation|innovation|research methods|RMarkdown|SNA|social network analysis,2018-11-06T20:56:05.058656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-06T20:55:46.024854,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4f|Education|Vocational Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Dominik E.

These participatory projects can be seen as a way to check the pervasive and potentially undemocratic role of expertise in society, by creating a public setting in which experts’ advice can be exposed and criticized, and in which laypeople can attempt to influence policy processes that would ordinarily be dominated by experts. This ethnographic study investigates the fine-grained human interactions as members of a New York City community board in a low-income neighborhood engage land use and housing issues. It finds that they can partially overcome the challenge of expertise by developing their own technical capacity, and that this enhances board members’ influence. But it also finds that members encounter difficulties that cannot be remedied by more technical capacity. First, board members who develop expertise still lack complementary instrumentalities, such as access to insider information. And second, they find it difficult to juggle performance of their expert role with other roles they must play in their deliberations, especially the role of representing the community, which is essential if they are to influence elected officials through public opinion.",TRUE,FALSE,Housing|Neighborhoods|Participation|Urban politics,2018-11-05T19:47:41.264941,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-05T19:47:30.567808,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/citation/,fwt59,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z7pje/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/relationships/node/,z7pje,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be0646f5736490019859534/,5be0646f5736490019859534,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fwt59/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fwt59

Genomic research allows new discoveries to alleviate human suffering but in turn raises significant ethical issues. In this context, public acceptance and engagement is a major determinant of optimization of genomic research. Therefore, understanding public perspectives related to genomic research is imperative, as it provides a foundation to address ethical issues which may be unknown to researchers and other stakeholders. Although genomic medicine and research has developed in Sri Lanka during the past decade, there is a paucity of understanding about public knowledge and attitudes towards it. 
Methods
This research, therefore, aims to explore the understanding, knowledge and attitudes of a Sri Lankan public towards genomic medicine and research, in order to consider more effective and appropriate ways of communicating about the risks and benefits of participating in genomic research. Twenty four participants will be purposively selected from a previously conducted Colombo Twin and Singleton follow-up study (COTASS-2). In-depth qualitative interviews with a semi structured topic guide will be used to collect data, which will be analysed using conventional content analysis.

A longitudinal study,"Violent ideations are increasingly recognized as an important psychological process involved in aggressive and violent behavior. However, little is known about the processes that contribute to violent ideations. This paper therefore examines the effects of dispositional and situational factors on violent ideations during late adolescence. More specifically, it examines the extent to which violent victimization triggers violent ideations. Furthermore, it examines whether effects of violent victimization on violent ideations differ by gender. This study uses data from two waves of the Zurich Project on the Social Development from Childhood into Adulthood (z-proso; n= 1,465). Full-information maximum likelihood regressions are used to regress violent ideations at age 17 on social and psychological characteristics measured at age 15 and reports of previous year violent victimization measured at age 17. The results show that violent ideations at age 17 are strongly influenced by violent thoughts, aggressive behavior, violent media consumption, moral neutralization of violence, and internalizing symptoms measured at age 15. Moreover, victimization experiences increase the likelihood of violent ideations over and above pre-existing dispositions and prior violent ideations. The effects are stronger for adolescent males than for females.",TRUE,FALSE,Aggression|Cognition|Ideations|Rumination|Victimization,2018-11-04T15:19:03.752734,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-04T15:18:48.792421,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology,Manuel Eisner|Daniela Kaiser|Aja Louise Murray|Amy Nivette|Denis Ribeaud|Jean-Louis van Gelder|Margit Averdijk,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/citation/,93zv2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sc7yh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/relationships/node/,sc7yh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdd7f2c954c62001ae54f7b/,5bdd7f2c954c62001ae54f7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93zv2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93zv2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93zv2

Despite this centrality, the exact definition of a neighborhood, as well as how and where to draw its boundaries, has remained unclear. And while these questions have generated significant academic debate, they have arguably little effect on people’s everyday lives or decision-making processes. Atlanta, Georgia represents a different case, however, because of the city’s system of ‘neighborhood planning units’ (NPU), which has shaped the city’s planning and political processes since the mid-1970s. But despite significant changes within the city’s intra-urban geography since the 1970s, the geography of the NPU system has remained largely unchanged.

As such, this paper attempts to harness the potentials of big data to rethink the nature and geographies of Atlanta’s neighborhoods. Drawing on archival documents, historic maps of the city’s neighborhoods and new sources of big data, this paper explores the evolution of Atlanta’s neighborhoods from the 1960s up to the present day. In particular, our analysis highlights the fundamentally fuzzy, fluid and relational nature of neighborhoods, both in the ways neighborhoods are defined by political and administrative entities and through the everyday lives of residents. Ultimately, this work calls into question the idea of the neighborhood as a natural, pre-existing, discrete and static spatial unit, and points to the utility of using new sources of data and analytical techniques for revealing this underlying relationality.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|neighborhoods|spatial theory|urban geography,2018-11-04T15:15:41.217171,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-04T15:15:24.032283,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/citation/,vmrnf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p9w2b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/relationships/node/,p9w2b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd206f38b33000019201f9f/,5bd206f38b33000019201f9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vmrnf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vmrnf

While the smart citizen is most often seen as a kind of foil for those more stereotypically top-down, neoliberal, and repressive visions of the smart city that have been widely critiqued within the literature, this paper argues for an attention to the ‘actually existing smart citizen’, which plays a much messier and more ambivalent role in practice. This paper proposes the dual figures of ‘the general citizen’ and ‘the absent citizen’ as a heuristic for thinking about how the lines of inclusion and exclusion are drawn for citizens, both discursively and materially, in the actual making of the smart city. These figures are meant to highlight how the universal and unspecified figure of ‘the citizen’ is discursively deployed to justify smart city policies, while at the same time, actual citizens remain largely excluded from such decision and policy-making processes. Using a case study of Atlanta, Georgia and its ongoing smart cities initiatives, we argue that while the participation of citizens is crucial to any truly democratic mode of urban governance, the emerging discourse around the promise of smart citizenship fails to capture the realities of how citizens are actually discussed and enrolled in the making of these policies.",TRUE,FALSE,smart cities|urban geography|urban planning,2018-11-04T15:20:44.326109,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-04T15:20:18.767868,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/citation/,6fcet,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gp5vy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/relationships/node/,gp5vy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0dfaa40f461a000cb95084/,5b0dfaa40f461a000cb95084,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6fcet/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6fcet
