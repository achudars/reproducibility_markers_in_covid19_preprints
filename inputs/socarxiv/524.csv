So too in the insistence on the materiality of software do we find software studies bringing forth software as material thing that exists in and through space, in sites and scales as diverse as voltage differences in circuits, nation states, digital maps, and networks of computers. As geographic theory has long insisted, space is not just a container for software, but is actively produced by software in its various material, situated, and socio-technical contexts. Influenced in part by the exciting work that has developed in software studies in addition to geography’s own rich history of engagement with technology, a growing number of geographers have turned to software as an object of study, producing theories and methods to understand the relationship between computation and space.

This special section emerged from our effort to bring together a group of scholars working on geographical approaches to software studies at the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Geographers (AAG) in 2016. Spanning four sessions, presenters expressed a variety of orientations towards software, with diverse theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding how software has come to structure the world. This introduction is a brief summary of some of those approaches, but more importantly, it suggests some of the ways that software studies and geography might productively learn from and build upon each other. These cross-disciplinary discussions are important as we come to terms with the growing power of software in our everyday lives and attempt to build critical practices that not only study, but also build other ways of knowing the world through computation. Ultimately, we frame the discussions that follow in ways we hope will encourage software studies scholars to grapple with the spatial implications of software.",TRUE,FALSE,critical GIS|critical social theory|geographical software studies|GIS|software studies|technics|transduction,2018-07-02T11:50:05.658375,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-25T10:37:29.876635,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences,Nick Lally and Ryan Burns,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/citation/,pfh6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/48kxt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/relationships/node/,48kxt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adfbd47bb99c0000e2bc5af/,5adfbd47bb99c0000e2bc5af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfh6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfh6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfh6y,NA

On one hand, shared cognitive associations guide people’s everyday actions, and these actions comprise the behavioral trends that sociologists seek to measure and understand. On the other hand, these shared understandings often contradict behavioral trends. I address this theoretical puzzle by considering the empirical case of sexual relationships and school dropout in Malawi. Moving recursively between longitudinal survey data and in-depth interviews, I compare statistical patterns and cultural beliefs about the relationship between sexual relationships and school dropout. Interviewees emphasized ways that relationships render girls incapable of continuing in school, whereas survey data provide limited support for these posited causal processes. However, these shared beliefs about the detrimental effects of relationships for school performance have real effects: teachers, parents, and students act as if these narratives were true, and these behavioral responses sustain the broader antinomy between sex and schooling. This analysis reveals new insights into how cultural understandings—and the various ways people respond to and enforce them—contribute to the demographic patterns we observe using survey data.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|demography|education|sexual relationships|sub-Saharan Africa,2018-07-02T11:50:05.280671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-25T10:32:35.480448,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/citation/,zb4ec,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x4rh6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/relationships/node/,x4rh6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adf7e1e7f80a1001017c043/,5adf7e1e7f80a1001017c043,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb4ec/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zb4ec/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zb4ec,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122417720466

The initial hypothesis is that databases that rely on journal selection criteria for their document coverage may not necessarily provide an accurate representation of highly-cited documents across all subject areas, while inclusive databases, which give each document the chance to stand on its own merits, might be better suited to identify highly-cited documents. To test this hypothesis, an analysis of 2,515 highly-cited documents published in 2006 that Google Scholar displays in its Classic Papers product is carried out at the level of broad subject categories, checking whether these documents are also covered in Web of Science and Scopus, and whether the citation counts offered by the different sources are similar. The results show that a large fraction of highly-cited documents in the Social Sciences and Humanities (8.6%-28.2%) are invisible to Web of Science and Scopus. In the Natural, Life, and Health Sciences the proportion of missing highly-cited documents in Web of Science and Scopus is much lower. Furthermore, in all areas, Spearman correlation coefficients of citation counts in Google Scholar, as compared to Web of Science and Scopus citation counts, are remarkably strong (.83-.99). The main conclusion is that the data about highly-cited documents available in the inclusive database Google Scholar does indeed reveal significant coverage deficiencies in Web of Science and Scopus in some areas of research. Therefore, using these selective databases to compute bibliometric indicators based on counts of highly-cited documents might produce biased assessments in poorly covered areas.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic journals|Classic Papers|Coverage|Google Scholar|Highly-cited documents|Scopus|Web of Science,2018-07-02T11:50:04.025133,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-25T10:31:36.695020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/citation/,hcx27,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/29tdb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/relationships/node/,29tdb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adf0364bfd60c00117fc578/,5adf0364bfd60c00117fc578,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcx27/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hcx27/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hcx27,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2820-9

We investigate to what extent the Matthew effect drives the allocation of research funds. To this end, we assembled a dataset containing all review scores and funding decisions of grant proposals submitted by recent PhDs in a €2 billion granting program. Analyses of review scores reveal that early funding success introduces a growing rift, with winners just above the funding threshold accumulating more than twice as much research funding (€180,000) during the following eight years as nonwinners just below it. We find no evidence that winners’ improved funding chances in subsequent competitions are due to achievements enabled by the preceding grant, which suggests that early funding itself is an asset for acquiring later funding.

Scholars debate whether this inequality stems from racial differences in human capital (e.g. college selectivity, GPA, college major) or employer discrimination against black job candidates.  However, limited measures of human capital and the inherent difficulties in measuring discrimination using observational data make determining the cause of racial differences in labor market outcomes a difficult endeavor.  In this research, I examine employment opportunities for white and black graduates of elite top-ranked universities versus high-ranked but less selective institutions.  Using an audit design, I create matched candidate pairs and apply for 1,008 jobs on a national job search website.  I also exploit existing birth record data in selecting names to control for differences across social class within racialized names.  The results show that although a credential from an elite university results in more employer responses for all candidates, black candidates from elite universities only do as well as white candidates from less selective universities.  Moreover, race results in a double penalty: when employers respond to black candidates it is for jobs with lower starting salaries and lower prestige than those of white peers.

To address the question in an effective manner the type of leader being addressed is narrowed to exclude outliers such as extremely good, bad, or ineffective leaders. The types of decisions that they face is also narrowed to abstract external factors. Hobfoll's Conservation of Resources (COR) theory is then used as a framework to explain why a leader would abrogate or transfer their decision making. From this analysis which applies depletion of resources specifically to the case of the leader, I propose that there is a primary and secondary decision process, which incurs additional depletion for the case of the leader. The conclusion is that leaders who are otherwise competent and effective are liable to be depleted in their resources, which then would incur a higher cost in resources to resolve at the very moment when they are depleted of resources.",TRUE,FALSE,Conservation of Resesources|COR|Decision abrogation|depletion|leader|leadership,2018-07-02T11:48:47.979466,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-22T21:38:50.009458,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/citation/,xp5gn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4x2pg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/relationships/node/,4x2pg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adce5c1b855b8000efd3f9b/,5adce5c1b855b8000efd3f9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xp5gn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xp5gn,NA

After balancing selection factors that influence premarital cohabitation through propensity score matching, the author uses Cox proportional hazards models to examine the selection, causation, and diffusion perspectives on the relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution. The results show that premarital cohabitation is positively associated with divorce for those married in the early‐reform period (1980–1994) when cohabitation was uncommon. However, this relationship disappears for those married in the late‐reform period (1995–2010) when cohabitation became more prevalent. The findings suggest variation in the link between premarital cohabitation and divorce across different marriage cohorts and provide strong evidence for the diffusion perspective in postreform China. Supplemental sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the conclusion.",TRUE,FALSE,China|cohabitation|divorce|family,2018-07-02T11:48:47.344308,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-21T23:59:33.602218,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Yongjun Zhang,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/citation/,gsjf9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ewt4m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/relationships/node/,ewt4m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adbbdcbb855b8000ffdd06b/,5adbbdcbb855b8000ffdd06b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gsjf9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gsjf9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gsjf9,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12419
