Results show that unusually devastating tornadoes occur anywhere tornadoes occur in the United States, but rural areas across the Southeast appear to be most frequented. Five examples of unusually devastating tornadoes impacting four communities are examined in more detail.

We show that despite the upheaval, the core pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm remains relatively intact: central bankers believe that they should primarily pursue price stability through targeting low inflation in a transparent manner, and that they need operational independence to achieve this goal. In a bid to address post-crisis conditions and maintain their credibility, however, central bankers have also layered new elements onto the old core.

This study takes issue with unidirectional approaches to researching paratexts in terms of linguistic or sociological accounts, and argues for a bidirectional understanding of paratext to unearth the interplay between structure and agency. Drawing on Genette’s paratextual features and Bourdieu’s sociology, this interactive approach is explored in a series of analyses of paratexts enveloping two Arabic translations of Gibran’s The Earth Gods.

How Conservative Values Affect Helping Behavior towards Friends,"Individualism operates as a dominant ideology in American society, so how does individualism pervade both people’s larger views on society as well as their dyadic relationships? Do world views about the value of hard work and if people deserve help permeate the private sphere in tangible ways? I propose a relationship between individualistic tendencies and the frequency with which individuals help their friends and family who are feeling depressed. I hypothesize that the more the respondent believes that those in need have to learn to take care of themselves, the less frequently they will help a relative, friend, or neighbor who is a bit down or depressed by talking to them. I also hypothesize that the more the respondent believes that people get ahead by their own hard work, the less frequently they will engage in this helping behavior. Finally, I hypothesize that the more conservative the respondent is, the less frequently they will engage in this helping behavior. I test the relationship between these typically conservative values and helping behavior using a sample of 828 respondents from the 2014 General Social Survey (GSS) dataset, controlling for gender, race, age, and education. Results from bivariate and OLS regression analyses report that there is no statistically significant relationship between conservative values and helping behavior, so the hypotheses are not supported. Instead, two control variables impact the dependent variable. Gender has the strongest effect on the frequency with which one helps a relative, friend, or neighbor who is feeling depressed, followed by race.

Drawing on two contrasting theories: the theory of group interests and class-based theories of 
stratification put forth by Wilson and Shelton (2006), I propose that African -Americans who 
report being of a high socio-economic class are more likely to be Republican than African 
Americans of a lower socio-economic class. Through secondary analysis of data provided by the 
General Social Survey (GSS), I investigate the relationship between political party affiliation and 
social class in the African-American community. By combining data across 20 years between 
1996 and 2016, the sample size is 1557 African-Americans. Measures of socio-economic status 
are limited to a single variable that asks respondents about their subjective social class, while the 
dependent variable was operationalized by a variable that inquires the respondent's political party 
affiliation. Multiple regression analysis reveals that there is no statistically significant 
relationship between social class and political party affiliation. There is however, a relationship 
between political party affiliation and another measure of social class, specifically the 
respondents' level of education. The strongest predictor of political party affiliation is the age of 
the respondents which gives insight on future voting patterns in the African-American 
community. While the hypothesis is not supported, the results shed light on the potential reasons 
for increased support for the Republican Party among African-Americans and could be used to 
predict voting outcomes among African-Americans for future elections.",TRUE,FALSE,Class|Political Party Affiliations|Race,2018-12-25T14:51:41.719096,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-25T14:51:16.546880,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/citation/,q659n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1eaab77cd9be001b5c3ef5/,5c1eaab77cd9be001b5c3ef5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q659n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q659n,NA

The Effect of Cultural and Social Capital on Mental Health,"Does social and cultural capital have beneficial outcomes that extend to the mental well-being of First Generation College graduates? Obtaining higher levels of educational degrees is known to produce positive rewards in lifestyle, opportunities, and income. Educational mobility is directly linked to social mobility. As one climbs the social ladder, one builds a broader network of people to rely on. This study analyzes 2010-2014 General Social Survey (GSS) data to report on the relationship between first-generation graduate status and self-reported days of mental health among 1654 non-institutionalized respondents in the U.S. All the parents of the respondents in the subset did not have a college degree of any kind. I hypothesize that among individuals whose parents do not have a college degree, first-generation college graduates (FGCG) are more likely to report less days of poor mental health than respondents with no college degree. The results support the hypothesis. Being a FGCG decreases the amount of days of poor mental well-being. In this study I make the connection that acquiring social and cultural capital is an effect of FGCG status. However, age appears to have a significant effect on the number of days of poor mental health, as well.

In so doing, the resulting impact of a strategic policy mix can be greater than the sum of the individual policies of its individual parts. That synergetic potential can be utilized to attain strategic objectives. This is the case when it comes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. However, identifying and quantifying these synergetic interactions is infeasible with traditional approaches to policy analysis. In this paper we present a method for identifying these interactions and assessing them quantitatively. We also introduce a typology of five classes of synergy that enables an understanding of their structures. We operationalize the typology by the use of pilot studies of SDG strategies undertaken in Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Malawi. In the pilots, the Integrated Sustainable Development Goal (iSDG) model was used to simulate the effects of policies over the SDG time horizon. In each case, synergetic interactions contribute to potential SDG attainment. We estimate the value of these interactions to be 2.8% of GDP for Côte d’Ivoire, 4.4% for Malawi, and 0.7% for Senegal. We conclude that enhanced understanding of synergies in sustainable development planning can contribute to progress on the SDGs – and set free substantial amounts of resources.",TRUE,FALSE,integrated policy|policy coherence|sdg|SDGs|Sustainable Development Goals|synergies|synergy,2018-12-25T14:53:03.075833,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-25T14:52:36.054667,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/citation/,jt6r7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4fh2k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/relationships/node/,4fh2k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1ea3d9bba2cd001b8a3436/,5c1ea3d9bba2cd001b8a3436,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jt6r7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jt6r7,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817276116

The Effect of Religious Attitudes and Behaviors on Emotions,"What is the effect of one’s religious attitudes and behaviors on the frequency of different emotions? I propose that a stronger religious affiliation and a higher frequency of attending religious services will lead to feeling happy and ashamed more often and feeling sad, anxious, and mad less often. Further, I propose that a higher frequency of prayer will lead to feeling sad, anxious, mad, and ashamed more often and feeling happy less often. I analyze the frequency of these emotions in 892 respondents to the 1996 General Social Survey, a nationally representative dataset obtained via face to face interviews. Regression analysis revealed that more frequent prayer leads to feeling sad and ashamed more often, and more frequent religious service attendance leads to feeling anxious less often. Demographic control variables are also found to have an effect on how frequently one feels sad, mad, and anxious. The results offer partial support for the hypotheses. Further research is necessary to reconcile these differences and to explain the mechanisms by which the relationship between religiosity and emotions operates.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-22T21:45:06.048432,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-22T21:44:47.686510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/citation/,ybsf3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1e75c8bba2cd00198a3d32/,5c1e75c8bba2cd00198a3d32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybsf3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ybsf3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ybsf3,NA

Data from the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Current Population Survey were used to investigate income differences between first, second, and third and higher generations of Asian Americans. Total personal incomes of a sample of 16,521 individuals were analyzed. The findings showed that only Chinese, Filipino, and Korean individuals demonstrate income differences between first and second generations, where those who are second generation have higher incomes on the average than those who are first generation. Education has the strongest effect on income for all ethnic groups. In addition, results indicate that Asian women have lower personal incomes than Asian men on average. Among older respondents, all but one of the six Asian ethnic groups have higher personal incomes than those of younger respondents. The straight-line assimilation theory is partially confirmed by the first and second generations of Chinese, Filipino, and Korean. The study also indicates that the paths towards economic assimilation vary for different Asian ethnic groups.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian American|Generation|Immigrants|Income,2018-12-22T21:43:41.800669,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-22T21:43:33.790975,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/citation/,zmrxe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1d92007cd9be001a5bb7aa/,5c1d92007cd9be001a5bb7aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmrxe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmrxe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmrxe,NA
