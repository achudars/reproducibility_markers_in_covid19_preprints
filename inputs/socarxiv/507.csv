For some scholars, the emergence of a decidedly self-referential mode of fiction in the early twentieth century is part and parcel of what defines this modernity. In Japan there was the ""I-novel""; and in China, Romantic fiction. The two are recognized as foundational genres that distinguished themselves from prior fiction by the adoption of a narrow autobiographical focus, extended psycho-narration, and a new vernacular writing style. At the same time, others have struggled to define these genres in more precise stylistic or formal terms. Edward Fowler once said of the I-novel that ""writing about [it] is not unlike pursuing a desert oasis...How is one to analyze a form that critics have debated for well over half a century but for which they have failed to come up with a workable definition?""

Both included a long term mission for manned space flights to Mars in the 2030s. Since that time NASA has shifted the majority of its efforts toward that target. Research on the International Space Station (ISS), for example, has focused on subjects like the long term impacts of microgravity environments. On earth NASA has focused its efforts toward a similar goal. Several projects through the Human Research Program have endeavored to research factors such as human health countermeasures, exploration medical capability, and human factors and behavioral performance in analog environments, simulating how explorers will inhabit and exist on the surface of Mars. One such project, the Hawai’i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS), began its first mission in 2013, sending six crew members to live in a 1,200 square foot dome for four months in the barren volcanic ash fields of Mauna Loa.

HI-SEAS’ first campaign’s objective was to research the nutritional and psychosocial issues of a proposed Mars food system. This study helped show that cooking and eating will be an important activity for Mars astronauts for physical and psychological health by improving appetites, building community relationships, and maintaining morale. The HI-SEAS team maintained a blog and youtube channel, documenting their lives and scientific pursuits. Much of this content recorded information about cooking and eating on the station, including a video series entitled Meals for Mars, a makeshift cooking show about producing meals with freeze dried and shelf stable ingredients. These psychosocial and nutritional results make an interesting comparison to the theoretical work completed at the Johnson Space Center in the previous decade.

In my presentation I will use NASA’s digital Technical Reports Server to look at documents from the Human Research Program in conjunction with the HI-SEAS blog and video archives. By using these materials as primary source documents, I will show how the development of food science in human spaceflight has shifted from theoretical nutrition to a more humanistic model, incorporating personal insights on the comforts of earth.

While this has been discussed in some detail in the context of  a single electoral district, many electoral systems of interest are based on multiple districts. Neither treating preferences between districts as independent nor ignoring the district structure yields satisfactory results. We present a model based on a multi-urn extension of the classic Eggenberger-Polya urn, in which each district is represented by an urn and there is correlation between urns. We show in detail that this procedure has a small number of tunable parameters, is computationally efficient, and produces ``realistic-looking"" 
distributions. We present applications to retrospective analysis and forecasting of real elections, and intend to use the methodology to help set optimal parameters for electoral systems.",TRUE,FALSE,electoral systems|Polya urn model|simulation,2018-07-02T11:56:42.691152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-15T12:55:48.911514,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/citation/,xpb8w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6tqbd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/relationships/node/,6tqbd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b234e58c9cb1b001048e702/,5b234e58c9cb1b001048e702,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xpb8w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xpb8w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xpb8w

Eight LIS professors and two graduate LIS students or recent alumni with interests in accessibility were interviewed for the study. Results showed that, although some faculty were novices, most interviewees thought it would be beneficial to teach web accessibility in a variety of LIS courses. However, despite the seeming consensus, discussion of incorporating web accessibility into curricula was rare. This study explores possible reasons for the marginalization of web accessibility in LIS. The authors contend that greater support for initiatives to integrate web accessibility into LIS curricula is essential for enabling LIS practitioners to comply with legal standards and with LIS values of inclusion.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|digital accessibility|libraries|Library and information science curricula|library schools|LIS curricula|qualitative study|web accessibility,2018-07-02T11:56:41.490244,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-14T15:52:34.757112,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5d|Law|Disability Law|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6c|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|Accessibility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/citation/,8sy6z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nx2s7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/relationships/node/,nx2s7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2187e886d8510012c2d8b0/,5b2187e886d8510012c2d8b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8sy6z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8sy6z/,https://doi.org/10.1086/689313,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8sy6z
