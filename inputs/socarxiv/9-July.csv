Studies investigating the characteristics of its offenders often rely on samples of convicted offenders, which are then biased by low reporting and conviction rates of sexual offences. The reliability of self-report studies of undetected sexual offenders, however, is threatened by underreporting of sexually aggressive acts. Despite these limitations, we argue that it is important to publish available data on self-disclosed sexual aggression to learn more about those who are more likely to report own sexual aggression and to further improve self-report methods. Based on a self-report study conducted in a representative sample (n = 4,693) of the Belgian general population aged 16 to 69, we provide lifetime and past-year prevalence rates of sexual aggression and report the characteristics of the events, including type, target, and the applied coercion strategies. A logistic regression analysis revealed factors associated with self-disclosed sexual aggression. Almost 4% of all participants reported at least one incident of hands-on sexual aggression. Men were more likely than women to report sexual aggression (aOR: 5.33 (95% CI:3.62-7.86). Furthermore, a history of sexual victimization was associated with sexual aggression. In most cases, the target was an (ex)partner or friend. About 4 in 5 perpetrators indicated that none of the given coercion strategies (i.e., force, threat, verbal pressure, or exploiting the victim’s incapacitation or the own position of authority) applied to the incident.

We investigate this topic using experimental longitudinal data on mentoring relationships.

This paper seeks to fill that gap by investigating patterns of past wealth transfer receipt for low-income versus other households in seven rich countries and assessing the contribution that these transfers, or their absence, make to current wealth levels. We find that households on low incomes are relatively disadvantaged in terms of intergenerational transfers received in the past, both in terms of the likelihood of having received any and the amounts received by those who do benefit from such transfers. The role that this disadvantage plays in the linkage between current low income and low wealth is assessed and evidence presented that it is significant. Simulation of a universal wealth transfer scheme or ‘capital endowment’ on reaching adulthood for two countries shows that such a policy could lead to a marked decline in the proportion of low-income adults with no wealth. This and alternative or complementary policy responses to these wealth deficits merit the most serious attention.

We find substantial support for generous leave offerings. Multilevel regression results reveal that being a woman, supporting dual-earning expectations, and realizing more family strains lead to support for more generous leave offerings. Endorsing separate spheres and intensive mothering attitudes reduces support for more generous leave offerings; although, gendered attitudes interact with one another in predicting leave preferences, too. Finally, country-level indicators of female empowerment and father-specific leave offerings are positively associated with preferences for more generous leave offerings. Overall, public opinions about fathers’ leave offerings across OECD countries largely support policies that provide opportunities for more involved fathering, but preferences continue to be gendered and linked to family strains and country-level contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Family Policies|Family Strains|Fathering|Gendered Expectations|Paternity Leave,2021-06-29T21:01:03.039780,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-29T21:00:48.816700,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA5900,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/citation/,dxy24,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60da2c00ef8b3f011abdb85a/,60da2c00ef8b3f011abdb85a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxy24/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dxy24/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dxy24,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2021.102540

We identified four methods that have been used globally to link fathers and children in administrative data based on family or household identifiers using address data, identifiable information about the father on the child’s birth registration, health claims data, and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).

We consider three possible mechanisms—stratified access to in-person instruction, stratified risks related to in-person instruction, and stratified parental availability to support remote learning. We use data from a national online survey fielded through Ipsos in December 2020 with a probability sample of 2,016 US parents with at least one child under 18. We analyze both closed-ended and open-ended questions regarding parents’ decisions about school-age children’s participation in in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 school year. After accounting for differences in access, risk, and parental availability, we found no significant racial/ethnic or SES differences in parents’ likelihood of choosing in-person instruction. Instead, access, risk, and parental availability were strongly predictive of these decisions. Our qualitative analyses further clarified how access, risk, and parental availability influenced families’ decisions regarding in-person school. Families with limited availability tended to choose in-person instruction because of the challenges of combining remote learning with full-time employment.  Meanwhile, families who had high-risk family members and lived in communities with high rates of viral transmission tended to choose remote or homeschooling, particularly if they also had a family member who could provide support at home.

Aims: This study aimed to test such hypotheses by describing pre/during-COVID-19-pandemic changes in patterns of alcohol use among the Italian young adults (18–34 years).
Methods: This study involves the secondary analysis of data collected in 2015 and 2020 from nationally representative samples of Italian young adults. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify common patterns of alcohol use.
Results: Five classes were found: current non-drinker class (CND), weekend risky (WRD) and weekend non-risky drinkers (WnRD), daily non-risky (DnRD) and daily risky drinkers (DRD). Results indicate gender-specific changes in the prevalence of the five drinker profiles from 2015 to 2020.
Conclusions: In support to the Availability hypothesis, increases in abstaining women and men were observed, however among men there were also increases in the prevalence of patterns characterized by risky drinking and related harm (Stress and Coping hypothesis).",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Drinking patterns|Lockdown|Person-centred approach|Young people,2021-06-28T17:51:19.692327,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-28T17:48:01.126509,FALSE,NA,no,"The data underlying this article were provided by Osservatorio Giovani© of the Istituto Toniolo di Studi Superiori©, and will be shared on request to the corresponding author with permission of the Osservatorio.",,no,This study was not pre-registered.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/citation/,xam72,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d9c8e931881a00f0636ddf/,60d9c8e931881a00f0636ddf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xam72/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xam72/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xam72,NA

Exploring political and media use predictors of exposure to Breitbart, Sputnik, and Co.","Alongside the recent rise of political populism, a new type of alternative media has established in past years that allegedly contribute to the distribution of the populist narrative. Using a large-scale quota survey of German Internet users (n = 1346) we investigate political and media use predictors of exposure to alternative media with an affinity to populism (AMP). Results reveal substantial differences between occasional and frequent AMP users. While both groups heavily use Twitter and Facebook for political information, occasional AMP users exhibit hardly any specific political convictions (except that they feel less personally deprived than non-users). Contrary to that, frequent AMP exposure is related to higher personal relative deprivation, stronger populist attitudes and a higher likelihood to vote for the right-wing populist party AfD. Against this background, frequent AMP use can be interpreted as partisan selective exposure whereas occasional AMP exposure might result from incidental contact via social media platforms. These findings are discussed regarding the role of alternative and social media in the recent populism wave.",TRUE,FALSE,Alternative media|Germany|news|Political information|populism|users,2021-06-28T17:48:46.792899,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-28T17:45:46.034353,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,Philipp Müller &amp; Anne Schulz,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/citation/,gvb39,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d9c32f31881a00e963bc78/,60d9c32f31881a00e963bc78,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvb39/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvb39/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvb39,https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1646778
