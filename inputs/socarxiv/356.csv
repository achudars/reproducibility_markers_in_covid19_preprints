The analysis employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to co-integration in order to examine both the short and long run dynamics among the variables. Furthermore, the study uses the Granger procedure within the VAR framework to identify causality among the variables. The model used in this study is found to be sound, a diagnosis of the reliability of the model reached by testing normality, functional form, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity, with stability of the model tested using a cumulative sum and cumulative sum square test, based on recursive regression residuals. The ARDL approach to co-integration reveals that real GDP growth positively influences energy consumption as well as significantly in both the short run and long run, while energy prices and technological innovation influence energy consumption negatively and significantly. The results ascertain that energy consumption and economic growth are independent of each other, and thus they support a neutral hypothesis for Denmark. Besides, both the technological innovation and energy prices are found to be Granger cause energy consumption. Therefore, the study suggests that Denmark should adopt conservative energy policy using technological innovation and energy prices as instruments to achieve energy security and protect the environment from pollution.",TRUE,FALSE,Denmark|economic growth|energy consumption|energy price|Technological innovation,2019-06-15T15:48:47.571768,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-15T15:48:22.127348,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/citation/,4m27y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9pxqb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/relationships/node/,9pxqb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d022e0a35988f0018de3ff4/,5d022e0a35988f0018de3ff4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m27y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4m27y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4m27y,NA

Data were collected from owners of MEs through face to face interview. A multivariate analysis and SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes were used as statistical techniques to assess the effects of mobile phone use. Results of the study indicate that micro-enterprises which owners were using mobile phone were having significantly greater benefits and financial performance compared to counterparts. A significant direct relationship between mobile phone use, and social capital and ME‟s financial and non-financial performances was found. A further investigation revealed that financial performance is also indirectly related to social capital and quality and enterprise processes, which are significantly influenced by mobile phone usage. Therefore social capital and non-financial business performances are involved in the mediational process between the financial performance of MEs and use of mobile phone. The novelty of this research lies in the establishment of, for the first time, high level statistical relationship between the use of mobile phone, its mediating factors and financial performance of MEs.

The historical CO2 emission performance data also indicate that the iron and steel, chemical, paper and pulp and cement were the top four largest industrial emitters, and these top four emitting industries contributed nearly two-third of the industrial sector‟s total CO2 emission amount during 1990-2015. Evidently, any appropriate efforts or strategies guided by an empirical investigation like this are expected to help Japan‟s industrial emitters move toward a more tolerable and less polluted carbon footprint, which is well-matched with the country‟s commitment to Kyoto Protocol. This study is thus an effort to empirically investigate the causality and long-run trend/relationship between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions and to propose some corporate environmental strategies using the econometric techniques of Vector Error Correction (VEC) and Granger causality. It found that there exists no Granger causality between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions in any direction. But the VEC estimation reveals that an increase in Japan‟s industrial production by 1% is associated with a 0.08% increase in the country‟s CO2 emissions. It also reveals that any disequilibrium between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions could take about 0.7 quarters for half of the error to be corrected for. The adjustment rate for Japan‟s industrial production is found to be positive but quite slow at the rate of 0.08% per year. Since Japan‟s CO2 emissions vis-à-vis its industrial production is found to have reached above the long-run equilibrium level, its industrial sector is expected to encounter with stricter government regulations requiring reduction of CO2 emissions to the targeted/equilibrium level in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-14T16:01:27.369118,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T15:55:00.277957,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/citation/,zb2dv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kqbr9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/relationships/node/,kqbr9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0228bd7b8c4d00189af71e/,5d0228bd7b8c4d00189af71e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zb2dv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zb2dv,NA

It is expected that the patterns of household resilience factors and adaptation practices have a strong linkage with household food security. The aim of this study was to seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the required types of support for adaptation to food insecurity among the poor and low income households in Malaysia.
Design/methodology/approach: This study was based on primary data that were collected in Jul-Oct 2012 through a questionnaire survey among 460 poor and low income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling technique. The study considered household food security as household food availability and food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to find out the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security.
Findings: The study concludes that several resilience factors and adaptation practices were statistically significant to household food security, and several external supports were statistically and significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food security programs needs to be integrated with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation programs, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial.
Originality/value: This study is a pioneer work based on primary data that empirically measured the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security in Malaysia. This study also discussed some issues related to the climate change linkage, which would help future climate change research.

The expanding role of experts and institutions in managing risks has come at a time of declining public trust in institutions and a legitimacy crisis around expert knowledge. What happens when these tendencies collide? Previous scholarship has examined how disaster arises through failures of foresight, and how cultural-cognitive biases can prevent actors from seeing disasters coming. Less is known about the mobilization of resistance against risk management policies. This theoretical essay examines a particular category of that resistance: conspiracist discourse that frames risk as emanating primarily from perceived secret agendas of institutions and experts that explicitly claim to be acting in the public interest. This essay argues that conspiracy thinking can be best understood as rooted in a “populist risk imaginary,” which is rooted in negative asymmetry, a cultural-cognitive bias that foregrounds the possibility of worst-case outcomes. Conspiracy discourse can be understood as the “dark side” of negative asymmetry, which is otherwise used by service-oriented professionals to sharpen their foresight in preempting future dangers.",TRUE,FALSE,anticipation|culture and cognition|politics|risk|the future,2019-06-13T12:03:42.928151,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T12:03:16.105162,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/citation/,7pj6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0225fd35988f0018de3baa/,5d0225fd35988f0018de3baa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7pj6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7pj6y,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12547

Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes primary data collected by a questionnaire based survey on 186 police officials of Malaysia including Sabah and Sarawak. Data is analysed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.
Findings - The results derived in the study showed a statistically significant positive relationship between three basic variables of the fraud theory – pressure, opportunity, and rationalization with asset misappropriation. Moreover, this study revealed that religiosity is statistically significantly and negatively correlated to asset misappropriation. Therefore, the higher religiosity of an individual correlates with the lower probability involve in asset misappropriation.
Practical implications - The findings will help Anti-Corruption Commission, Enforcement Agency of Integrity Commission, Police Department, and relevant agencies from Malaysia and other countries to design policies for reducing cases of fraudulent behaviour.
Originality/value – This study is an original work based on the primary data collection.",TRUE,FALSE,Fraud; Asset misappropriation; Rationalization; Religiosity; Ethics; Police; Corruption; Malaysia,2019-06-13T10:32:47.144894,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T10:32:22.923841,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/citation/,sy65n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h5gfd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/relationships/node/,h5gfd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d02252ee2124b0018385d58/,5d02252ee2124b0018385d58,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sy65n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sy65n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sy65n,NA
