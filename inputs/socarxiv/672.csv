Instead I should like to place the term ""Consciousness"" on a broader footing. I shall therefore proceed from everyday reality, precisely where we experience ourselves as conscious beings. I shall use the term in such a general way as to resolve the question whether only a human being enjoys consciousness, or even a thermostat. Whilst the difference is considerable, it is not fundamental. Every effect exists in the perception of a consciousness. I elaborate on its freedom of choice (leading to free will), in my view the most important source of creativity, in a similarly general way. The problems associated with a really conscious decision do not disappear by mixing determination with a touch of coincidence. Both must enter into a higher unity. In so doing it will emerge that a certain degree of freedom of choice (or free will) is just as omnipresent as consciousness - an inherent part of reality itself.",TRUE,FALSE,choice|consciousness|decision-making|determinism|freedom|free will|perception,2018-07-02T10:49:12.765989,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-26T11:27:39.347000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf9|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Mind,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/citation/,gygnx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7p88x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/relationships/node/,7p88x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5889dba7594d9001fb9fb35f/,5889dba7594d9001fb9fb35f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gygnx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gygnx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gygnx,NA

Yet investment in new parks can trigger housing price inflation through a process termed environmental gentrification. This can in turn potentially displace marginalized and vulnerable residents. In this chapter, we examine cases from Japan and Australia, investigating how informal urban greenspaces (IGS) (e.g. vacant lots, street or railway verges, brownfields, and power line corridors) could function as an ‘anti-gentrification’ urban greening strategy. Employing conceptual insights from political ecology and environmental justice, we use spatial and statistical analysis to test whether IGS is socio-spatially differentiated by (dis)advantage, and whether factors such as income and education affect residents’ perception and use of IGS. Results suggest that IGS holds considerable potential as a ‘just green enough’ intervention, because it does not appear to trigger gentrification as occurs with more ‘intentional’ green spaces. We argue that a key difference between intentional and informal greenspaces is the apparent empowerment of residents as co-creators, designers, managers and users of greenspace – not as passive consumers. Informal greenspaces may thus fulfill recreational needs while avoiding demands for a ‘return on investment’, a driver of environmental-gentrification. Insights from Japan suggest that planners and urban managers should identify and reduce IGS use barriers, provide better information (e.g. IGS maps), and work with residents to promote its use.",TRUE,FALSE,derelict land|eco-gentrification|environmental justice|participatory management|political ecology|urban agriculture,2018-07-02T10:51:42.365312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-26T01:27:41.902000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/citation/,mfa4w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4d463/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/relationships/node/,4d463,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58894e94594d9001fc9fb367/,58894e94594d9001fc9fb367,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mfa4w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mfa4w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mfa4w,NA

Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as ‘open science’, these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology’s Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology,2018-07-02T10:46:30.004392,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-25T20:35:16.253000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/citation/,72n8g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3d6xx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/relationships/node/,3d6xx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58890b92b83f6901f0a694ed/,58890b92b83f6901f0a694ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/72n8g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/72n8g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/72n8g,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3D6XX

This paper shows that drunkards, elderly and especially teenagers are more frequently seen as problem-group than any ethnic minority. Conditions of economic decline and out-group size are analysed as to whether they are associated with a higher likelihood to use ethnic categories. The findings suggest that the effects of out-group size are diminishing in their impact, whereas the effects of economic decline are accumulating in strength.",TRUE,FALSE,Ethnic Boundaries|Ethnic diversity|Ethnicity|Ethnic Minorities|Ethnic Relations|National Identity|Prejudice|SocArXiv,2018-07-02T10:45:13.128021,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-25T17:10:37.822000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/citation/,3pt8a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e2huv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/relationships/node/,e2huv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5888db5b9ad5a101f8af7689/,5888db5b9ad5a101f8af7689,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pt8a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pt8a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pt8a,https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2011.644311

But why do some people have more contact to their neighbours of other ethnicity? Using new data from a large-scale German survey, I analyse the brokering roles of children and inter-ethnic partners in explaining inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintanceships. Even on a contextual level, my results suggest that people living in regions with larger shares of children have more inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances, which expands earlier findings on the general integrating function of children. However, I also argue that we should recognise brokering to be context-specific and exemplify this by showing how the brokering role of inter-ethnic partners shows particularly in interaction with inter-ethnic encounters at local bars and restaurants, while that of children shows particularly given frequent inter-ethnic encounters at public parks and playgrounds. More importantly, the brokering role of children only shows in interaction with the frequency of inter-ethnic encounters at local parks and playgrounds. On a theoretical level, my results demonstrate the importance of studying the interaction of mechanisms in explaining personal (inter-ethnic) contact.",TRUE,FALSE,brokering|ethnic diversity|Inter-ethnic contact|neighborhood|networks|weak ties,2018-07-02T10:55:06.679103,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-25T16:05:15.818000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/citation/,zrnz2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/whs63/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/relationships/node/,whs63,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5888cb0fb83f6901fb519098/,5888cb0fb83f6901fb519098,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrnz2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zrnz2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zrnz2,https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183X.2013.778147
