These unknown media outlets are notable because they represent potential sources of misinformation and coverage with a distinctive slant. We use a large survey experiment to consider how source familiarity influences political communication. While this demonstrates the public is averse to consuming news from unfamiliar media, we show that—conditional on exposure to them—unknown local and foreign media sources can influence public opinion to an extent similar to established mainstream news outlets on the same issues. This comparable effectiveness stems from the public’s charitable evaluations of the credibility of unfamiliar news sources and their relatively low trust in familiar mainstream media.

The law and policy produced by the CoE and the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court immensely influence how domestic authorities address SMACs, so it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of this framework. Indeed, the CoE has acquired a progressively significant role in the field of asylum. Although it does not have an asylum policy as such, several of its bodies have taken a noteworthy role in this field, such as the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT). The Strasbourg Court, above all, along with the now extinct European Commission of Human Rights, developed a strong line of jurisprudence that applies the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to asylum claimants, despite the ECHR not possessing any norm explicitly related to asylum. More specifically, the Strasbourg Court was the first judicial instance at a European level to decide on cases relating to SMACs. It has so far dealt with at least 23 separate cases of asylum on grounds of sexual orientation. Many of these cases led to contentious and inadequate decisions, such as the 2014 judgment in M.E. v. Sweden, which gave legitimacy to the idea that applicants can be sent back to their countries of origin and asked to be ‘discreet’ about their sexuality. This approach reflects a worrying detachment from the realities of sexual minorities in many countries around the world and from their experiences when claiming international protection in Europe. This contribution thus critiques the CoE policy and Court’s jurisprudence in this field, whilst advancing policy and legal recommendations that can adequately address the socio-cultural and sexual diversity of asylum claimants from a queer intersectional perspective.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum|ECHR|ECtHR|Europe|human rights|LGB|queer|refugees|sexual minorities|Strasbourg,2021-03-08T14:52:48.888569,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:52:11.769186,TRUE,This  contribution  has  been  produced  within  the  context  of  the  project  ‘Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Claims of Asylum: A European human  rights  challenge  –  SOGICA’  (http://www.sogica.org).

It discusses the different uses of emojis in social media apps, investigates the reasons for the rise of using emojis in everyday social interaction, and to which extent the occurrence of this pictographic script can substitute the written language. A qualitative and quantitative analysis has been applied in this investigation where a survey-based questionnaire was distributed among 143 EFL learners in Taibah University in Saudi Arabia. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA (analysis of variables) are used to analyze the obtained data. The results show that the p-value of the study variables is equal to one which is much bigger than alpha and there is no big difference between the variables’ estimation in the participants’ responses, i.e. the emojis’ use in texting affects the use of the language. Moreover, the findings display that the use of emojis and short forms (contractions and acronyms) in text messages form a real threat to the standard and non-standard languages. The outcomes of this study make it clear this new sort of communication may replace mainly languages where social media users found that emojis best represent their feelings and thoughts. This research concluded that the use of emojis has an important role in interpersonal communications, however, standard writing skills would be negatively affected using these newly emerged communication tools.

This useful property can be used to assess whether some units (say, occupations or geographic areas) contribute more to overall segregation than other units. The related segregation index H is a normalized version of the M index, such that the index is constrained to fall between 0 and 1. The question addressed in this paper is whether local segregation scores of the M index can be normalized in a similar way, to arrive at useful local segregation scores for the H index. The paper shows that it is not possible to obtain normalized local segregation scores that fall between 0 and 1 and that also aggregate to the H index. The one exception to this is the situation when all groups in the population are exactly of equal size. It is also (trivially) possible to decompose the H index into weighted local segregation scores, however, they have the same problems of interpretation as the local segregation scores of the M index.",TRUE,FALSE,information theory|segregation,2021-03-08T13:51:06.757606,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T13:50:48.610679,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Benjamin Elbers,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/citation/,3juyc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60462719fbab5700d975d3e1/,60462719fbab5700d975d3e1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3juyc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3juyc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3juyc,NA

Using longitudinal survey data from Germany, I combine unconditional quantile regressions with wage gap decompositions to identify the effect of personality traits on gender gaps and investigate potential channels of the effect. The results suggest that the impact of personality traits on wage gaps increases across the wage distribution. Personality traits explain up to 14% of the overall gender wage gap at the top of the wage distribution and around 7-9% at the mean. The effect is mostly driven by direct wage effects (potentially through productivity or bargaining behavior) of certain traits that differ between men and women, while access to jobs and discrimination of women based on personality traits play a minor role.",TRUE,FALSE,decomposition methods|gender wage gap|quantile regression|SOEP,2021-03-08T10:11:02.092384,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T10:10:33.694328,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Matthias Collischon,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/citation/,m69x3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6045c12a51a4a600da771354/,6045c12a51a4a600da771354,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m69x3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m69x3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m69x3,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2021.100596

In this status quo, there is the rapid implementation of these programs, especially during the outbreak of Covid-19. Nowadays, many scholars affirmed the cooperation between virtual programs and language learning as they are overlapping and go hand in hand to cope with the immediate changes across the instructive institutions. This research will outline one of the fundamental topics, which is the role of an organizational platform to mitigate literacy and elevate the learner’s language learning level. Initially, it will entirely answer the core questions in this paper: What is the virtual platform and its significance in the education field? Then, it will demonstrate a critical understanding of the significance of the online platform to promote English language learning on some contemporary theories.

English as a foreign language is being taught in Pakistani government-run schools and in non-elitist private schools. The focal question in this paper centers on the several implications of the teaching process of grammatical concepts. The main aim of this research study is to find out the methods adopted in the teaching of grammar and whether these methods are updated with recent methods recommended in recent research on effective teaching and learning. The content analysis of books and review of teaching methods are used as methodological tools.  The results suggest that the grammar teaching methods are outdated, the text material contains misleading explanations, and lack understanding of descriptive linguistic concepts on grammar. The core recommendation is that the grammar teaching methods and text material in question should be reviewed and updated with a more up-to-date material. The significance of the study lies in the fact that it will shade light on the teaching practices of grammar and review updated research on the teaching of grammar, which need consideration in teacher training programs and study material design.",TRUE,FALSE,grammar teaching|Grammar-translation method|Pakistan|textbook contents,2021-03-08T14:00:34.754524,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T13:59:52.841164,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/citation/,kef5j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60459b63fbab5700b2760456/,60459b63fbab5700b2760456,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kef5j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kef5j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kef5j,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.28

Critical thinking, with regard to EFL teachers, has not been taken into consideration early on. This study explores the relationship between EFL teacher’s professional discerning and their critical thinking in Pakistani context. A quantitative paradigm has been adopted to find out if there is any relationship between EFL teachers’ professional discerning and their critical thinking. The participants consisted of 93 EFL teachers teaching English at the university level in Pakistan. The researcher utilized a professional discerning (identity) research tool taken from Sheybani and Miri (2019) and a derived Critical Thinking Inventory (DCT) designed by the researcher to collect data. To analyze the relationship between EFL teachers’s professional discerning and their critical thinking ability, the data were analyzed by R (statistical program). The results of correlation analysis unfolded that the sub-constructs of professional discerning questionnaire tools are predicted by critical thinking. A highly positive and statistically significant correlation was observed in the analysis. The study highlights the significance and important role of critical thinking in shaping EFL teachers’ professional discerning, particularly in their teaching context. The study proves the inventive conduct of EFL teachers in the present era of knowledge and learning. The study will positively contribute to language teaching and learning, and it would open up new vistas for EFL teachers, syllabus designers, and academia.",TRUE,FALSE,correlation|critical thinking|Pakistani EFL teachers|teachers’ professional identity,2021-03-08T14:00:28.587794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:00:03.217979,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/citation/,4hucd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60459a9751a4a600ce77404d/,60459a9751a4a600ce77404d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4hucd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4hucd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4hucd,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.27

Almost all the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are using LMS to facilitate their teaching and learning processes. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LMS and the basic perception of students on the usage of LMS and various plugins to support their learning process not only to ensure its quality but also to evaluate different strategies for its future enhancement. Hence, this study adopts a developmental evaluation framework to assess students’ satisfaction and perception of using the (LMS) in their experiential Flipped Learning (FL) of English language modules. The methodology follows the pragmatic paradigm based on Dewey’s theory to allow for mixed-method instruments to be employed for a better understanding of the LMS, exploring its challenges and opportunities. This small-scale evaluative study involved a survey of 70 respondents and a focus group of ten students in a private HEI in Oman to explore their FL experience in English modules. The depiction of this experience represented positive responses emphasizing how FL technology-enhanced individualized/experiential learning reinforced in life-long learning skills suitable for career practice. Recommendations are offered for LMS to facilitate enhanced flipped teaching implementation, promoting a student-centered environment ideal for a broader approach of active learning in HEI contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Developmental evaluation|education technology|experiential learning|flipped learning|learning management system (LMS),2021-03-08T14:02:06.760422,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08T14:01:45.876041,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/citation/,xugvk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604599da6a10eb00b929fdec/,604599da6a10eb00b929fdec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xugvk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xugvk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xugvk,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.26
