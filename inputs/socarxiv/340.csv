Coupled with publication and related biases, this latitude raises the concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally select models that yield positive findings, leading to an unreliable body of published research. To combat this ""fishing"" problem in medical studies, leading journals now require preregistration of designs that emphasize the prior identification of dependent and independent variables. However, we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced specification, the scope for
fishing is considerable when there is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing field experiment for which we drafted a complete “mock report"" of findings using fake data on treatment assignment. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of this form of registration and propose that a comprehensive but non-binding approach be adopted as a first step to combat fishing by social scientists. Likely effects of comprehensive but non-binding registration are discussed, the principle advantage being communication rather than commitment, in particular that it generates a clear distinction between exploratory analyses and genuine tests.",TRUE,FALSE,Congo|Fishing|P-hacking|Pre Analysis Plan|Preregistration,2020-01-14T16:26:43.472355,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:18:59.289903,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/citation/,svu29,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d74e7855d4c012cb70f63/,5e1d74e7855d4c012cb70f63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svu29/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/svu29/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/svu29,https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mps021

We find little evidence that civic education improves registration. Local registration visits improve voter registration, a relationship that increases in poorer communities. Moreover, local registration increased electoral competition and vote preference diversity in down-ballot contests in the 2017 Kenyan elections.

This relationship is characterized by how cooperative or competitive states are with cities in their legislation. Despite the recent attention given to state preemption of local laws, this is not a new phenomenon. Part of the confusion surrounding preemption is that there is no shared definition or understanding of its forms. The purpose of this article is to begin to create that shared conception. In doing so, we define preemption according to its historic origins as the use of coercive methods to substitute state priorities for local policymaking. We argue modern state preemption of local laws can be divided into four phases, each with their own policies and mechanisms. We show how preemption has changed over time, shifting the functional, legal, and political relationship between states and their cities. Together, these phases help assist policymakers and administrators in understanding the nature of state preemption, and thus how to create and implement local policies in an environment where the distribution of power between governments is competitive and changing.",TRUE,FALSE,Intergovernmental relations|Local government autonomy|Preemption,2020-01-14T16:27:41.211331,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:22:17.227244,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/citation/,u2f4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1cfb33855d4c010fb71368/,5e1cfb33855d4c010fb71368,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2f4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2f4x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2f4x,NA

Despite their positive impact on economic welfare, concerns are raised about the negative association between social media usage and performance or well-being. However, causal empirical evidence is still scarce. To address this research gap, we conduct a randomized controlled trial among students in which we track participants’ digital activities over the course of three quarters of an academic year. In the experiment, we randomly allocate half of the sample to a treatment condition in which social media usage is restricted to a maximum of 10 minutes per day. We find that participants in the treatment group substitute social media for instant messaging and do not decrease their total time spent on digital devices. Contrary to findings from previous correlational studies, we do not find any impact of social media usage on well-being and academic success. Our results also suggest that antitrust authorities should consider instant messaging and social media services as direct competitors before approving acquisitions.",TRUE,FALSE,education|field experiment|performance|Social media|subjective well-being|welfare effects,2020-01-14T16:28:21.555090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:24:12.529079,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/citation/,udgxt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1cd0886822bd00f1fee117/,5e1cd0886822bd00f1fee117,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udgxt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udgxt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udgxt,NA

The ability to attract individuals is crucial for maintaining power and control over the territories in which these groups are settled. This study proposes the formalization, development and analysis of an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates a neighborhood of Palermo (Sicily) with the aim to understand the pathways that lead individuals to recruitment into organized crime groups (OCGs). Using empirical data on social, economic and criminal conditions of the area under analysis, we use a multi-layer network approach to simulate this scenario. As the final goal, we test different policies to counter recruitment into OCGs. These scenarios are based on two different dimensions of prevention and intervention: (i) primary and secondary socialization and (ii) law enforcement targeting strategies.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-based Modeling|Criminology|Law Enforcement|Mafias|Networks|Organized Crime|Policy|Socialization,2020-01-13T18:02:45.545578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-13T18:02:19.607118,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/citation/,egd4s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1c87a66822bd00c0fec70e/,5e1c87a66822bd00c0fec70e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/egd4s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/egd4s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/egd4s,NA
