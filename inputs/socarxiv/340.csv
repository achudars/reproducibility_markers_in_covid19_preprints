It makes responses challenging to compare intertemporally or interpersonally. This paper develops a formal model of the cognitive process that could give rise to scale norming in year on year responses to life satisfaction scale questions. It then uses this model to conceptually differentiate scale norming from adaptation and changes in reference points. Scale norming could make life satisfaction responses misleading with regards to the changing welfare of individuals. In particular, individuals who would say that their life is ""improving"" or ""going well"" might nonetheless give the same scale response year after year. This has major implications for the use of scales in cost-benefit analysis and other welfarist applications. While there is already substantial empirical evidence for the existence of scale norming, its implications for welfare analysis are sometimes understated on the grounds that this evidence might simply be the product of errors of memory. The paper presents new empirical evidence for scale norming from two surveys (N1 = 278; N2 = 1050) designed such that errors of memory are an unconvincing explanation for the results.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|Life Satisfaction|Measurement|Scale-Norming|Subjective Well-Being,2019-07-26T17:11:05.707372,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-26T17:10:33.974052,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Mark Otto Fabian,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/citation/,cg8n9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3b0292eb4caa001a9a792e/,5d3b0292eb4caa001a9a792e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cg8n9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cg8n9

This study identifies near repeat crime patterns in Dallas, Texas and examines the effects of an arrest on reducing the probability of future crime. 

Method: Using open source crime data from the Dallas Police Department from July 2014 through June 2018, we identified near repeat patterns for shootings, interpersonal robberies, residential burglaries, and thefts from motor vehicles. Logistic regression models were used to test the effect of an arrest on reducing near repeat crimes; controls for geographic, demographic, and temporal factors were included in each model. 

Results: Near repeat calculations suggest violent crime clustered closely in time and space, with property crime dispersed over larger spatial and temporal dimensions. Across all four crime types, findings suggest arrests resulted in 20% to 40% reductions in a near repeat follow up crime.

Conclusions: In line with past research on shootings, arrests reduced the likelihood of subsequent crimes. This suggests policing strategies to increase arrests may be a fruitful way to reduce near repeat crime patterns.

Paid parental benefits policies are explicitly aimed to encourage return-to-work and enhance infant health. However, some recent policies also aim to equalize housework and paid work within families by earmarking weeks of parental benefits for fathers that cannot be transferred to mothers. We examine two theoretical frameworks from sociology and economics to highlight potential mechanisms through which such policies may increase or decrease union dissolution, and why the direction and magnitude of the effects might differ across subpopulations. Then, using population-level administrative data, we examine how the Quebec Parental Insurance Program affected union dissolution. We find that overall, the policy decreased the divorce/separation rate by 0.6% points, a 7% reduction in the rate overall (intent-to-treat). Further, we find that the effect of fathers using parental benefits on the risk of divorce (treatment-on-treated) is more than double the intent-to-treat estimate. The policy had the greatest effects in reducing union dissolution among couples likely to be more egalitarian in orientation, and led to no increase in divorce, even in the most traditional couples.",TRUE,FALSE,divorce|family|gender equality|parental leave|policy,2019-07-25T18:59:22.210738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:59:04.997400,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Rachel Margolis|Youjin Choi|Anders Holm|Nirav Mehta,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/citation/,kqfd7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d39d366eb4caa0018999437/,5d39d366eb4caa0018999437,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kqfd7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kqfd7

Previously thought to be a sparsely occupied environment, archaeologists have recorded hundreds of geometric earthworks between the Purús and Acre rivers in recent years, spurring renewed interest in understanding the distribution, age, and function of these structures. A challenge has been to identify possible relationships between sites and to place them in their broader landscape setting. The precise spatial scale, relative importance of different factors, and strength of any relationships that contributed to shaping their distributions remain an open question. This paper develops and applies an explicitly spatial framework to address this problem, drawing on a rich body of recent research in Acre state (Brazil) and advanced point process modelling. The analytical approach, which is fully documented and reproducible with the accompanying code, infers the factors affecting earthwork distribution at multiple spatial scales. This enables the first robust predictions of territorial integration in the region, which is discussed context of extant archaeological models.

In 2014, the Chinese government proposed to build a social credit system (SCS) to better collect and evaluate citizens’ creditworthiness and grant rewards and punishments based on one’s social credit. Since then, various SCS pilots have been enacted. While current media and scholars often perceive SCS as a single and unified system, this paper argues that there are in fact multiple SCSs in China. I identify four main types of SCS and articulate the relationships among them. Each SCS has different assumptions, operationalizations, and implementations. China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, and the macroeconomic management agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, are the two most important actors in the design and implementation of the multiple SCSs. Yet their distinctive views about what “credit” is and what an SCS should be produced great tensions on the SCS landscape. I also historicize current SCSs and show that many elements and assumptions of SCSs can be traced back to a broader political history of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Finally, I propose an alternative theoretical framework to understand Chinese SCSs as a symbolic system with performative power that is more than a simple repressive and direct political project.",TRUE,FALSE,China|Classification|Governance|Rating System|Social Credit System,2019-07-25T10:12:49.648671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T10:12:02.111878,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",Chuncheng Liu,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/citation/,v9frs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/79qn2/,79qn2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d38d6db5d2cdc00180773c5/,5d38d6db5d2cdc00180773c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9frs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9frs

What was left unaddressed was the deep and long-standing enmeshment of the Libyan and Egyptian economies, embodied in the tens of thousands of Egyptian workers who remain in Libya despite the civil war raging there. There is a history of maltreatment of Egyptian migrants in Libya spanning more than 60 years. The abuses date back to the organized migration of Egyptian teachers, bureaucrats and other professionals under Gamal Abdel Nasser, and have continued with increasing brutality until the present. From the beginning, whether under King Idris, under Muammar al-Qaddafi or following the colonel’s downfall, the causes of the violence have been distinctly political, with Egyptians in Libya always vulnerable to the vicissitudes of Egyptian-Libyan state relations as well as to regional crises. The welfare of these workers has always been subordinate to strategic concerns in the calculations of both states.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab world|Egyptian migration|Gaddafi|Immigration to Libya|Labor migration|Libya|Middle East|North African politics,2019-07-28T12:06:05.364760,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-28T12:05:46.181401,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/citation/,5qex2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xgc5e/,xgc5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3872f25d2cdc0019081ff6/,5d3872f25d2cdc0019081ff6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qex2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5qex2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5qex2

Associate member groups offered congregations a new way to extend the reach of their respective missions and charisms, while deepening the relationships with lay women and men who partnered with them in ministry.

In this paper, I explore the relatively recent history of associate groups and how these organizations have and continue to work with their sponsoring congregations. I use data from the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA)—commissioned recently by the North American Conference of Associates and Religious (NACAR)—to look at demographic trends among women religious and associates. I describe how religious communities incorporate associates into their organizational decision-making, and how certain internal processes—like general chapters—are now open to associate members.

Overall, I submit that given the declining numbers of sisters and aging populations of many religious communities, associate groups have the potential to provide opportunities to conceptualize new forms of religious life in the Catholic Church. Finally, I argue that associate groups also have the important role of increasing gender, racial, and class diversity among communities of women religious, and that this diversity may lead to a more inclusive and democratizing corporate structure for women’s religious congregations in the 21st century.",TRUE,FALSE,Clergy|Gender|Nuns|Religiosity|Religious Life|Sociology of Religion|Spirituality|Women Religious,2019-07-25T10:03:21.904044,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T10:03:05.110281,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/citation/,we627,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d385f09a667db001afa2f0b/,5d385f09a667db001afa2f0b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/we627/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/we627

The citizens have not chosen a simple switch on the power, but contributed with their votes to a strategic defeat of populism and in same time they paved the way for the search of a new type of leadership, which is close to realism in handling with social problems that can't be implemented with calculated financial costs. The vote of 7 th Juli is  a vote against the over-promising and under-delivery experienced under Syriza’s rule. The voting for conservative ND is not an ideological choice. It's a choice that runs counter to the logic of falsely or hypocritical negotiating austerity measures opposed to Greece buy his Lenders (memorandum) and the consequent tax-tornado as a result of negotiating failure with the partners in the EEC and the IMF. The positive vote for ND also reflects the contradiction with the misguided manipulations of public opinion regarding the Skopje-Question and finally the strategy of micro concessions and micro- allowances as a means of concluding a “political-social alliance” with an undefined hostile establishment.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-24T13:20:08.003609,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T12:26:46.017480,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/citation/,35js7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d383c575d2cdc001907f9d3/,5d383c575d2cdc001907f9d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35js7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/35js7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/35js7
