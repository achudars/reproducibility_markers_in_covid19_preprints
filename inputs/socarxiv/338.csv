misrepresentation by presenting preliminary results from a crowdsourced survey. Data from the
2016 European Union (EU) referendum at Local Authority level in England is visualised using
four alternative methods (balanced cartogram, hexogram, hexagonal grid, square grid) and
compared to a traditional choropleth map, in terms of people’s understanding of the authors’

He urged his disciples (those he had already made his followers) as he was about leaving the world to go into the world and make disciples of all nations, ordering them to ""Baptize them, In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"" ( Matt 28:19).  This admonition coupled with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, vivified the disciples in their missionary enterprise to the extent that Christianity embraced various nations with their various cultures and natural inclinations.  In Acts 15:1-35 the meeting of different cultures brought about controversy which nearly rocked the Gentile mission and indeed the entire missionary enterprise.  Peaceful  resolution of the misunderstanding brought about proper definition of what Christianity is all about (which is salvation by faith in Jesus Christ) and subsequent universal development of the church.  It was as a result of the harmonious resolution of that controversy that made both the Jews and Gentles to feel welcomed in the one family of Christ hence the innumerable number of Christians today. In our society today, integrated development is hindered because of various unresolved controversies.  This article aims at identifying the reason why there is no integral development in very many societies and organizations and proffering solution to that effect. It argues that if the leaders of various organizations and societies were to understand properly the actions of the apostles, elders and the church  in Acts 15:1-35 and imbibe it, then integral development would be assured.

And, from an epidemiological vantage there is substantive research examining how social traits of neighbourhoods affect health. However, this research has often focused on the effects of social deprivation. Less attention has been given to social fragmentation (SF), a construct aligned with the notions of lesser: social cohesion, social capital, collective functioning, and social isolation. Concurrently, there has been limited research that has described the spatial and temporal patterning of neighbourhood-level social traits. With a focus on SF the main aims of this paper were to model and describe the time-varying and spatial nature of SF.
Conceptually, this research was informed by ‘thinking in time’ and by the ‘lifecourse-of-place’ perspective. While, from an analytical perspective, a longitudinal (3-time points over 10-years) neighbourhood database was created for the metropolitan region of Adelaide, Australia. Latent Transition Analysis was then used to model the developmental profile of SF where neighbourhoods were proxied by ‘suburbs’, and the measurement model for SF was formed of 9-conceptually related census-based indicators. A four-class, nominal-level latent status model of SF was identified: class-A=low SF; class-B=mixed-level SF/inner urban; class-C=mixed-level SF/peri-urban; and class-D=high SF. Class-A and -D neighbourhoods were the most prevalent at all time points. And, while certain neighbourhoods were inferred to have changed their SF class across time, most neighbourhoods were characterised by intransience.",TRUE,FALSE,Latent transition model|Latent variables|Longitudinal|Neighborhoods|Social environment|Urban change,2019-07-31T20:59:06.866593,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T20:58:37.865500,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/citation/,56x9c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p3kgf/,p3kgf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d41efe63ce935001aec0bf8/,5d41efe63ce935001aec0bf8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/56x9c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/56x9c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/56x9c,NA

Meanwhile, parallel concerns about surveillance practices have already led to multiple successful regulatory efforts of surveillance technologies—many of which have algorithmic components. Here, we examine municipal surveillance regulation as offering lessons for algorithmic oversight. Taking the 2017 Seattle Surveillance Ordinance as our primary case study and surveying efforts across five other cities, we describe the features of existing surveillance regulation; including procedures for describing surveillance technologies in detail, processes for public engagement, and processes for establishing acceptable uses. Although these surveillance-focused laws were not intended to address algorithmic accountability, we find these considerations to be relevant to the law’s aim of surfacing disparate impacts of systems in use. We also find that in notable cases, government employees did not identify regulated algorithmic surveillance technologies as reliant on algorithmic or machine learning systems, highlighting a definitional gap that could hinder future efforts toward algorithmic regulation. We argue that (i) finer-grained distinctions between types of analytic and information systems in the language of law and policy, and (ii) risk assessment tools integrated into their implementation would both strengthen future regulatory efforts by rendering underlying algorithmic components more legible and accountable to political and community stakeholders.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-31T21:00:20.880820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T20:59:57.907488,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",Meg Young|Michael Katell|P.

Prior literature highlights the importance of environmental conditions, economic defensibility, and wealth transmission for shaping early Holocene origins of social inequality. However, it remains untested whether the mechanisms that drive the evolution of inequality in recent human societies follow a similar trajectory. We conduct the first global analysis of pathways to inequality within modern human societies using structural equation modeling. Our analytical approach demonstrates that environmental conditions, resource intensification, and wealth transmission mechanisms impact various forms of social inequality via a complex web of causality. We further find that subsistence practices have a direct impact on some institutionalized forms of inequality.

Most of the descriptive work on data fraud is concerned with diagnosing the causes of fraudulent and deceptive research practices or with measuring their extent, while on the normative side, most calls for reform in academic publishing rely largely on more rigorous data policies and renewed calls for observational awareness. Alas, it remains to be seen whether such methods of self-regulation will be effective at reducing the incidence of research fraud. This paper thus proposes a different approach to data fraud, one that is more likely to reduce the incidence of data fabrication. Specifically, I propose that alleged serial academic fraudsters like James Hunton be charged with criminal wire fraud.

I argue that rural natural resource dependence represents a special case of the core periphery relationship, where rural, resource rich labor markets form a dual dependency on both the global capitalist economy and the local natural environment. This occurs because the contradiction between spatially fixed natural resources and the mobility of capital prompts both external interests and local power elites to use their power to pressure rural labor markets in directions outside their best interest and to exploit rural labor. I argue that both extractive (e.g. mining, timber, agriculture) and non extractive (e. tourism, real estate) forms of natural resource development share this contradiction.

These changes impact on the management and regulation of future energy systems and question how they will support a socially equitable, acceptable, net-zero transition. This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies, business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and optimisation (e.g. automated network management), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways. Through this they are expected to deliver on a wide range of outcomes, both within the SLES boundary and to the wider system. However, there may be trade-offs between outcomes due to pressures for change originating from competing actors (e.g. landscape vs. incumbents in the regime); understanding the mapping between different outcomes, SLES elements and their interconnections will be key to unlocking wider benefits.",TRUE,FALSE,Community energy|Decentralized energy|Energy democratization|Energy transition|Expert interviews|Meta-narrative review|Smart cities|Smart local energy systems,2019-07-31T21:00:41.857373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T21:00:28.169661,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/citation/,j4d57,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/82dnf/,82dnf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d419d233ce9350019ec2a00/,5d419d233ce9350019ec2a00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4d57/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j4d57/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j4d57,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120612

Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without ""ground truth"" information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National Information Service's (NIS) disinformation campaign during the presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of campaign accounts published in court proceedings. Features that best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory.",TRUE,FALSE,Astroturfing|Disinformation|Election campaign|Propaganda|Social media,2019-07-31T12:21:23.411277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T12:20:57.049881,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/citation/,a5gk6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpa6u/,tpa6u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3f6a3f596eee001d653479/,5d3f6a3f596eee001d653479,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a5gk6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a5gk6,NA
