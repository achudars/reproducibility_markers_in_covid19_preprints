5z4hv,preprints,2016-08-24T21:53:03.052000,2018-07-02T10:46:26.490393,2016-08-24T21:53:03.052000,NA,NA,Scope,"Intellectual property (IP) law doctrines fall into three basic categories:
validity, infringement and defenses. Virtually every significant legal
doctrine in IP is either about whether the plaintiff has a valid IP right
that the law will recognize – validity – about whether what the defendant
did violates that right – infringement – or about whether the defendant is
somehow privileged to violate that right-defenses.

IP regimes tend to enforce a more or less strict separation between these
three legal doctrines. They apply different burdens of proof and persuasion
to infringement and validity. In many cases they ask different actors to
decide one doctrine but not the other. The U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, for example, decides questions of patent and trademark validity but
not questions of infringement. Even in court, resolution of one issue is
often allocated to a judge while the jury decides a different issue. And
even where none of that is true, the nature of IP law is to categorize an
argument in order to apply the proper rules for that argument.

The result of this separation is that parties treat IP rights “like a nose
of wax, which may be turned and twisted in any direction.” When
infringement is at issue, IP owners tout the breadth of their rights, while
accused infringers seek to cabin them within narrow bounds. When it comes
to validity, however, the parties reverse their position, with IP owners
emphasizing the narrowness of their rights in order to avoid having those
rights held invalid and accused infringers arguing the reverse.

Because of the separation between validity, infringement, and defenses, it
is often possible for a party to successfully argue that an IP right means
one thing in one context and something very different in another. And
courts won’t necessarily detect the problem because they are thinking of
only the precise legal issue before them.

The result is a number of IP doctrines that simply make no sense to an
outsider. In patent law, for instance, it is accepted law that there is no
“practicing the prior art” defense. In other words, one can be held liable
for doing precisely what others had legally done before, even though a
patent isn’t supposed to cover things people have already done. In design
patent law, one can be held liable for making a design that an “ordinary
observer” would find too similar to a patented design, even though the
things that make the two look similar – say, the roundness of the wheels on
my car – are not things the patentee is entitled to own. In copyright, once
a court has concluded that someone has actually copied from the plaintiff,
a song will sometimes be deemed infringing because of its similarity to a
prior song, even if the similarity is overwhelmingly attributable to
unprotectable standard components of the genre. And in trademark, a party
can be deemed infringing because its products look to similar to the
plaintiffs’ mark and therefore make confusion likely, even if that
confusion is likely caused by non-source-designating features of the design.

The culprit is simple, but fundamental: IP regimes largely lack an
integrated procedure for deciding the proper extent of an IP right. The
proper scope of an IP right is not a matter of natural right or immutable
definition. Rather, it is a function of the purposes of the IP regime. But
without some way of assessing how broad an IP right is that considers
validity, infringement, and defenses together, courts will always be prone
to make mistakes in applying any one of the doctrines.

In this article, we suggest that IP regimes need a process for determining
the scope of an IP right. Scope is not merely validity, and it is not
merely infringement. Rather, it is the range of things the IP right
lawfully protects against competition. IP rights that claim too broad a
scope tend to be invalid, either because they tread on the rights of those
who came before or because they cover things that the law has made a
decision not to allow anyone to own. IP rights with narrower scope are
valid, but the narrowness of that scope should be reflected in the
determination of what actions do and do not infringe that right. And
whatever the doctrinal label, we should not allow an IP owner to capture
something that is not within the legitimate scope of her right. Nor should
it follow from the fact that some uses are outside the lawful scope of an
IP owner’s right that the IP right itself is invalid and cannot be asserted
against anyone. Only by evaluating scope in a single, integrated proceeding
can courts avoid the nose of wax problem that has grown endemic in IP law.
Scope is, quite simply, the fundamental question that underlies everything
else in IP law, but which courts rarely think about expressly.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:26.482183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:53:03.052000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/citation/,5z4hv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hafzz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/relationships/node/,hafzz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be17479ad5a1020968da2c/,57be17479ad5a1020968da2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5z4hv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5z4hv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5z4hv

suggest that this diversity of legal rules is largely traceable to
differences in the audience in IP cases. Patent, trademark, copyright, and
design patent each focus on a different person as the fulcrum for
evaluating IP infringement. The fact that patent law focuses on an expert
audience while trademark looks to a consumer audience explains many of the
differences in how patent and trademark cases are decided. Expert audiences
are likely to evaluate infringement based on the technical similarity
between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s works. Consumers, by contrast, are
likely to pay more attention to market substitution and less attention to
how things work under the hood. Understanding the different audiences in IP
infringement is critical to understanding how the IP regimes define
infringement.

The focus on audience has normative as well as descriptive implications.
Neither patent law, with its focus on experts and technical similarity, nor
trademark law, with its market-based consumer focus, has it entirely
correct. Rather, we suggest that as a general matter infringement of an IP
right should require both technical similarity and market substitution.
Assessing infringement through the expert’s eyes ensures that the law
prevents closely related works in the field while allowing later
contributions to the field that are sufficiently different. The consumer
vantage point ensures that we protect IP owners only when they have been
harmed in the marketplace.

IP owners who want to show infringement should have to show both that the
defendant’s work is technically similar to their own from the expert’s
vantage point and that the defendant’s use causes the plaintiff market
harm. Copyright law, which does look both to experts and to consumers at
various points in infringement analysis, is on the right track.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:34.034676,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:51:23.365000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/citation/,dxpt7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4q6ca/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/relationships/node/,4q6ca,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be16dcb83f6901f26564ec/,57be16dcb83f6901f26564ec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxpt7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dxpt7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dxpt7

promote overall efficiency in the economy.

While the search costs theory provides a compelling argument for trademark
rights, it also compels an equally important - but often overlooked - set
of principles for defining and limiting those rights. Certainly, trademark
laws can make it easier and cheaper for consumers to locate products with
desired qualities, thus making markets more competitive. Yet if carried too
far, trademark law can do the opposite: it can entrench market dominance by
leading firms and make it harder for competitors to crack new markets. The
evolution of trademark law reflects a continual balancing act that seeks to
maximize the informational value of marks while avoiding their use to
suppress competitive information.

Most of the literature on the search costs theory of trademark law has
focused on the theory as a rationale for trademark protection. In this
article, we examine its role in supporting trademark defenses. We find that
some trademark defenses unambiguously lower consumer search costs and thus
promote the goals of trademark law. Another group of defenses, however,
involves behavior that increases consumer search costs for some individuals
even as it improves economic conditions for others. We believe that these
latter defenses - genericness, functionality, and abandonment - may
sometimes go too far in accepting increased consumer search costs as the
cost of achieving competition. Rather than the all-or-nothing approach
suggested by these doctrines, we suggest that consumers would benefit from
a more nuanced approach in these doctrines.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:30.809539,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:48:41.969000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/citation/,8qs4y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3j7fz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/relationships/node/,3j7fz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be163b594d9001ffd0e398/,57be163b594d9001ffd0e398,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qs4y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8qs4y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8qs4y

that has arguably had the most significant impact on claim construction is
the doctrine of claim differentiation. The claim differentiation doctrine
in its broadest reading provides that no two claims in the same patent
should be interpreted to cover the same thing.

As a general matter, applying the doctrine of claim differentiation results
in broader constructions of patent claims, because it is most commonly used
to prevent defendants from limiting a broad genus claim to the range of
embodiments actually disclosed or more explicitly recited in other claims.
Sometimes this is the right result, because defendants are improperly
seeking to limit broader genus claims to the preferred embodiments
disclosed in the specification. But at other times it leads to problematic
results.

years ago jury trials in patent cases were quite rare. There is,
surprisingly, no precedential decision resolving the Seventh Amendment
question. And English practice before 1791 -- the basis for Seventh
Amendment jurisprudence -- is ambiguous at best on whether juries must
decide patent validity. I argue that if and when the issue is presented to
the Supreme Court, the Court is unlikely to find a constitutional right to
jury trial on issues of patent validity, and certainly not the broad right
of the sort that is now common practice. Removing the jury from most patent

the first person to invent something, rather than the first to file a
patent application. In order to determine who is first to invent, the
United States has created an elaborate set of ""interference"" proceedings
and legal standards to define invention and decide how it may be proven.
Supporters of this system claim that it is necessary to protect small
inventors, who may not have the resources to file patent applications
quickly, and may therefore lose a patent race to large companies who
invented after they did. Advocates of global patent harmonization have
suggested, however, that the first inventor is usually also the first to
file, and that the first-to-invent standard is unnecessary and wasteful.

In this Article, we study U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (""PTO"")
interference proceedings and court cases in which the parties dispute who
is first to invent. We find that the first person to file is usually, but
by no means always, also the first to invent. In over 40% of the cases, the
first to invent is last to file. We also find that the long-standing rule
that discriminated against foreign inventors by requiring proof of
inventive activity in the U.S. had surprisingly little effect on outcomes;
that a large number of priority disputes involve near-simultaneous
invention; and that the vast majority of such disputes could be resolved
without reliance on much of the evidence the law permits. Finally, we study
the role of small inventors to see whether they are disproportionately the
beneficiaries of the first to invent system. While the evidence is mixed,
it does not appear that small inventors particularly benefit from the first
to invent system.

Part I describes the legal background for the international debate over how
to determine patent priority. Part II describes our studies and discusses
our results in detail. Finally, Part III draws conclusions for
policy-makers from the data. There is some truth to the arguments of both
sides in this debate. The first to invent system does produce significantly
different results in individual cases than a first to file system would.
But it is not clear that those different results are particularly fairer,
or that they are worth the cost. We suggest some possible ways to modify
the U.S. system to take account of these facts without changing entirely to
a first-to-file system.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:45.138927,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:38:41.552000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/citation/,vgq78,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/794ej/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/relationships/node/,794ej,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be13e39ad5a101fb68d994/,57be13e39ad5a101fb68d994,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgq78/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vgq78/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vgq78

unless they practice the complete invention. Nonetheless, patent courts
have long recognized that focusing only on the party who actually practices
the invention will sometimes let off the hook the party who most deserves
to be held liable. Thus, for over a century patent courts have extended
liability to one who does not himself infringe, but who actively induces
infringement by another. Since 1952, this principle has been enshrined in
section 271(b) of the patent statute. As an idea, it has proven
uncontroversial.

Surprisingly, however, despite the venerable nature of inducement in patent
law, the actual content of the inducement requirement has remained
something of a mystery. In particular, courts have proven unable to decide
two fundamental issues - what it means actually to induce infringement, and
what the inducer must know and intend in order to be liable for acting.
Though the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
was created in 1982, now handles all patent appeals, it has not brought
uniformity to either issue. Indeed, there are Federal Circuit opinions
taking diametrically opposed positions on the law of inducement. This
confusion is doubly unfortunate given that the Supreme Court has recently
imported the law of inducement from patent into copyright law. Before we
adopt the concept of inducement in copyright cases, it would seem helpful
to know what exactly it means in patent cases.

In this article, I set out the fundamental disagreements among the courts
as to the conduct and intent prongs of inducement. I explore the policies
behind inducement law, and suggest that these disagreements can best be
resolved not by picking one side or the other, but by thinking of
inducement as a sliding scale inquiry in which a more specific intent to
infringe is required to find liability if the defendant's conduct is
otherwise less egregious. This resolution not only makes policy sense, and
integrates section 271(b) with the rest of the statute, but it may even
have the virtue of explaining most of the apparently conflicting caselaw.
Application of this sliding scale approach also has implications for
secondary liability in copyright law.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:31.686574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:28:40.252000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/citation/,7guw6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/634qf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/relationships/node/,634qf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be11896c613b01ead93923/,57be11896c613b01ead93923,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7guw6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7guw6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7guw6
