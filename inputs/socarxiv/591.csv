It also aims to see how their held beliefs influence their teaching practices. To fulfil this purpose, four English lecturers teaching communicative English subject, contextualized in one polytechnic in Malaysia, were purposively selected as participants of the study. The data were gathered through interviews, non-participant classroom observation, as well as collection of relevant documents. The Atlas t.i. program was used to manage the data and thematic analysis was applied in data analysis. Generally, the findings indicate that the participants viewed the knowledge about spoken form as a relevant exposure to students, but it should not be the focal attention of the lesson. They also believed that interactional skills could be acquired through frequent speaking practices, and these beliefs are consistent with their teaching practices. The data also revealed some misconceptions about certain concepts in spoken language, and the teaching of the components in focus is found to be limited. This indicates a lack of depth content knowledge among the lecturers in these specific areas, hence recommendations for appropriate trainings and professional development programs are made to facilitate teachers to be more well-informed with their pedagogical decisions in classroom. In conclusion, this study illuminates the salient role of content knowledge among practicing teachers, as it potentially affects their teaching practices.",TRUE,FALSE,interactional skills|spoken forms|spoken language teaching|teachers’ beliefs,2018-07-02T11:15:53.442135,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-15T21:42:58.534135,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/citation/,ejthq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hc6gr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/relationships/node/,hc6gr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3d58c6c613b02c6cf8a4b/,59e3d58c6c613b02c6cf8a4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejthq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ejthq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ejthq

One response to this academic quandary is, as the research suggests, that attachment to the caregiver is a vital platform for all child development and learning Bowlby (1958).  Another proposition is that attachment theory premises can be used to identify if and how attachment to a parent impacts attachment to literature and literacy development, which directly affects academic achievement. The association between attachment to the caregiver and a child’s attachment to literature among Anglo-Germanic groups (Van Ijzendoorn, 1996) has been studied, and the results demonstrate a direct correlation between the rapport with the caregiver and literacy acquisition and reading readiness.

Some scholars believe that presupposition is purely semantic and others believe that it is purely pragmatic. The present paper contributes to the ongoing debate and exposes the different ways presupposition was approached by linguists. The paper also tries to attend to (i) what semantics is and what pragmatics is in a unified theory of meaning and (ii) the possibility to outline a semantic account of presupposition without having recourse to pragmatics and vice versa. The paper advocates Gazdar’s analysis, a pragmatic analysis, as the safest grounds on which a working grammar of presupposition could be outlined. It shows how semantic accounts are inadequate to deal with the projection problem.

In this line, a mixed qualitative quantitative approach was conducted over a period of fifteen weeks on sixty English major students enrolled in their first year at the Lebanese University, fifth branch. The sixty participants were divided into two groups (30 experimental) that benefited from instruction on exophoric and endophoric relations and (30 control) that did not have the opportunity to study referents in the designated period of the research. The participants sat for a reading and writing pretest at the beginning of the study; and they sat again for the same reading and writing assessment at the end of the study. The results of the pre and post tests for both groups were analyzed via SPSS program and findings were as follows: hypothesis one stating that students who are aware of endophoric and exophoric relations are likely to achieve better results in decoding a text than are their peers who receive no referential instruction, was accepted with significant findings.  Hypothesis two stating that students who are aware of endophoric and exophoric relations are likely to perform better in writing than their peers who receive no referential instruction , was accepted with significant findings. Hypothesis three stating that, students who learn endophoric exophoric relations become aware of referents and their linguistic function, was also asserted with significant findings.

The aim is to reach at an explanation as to why Iraqi does not use a copula while English does. Explanation of this sort is significant because it has some direct implications on English language teaching and translation in Iraq. Using inductive method of reasoning, it has been established that tracing grammatical properties such as tense and agreement may lead to find-out the reason behind this cross-linguistic variation and subsequently reach at a generalization that maybe applicable to other languages. The latter is an issue that remains open for further research.

Indeed, this is the current situation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with English encroaching into all areas of society, and especially forcefully into the education sector, where English as a medium of instruction (EMI) is on the rise. At the same time, Arabic literacy, the ability to read and write in the language, is declining among UAE youth. Using a mixed-methods design, a study was conducted to gain insights into the use of Arabic by Emirati university students. The study examines how Emirati youth use their native language (i.e., Arabic) in their daily lives, their perception of their own reading and writing skills in Arabic vis-à-vis in English language, and the extent to which they can demonstrate their literacy skills in Arabic. Clear evidence emerged showing that while Arabic as a dialect continues to be spoken and used on a daily basis, Arabic literacy is unquestionably losing ground. This paper concludes with a call for a language policy in the UAE that will give Arabic its due in schools and wider society.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic literacy|bilingualism|global English|language policy|medium of instruction|United Arab Emirates,2018-07-02T11:15:53.072526,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-15T21:17:55.933209,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/citation/,ya3hs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ywmh5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/relationships/node/,ywmh5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3be356c613b02c5cf47fc/,59e3be356c613b02c5cf47fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya3hs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ya3hs/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ya3hs

Organization takes three forms: inclusion, regulation, and distinction. Overorganization is an increase in an organization’s size (overinclusion), regulatory activity (overregulation), or subculture (overdistinction). Underorganization is a contraction in size (underinclusion), regulatory activity (underregulation), or subculture (underdistinction). Numerous examples show how conflict is a direct function of the movement of organizational time.
