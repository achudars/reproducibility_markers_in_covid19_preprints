We show that opposition to stricter gun control is closely linked to Christian nationalism, a religious cultural framework that mandates a symbiotic relationship between Christianity and civil society. Using data from a national population-based survey, we show that Christian nationalism is an exceptionally strong predictor of opposition to the federal government enacting stricter gun laws. In fact, of all the variables we considered only general political orientation has more predictive power than Christian nationalism. We propose that the gun control debate is complicated by deeply held moral and religious schemas that discussions focused solely on rational public safety calculations do not sufficiently address. For the substantial proportion of American society who are Christian nationalists, gun rights are God-given and sacred. Consequently, attempts to reform existing gun laws must attend to the deeper cultural and religious identities that undergird Americans’ beliefs about gun control.",TRUE,FALSE,Christian nationalism|gun control|guns|religion|United States,2018-07-02T11:53:09.931580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-18T17:57:49.952370,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/citation/,3ag7k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/geuzq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/relationships/node/,geuzq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aff045d365b68000f571725/,5aff045d365b68000f571725,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ag7k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3ag7k/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023118790189,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3ag7k

But culture does not spread like a virus. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation which we refer to as associative diffusion. Drawing on two insights from research in cognition—that meaning inheres in cognitive associations between concepts, and that such perceived associations constrain people’s actions—we propose a model wherein, rather than beliefs or behaviors per-se, the things being transmitted between individuals are perceptions about what beliefs or behaviors are compatible with one another. Conventional contagion models require an assumption of network segregation to explain cultural variation. In contrast, we demonstrate that the endogenous emergence of cultural differentiation can be entirely attributable to social cognition and does not necessitate a clustered social network or a preexisting
division into groups. Moreover, we show that prevailing assumptions about the effects of network topology do not hold when diffusion is associative.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural differentiation|cultural evolution|culture|diffusion|polarization|social contagion|social networks,2018-07-02T11:53:09.359814,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-18T10:44:49.704458,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/citation/,uqvd3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5ke7n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/relationships/node/,5ke7n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afe57b9d1a5a0000dfae85e/,5afe57b9d1a5a0000dfae85e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvd3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uqvd3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uqvd3

In 2015, voters in Seattle approved the creation of the Democracy Voucher program with the intent of broadening representation in the campaign finance system and expanding participation from marginalized communities. Every registered voter in Seattle was provided with four, twenty-five-dollar vouchers that they could, in turn, assign to the local candidate(s) of their choice.  Through an analysis of the inaugural implementation of the program in 2017, we investigate whether this innovative public financing system increased participation, broadened involvement from underrepresented groups and led to a donor pool that was more representative of the electorate. Compared to cash donors in the municipal election, we report that voucher users are less likely to be high-income and more likely to come from poor neighborhoods.  While older residents are over-represented among voucher users, there is little difference in the racial composition of cash donors and voucher users.  Our analysis confirms that the Democracy Voucher program successfully moved the donor pool in a more egalitarian direction, although it remains demographically unrepresentative of the electorate.  The lessons from Seattle’s inaugural implementation offer key insights for other municipalities considering public financing policies, and these lessons have the potential to reshape the national policy debate about the influence of political money.",TRUE,FALSE,Campaign Donors|Campaign Finance|Democracy Vouchers|Money in Politics|Political Participation|Seattle,2018-07-02T11:53:07.786850,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-16T23:53:53.122830,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs",Brian J.

Whereas nudges rely on manipulation of choice architecture to steer people towards better choices, the objective of boosts is to develop good decision-making competences. Proponents of both approaches claim capacity to enhance social welfare through better individual decisions. We suggest that such efforts should involve a more careful analysis of how individual and social welfare are related in the policy context. First, individual rationality is not always sufficient or necessary for improving collective outcomes. Second, collective outcomes of complex social interactions among individuals are largely ignored by the focus of both nudge and boost on individual decisions.

Prior work has shown that between 1990 and 2000, the religiously unafﬁliated population also became more religious in belief and practices, both in absolute terms and relative to the afﬁliated population. This curious empirical ﬁnding is believed to be driven by a dilution effect in which moderate believers disafﬁliated from organized religion without giving up religious beliefs and practices. In the current article, I use data from the General Social Survey to show that this convergence of beliefs and practices of the religiously afﬁliated and unafﬁliated ended around 2000. Since 2000, the religiously unafﬁliated have decreased their belief in god and the afterlife, and have not increased their prayer frequency. The trends for the afﬁliated have been either increasing or unchanging and thus the religious practices and beliefs of the religiously afﬁliated and unafﬁliated have diverged since 2000. The change in trend for the religiously unafﬁliated after 2000 cannot fully be explained generational succession or the growing percentage of Americans raised without religion. Although the unafﬁliated remain very heterogeneous in their beliefs and practices, these results point to a growing religious polarization in the United States.",TRUE,FALSE,nones|polarization|religious change,2018-07-02T11:53:04.635753,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T21:09:46.997527,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/citation/,ae97g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/94kv6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/relationships/node/,94kv6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afb3d9713c138000e048f28/,5afb3d9713c138000e048f28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ae97g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ae97g/,https://doi.org/10.15195/v5.a16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ae97g

Thus, moving between positions should give significant rewards to workers. This assumption is often overlooked and doesn’t sit well with today’s precarious markets. I ask “what do workers get from mobility?” Drawing from the British Household Panel Survey (2000-2008) I test mobility’s effects on subjective and objective outcomes. Results do not support that mobility, in itself, leads to overall better jobs. Rather, internal change contains premiums beyond the characteristics of workers, while external change leads to subjective premiums alone.",TRUE,FALSE,career ladders|earnings|job mobility|panel analysis,2018-07-02T11:53:03.795448,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-15T16:01:47.469187,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Working paper,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/citation/,wvtk7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3y758/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/relationships/node/,3y758,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5afae60413c138000d039bc4/,5afae60413c138000d039bc4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wvtk7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wvtk7/,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJM-08-2018-0263,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wvtk7
