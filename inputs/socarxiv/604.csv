Previous work suggested that the relationship is due to education socializing students to the “official culture” of the United States. This study uses the World Values Survey and General Social Survey to further develop this theory and test whether it applies to Americans’ attitudes toward justifiable violence. I find that Americans with more education are less likely to say that interpersonal violence—against women, children, and other individuals—can be justifiable. However, they are more likely to say that state-sanctioned violence—war and police violence—can be justifiable. These patterns are consistent with a modified socialization model of education and social attitudes. I conclude that American education socializes people to establishment culture, identity, and interests, which differentiate between unacceptable interpersonal violence and ostensibly acceptable state-sanctioned violence.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes|Corporal Punishment|Education|Family Violence|Interpersonal Violence|Intimate Partner Violence|Police Brutality|Violence|War,2018-07-02T11:09:32.385729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-30T18:57:16.829549,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/citation/,hgjsr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8hzbm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/relationships/node/,8hzbm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a709fc9ad5a10256d7aa48/,59a709fc9ad5a10256d7aa48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hgjsr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hgjsr,NA

The vulnerability of coastal populations exposed to inundation will be greater for some sub-populations due to differences in their socio-demographic characteristics. Many climate risk and vulnerability assessments, however, model current populations against future environments. We advance sea-level rise risk assessments by dynamically modeling environmental change and socio-demographic change. We project three scenarios of inundation exposure due to future sea-level rise in coastal Georgia from 2010 to 2050. We align the sea-level rise projections with five population projection scenarios of socially vulnerable sub-populations via the Hamilton-Perry method and the theory of demographic metabolism. Our combined fast sea-level rise and middle population scenarios project a near doubling of the population exposed, and a more than five-fold increase for those at risk (i.e., residing in a census tract with high social vulnerability) and most at risk (i.e., high social vulnerability and high exposure) compared to the same estimate based on 2010 population data. Of vulnerable sub-populations, women had the largest absolute increase in exposure for all scenario combinations. The Hispanic/Latinx population’s exposure increased the largest proportionally under the fast and medium sea-level rise projections and elderly people’s (65+) under the slow sea-level rise scenario. Our findings suggest that for coastal areas experiencing rapid growth (or declines) in more socially vulnerable sub-populations, estimates based on current population data are likely to underestimate (or overestimate) the proportion of such groups’ risk to inundation from future sea-level rise.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|demographic metabolism|Georgia|risk assessment|sea-level rise|social vulnerability,2018-07-02T11:09:30.699070,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-29T20:13:54.723908,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/citation/,pkr75,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hw6yv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/relationships/node/,hw6yv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a5c9d66c613b0258258325/,59a5c9d66c613b0258258325,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pkr75/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pkr75,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.12.019

The issue of slowdown now accounts for a largely unquestioned measure, expected to deliver unhasty tempo conditioning good and ethical life, mental well-being and accountable democracy. In principle, there is little to object to in such well-intended goals. This paper, nonetheless, identifies several problems associated with slowdown, especially if presented as an incontestable doctrine. Despite its progressive feel, slowdown also stands for 1) a capitalist commodity; 2) a dangerous political objective that weaves together parochialism with fear-driven social sentiment; and 3) an undesired subjective experience. Finally, I evaluate recent propositions around ‘accelerationism’ and ask whether they might tackle the pitfalls of both social acceleration and slowness.

Employing games to collect data, classify images or even solve major scientific problems is a relatively new but growing phenomenon in citizen science. A main concern in citizen science is to ensure data quality. As games can be seen as having adverse effects on data quality, it is important to understand how citizen scientists produce data using games, how accurate this data can be, and whether and how games influence data quality. 
	
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of individual players’ data quality in MalariaSpot, a citizen science casual game in which volunteers are tasked with detecting parasites in digitized blood sample images.
	
Methods: We used descriptive statistics to analyze a subset of the gameplays recorded and stored in the MalariaSpot database, comparing its clicks to the Gold Standard position of the parasites. This subset includes 15,546 gameplays played over 38 known images that correspond to 97,200 clicks from 1,278 different players. Gameplays have been played via the Android and iOS applications and via the web version of the game. Images were acquired in three different locations and therefore sample preparation have been done by different lab technicians. Two distinct technologies were used for sample digitalization.

Results: The overall values for sensibility, specificity, and accuracy of the individual gameplays for the 38 images are 0.82, 0.60, and 0.29 respectively. High presence of parasites in an image makes it easier for players to detect them as their structures tend to look alike and can be compared. Being a simple casual game, the learning curve is very fast and after few minutes, players attend their typical performance level. Data quality is considerably lower in images acquired with mobile phones coupled to the microscope ocular compared to those digitized with standardized digitalization technologies. 
		 
Conclusions: The results indicate that data quality is influenced by the game, the technologies for image digitalization and the sampling preparation.",TRUE,FALSE,crowdsourcing; malaria; image analysis; games for health,2018-07-02T11:08:10.959516,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-26T12:26:45.417414,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/citation/,vztxn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jztpn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/relationships/node/,jztpn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a066fe9ad5a10253d3be16/,59a066fe9ad5a10253d3be16,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vztxn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vztxn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vztxn,NA

Understanding the Gender Gap,"Women who have sex with men have about one orgasm for every three her partner enjoys. We call this the “orgasm gap,” a persistent average difference in the frequency of orgasm for men and women who have heterosexual sex. In this paper, I discredit one common explanation for this gap—the idea that women are somehow bad at orgasms—and offer alternative explanations for the gendered asymmetry in this one type of sexual pleasure: a lack of knowledge, the de-prioritization of female sexual pleasure, sexual objectification and self-objectification, and the coital imperative in the sexual script.",TRUE,FALSE,coital imperative|gender|gender inequality|knowledge|orgasm|orgasm gap|self-objectification|sex|sex education|sexism|sexual behavior|sexuality|sexual objectification|sexual oientation|sexual pleasure|sexual script|women,2018-07-02T11:08:10.602667,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-26T04:01:18.024999,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/citation/,q2h8a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hw9tf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/relationships/node/,hw9tf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a0f23b9ad5a10252d3a20f/,59a0f23b9ad5a10252d3a20f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2h8a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q2h8a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q2h8a,NA
