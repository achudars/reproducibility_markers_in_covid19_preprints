However, as the present study on the derivation of syntactic word order (including subject-verb agreement configurations) in Arabic varieties shows, such functional elements/items can take a particular functional dimension within the functional domain they are part of. This study relies on sample examples from the literature on Arabic (the standard variety in particular, but also other varieties such as Tunisian Arabic and Moroccan Arabic – see Jouini, (2014) for typical sentences from these varieties) to demonstrate how functional elements can project as functional nodes or be merged as head or specifier (Spec) elements in the structure of sentences. In the inflectional domain of sentences – or Inflectional Phrase (IP) –, variation in subject-verb agreement configurations in Arabic rests on the premise that a Subject node variably projects giving rise to differing subject-verb agreement configurations. The same is true of the projection of the complementizer domain of sentences – or Complementizer Phrase (CP) – in Arabic, which splits into dedicated functional nodes in the standard variety of Arabic, but not in the modern spoken dialects. These differences in the projection of the IP-CP continuum establish functional relations upon which agreement and movement operations are derived and such notions as ‘topic’, ‘subject’ and ‘focus’ can be represented at the interface.",TRUE,FALSE,features|functional|Standard Arabic|subject-verb|Tunisian Arabic,2018-07-02T13:32:11.453761,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:43:20.619614,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/citation/,auspt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p9rty/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/relationships/node/,p9rty,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4c37a2409b000e9e1ba8/,5abc4c37a2409b000e9e1ba8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/auspt/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/auspt

The computer knowledge has begun influencing student’s learning experience for more than 25 years ago, but it was in a moderate manner (Cuban, 2001). However, the past decade has witnessed major trend toward integrating computer technology in all the language classes. The integration has increased because the computer technology represents an accessible and instant information, enormous potential for interactivity and media–rich communication, as well as educational tools which engage the students in the classroom (Mouza, 2002). Undoubtedly the recent advancement in information technology and computer usage in the classroom is rapidly transforming the environment of the classroom. The teachers cannot ignore the reality the today’s classroom must provide technology-supported learning (Angers &amp; Machtmes, 2005). Being prepared to integrate the technology in the classroom has become a paramount skill in every teacher’s professional repertoires. The traditional role of the teacher as the center of the schooling is changing recently with all the introduction of the new technologies in the classroom. One of the effects of the new technologies is the decentralization of teachers in the learning environment (Damrian, 1998). This introduces a very valid point of how the teaching profession will change in the era of digital technologies.  What is the role of the teacher in a classroom where he/she is no longer the only source of knowledge? How can he/ she teach effectively in a class, where every student has his/her computer and can Google any piece of information? The following study will investigate the effect of the implementation of the technology in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classes on the nature of the teachers’ profession.",TRUE,FALSE,|Digital immigrants|digital natives|integration|new technologies Technology-enhanced environment|Professionalism,2018-07-02T13:32:11.416446,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:43:36.418185,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/citation/,rnfjp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uhm75/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/relationships/node/,uhm75,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4b17266c2a000dc10fcb/,5abc4b17266c2a000dc10fcb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rnfjp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rnfjp

This present study examined the effects of extensive reading (ER) on Thai university students.  To measure their attitudes towards comfort, anxiety, intellectual value, practical value and linguistic value before and after 15-week extensive reading.  68 undergraduate students were asked to complete the 5-point Likert scale questionnaire of 23 items adopted from Yamashita (2013).  A semi-structure interview was also employed.  The results revealed students had positive feelings in which ER increased their comfort and decreased their anxiety at the significance level of 0.05.  They also had positive beliefs about the intellectual benefits.  However, the practical value that ER might bring advantages to students’ study or future career was lower in the posttest.  There was no significant difference between the pretest and posttest in their beliefs about English language study benefits.  Qualitative data from the semi-structured interviews showed that students satisfied with their own choice of reading preference.

Evaluating this programme, assessment rubrics, classroom observation notes, project presentations and professional development journals (PDJs) were analysed. Precisely, amongst these constructivist evaluative tools, this study aimed to explore the participants’ post-programme learning and reactions through a qualitative content analysis of their reflective PDJs. The revelations of this evaluative analysis about the participants’ learning and reactions would inevitably assess the value of this constructivist programme as well as its effectiveness and help make decisions for its improvement. Additionally, this analysis would significantly confirm the usefulness of PDJs as effective constructivist reflective tools for teachers’ conceptual and practical development.  After being collected, repeatedly read and qualitatively content-analysed, the participants’ coded PDJs (N=14) disclosed themes (N=6) and sub-themes (N=14) reflecting an amalgam of their learning and reactions. This cognitive and affective analysis of the participants’ reflections revealed signs of constructions of different ELT- and PD-related concepts, correction of some misconceptions together with traces of satisfaction, self-confidence and willpower. In the light of this study, the researcher strongly recommends PDJs for teachers to self/peer-assess and develop their teaching concepts and practice, and for programme facilitators to uncover and, therefore, meet teachers’ individual cognitive and affective needs.",TRUE,FALSE,Constructivist evaluation|professional development|reflection|reflective journals,2018-07-02T13:32:11.327170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:44:36.579828,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/citation/,75rxd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ct4py/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/relationships/node/,ct4py,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4662a2409b00109ddfc9/,5abc4662a2409b00109ddfc9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75rxd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75rxd

A glimpse of the debate over the written versus the spoken form,"The primacy of speech in second language learning and the relative lack of importance of the written form have triggered a continuous debate in the field of language teaching methodology. The various approaches which have been developed throughout the years emphasise the importance of the spoken language. Therefore, the written form has been taken for granted in most teaching methodologies. This paper considers the question of whether second language learners learn best through spoken or written language. It reviews the literature with regard to how speaking and writing have been taught in the last two decades. In addition, it describes the differences between spoken and written forms of languages. The paper then presents some characteristics and features of both language forms and states the situation of teaching English in a foreign language context. The paper concludes that both spoken and written aspects of any language are important in language learning and they both complement one another. Second language learners need to learn both aspects in order to master the language. The degree of exposure to spoken or written language is yet determined by the learners’ purpose for learning the language.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language|language learning|spoken language|teaching methodologies|written language,2018-07-02T13:32:11.283655,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:45:04.467497,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/citation/,n6aeb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7ut3q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/relationships/node/,7ut3q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc457ba2409b00109ddf0f/,5abc457ba2409b00109ddf0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n6aeb/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n6aeb

A mixed method, which contains both quantitative and qualitative research design, was used to collect data. Research instruments comprised a perception opinionnaire designed to measure the perceptions of EFL pre-service teachers towards the challenges they face in teaching experience during the practicum. The results showed that EFL pre-service teachers considered the observation period during the Teaching Practicum (1) Course between moderately and extremely beneficial. The results of the perceptions of EFL pre-service teachers regarding classroom-teaching skills were between highly and moderately to low challenging. Additionally, their skills related to school environment indicated less challenging than skills related to classroom teaching experiences. The results of the open-ended question were divided into three meaningful and thoughtful categories to add much depth and understanding of the research problem. Some recommendations based on the results were derived. For example, EFL pre-service teachers needed further development in teaching experiences and skills related to classrooms and school setting.

It elucidates the linguistic dilemma of the present times and identifies space for bilingualism and pluriculturalism. To make the readers acquainted with Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), the authors corroborate the detailed theoretical framework by establishing links with growing trends of cross continent migration, rising globalisation and expansion of multicultural and multiethnic contexts in the educational arena. A brief prehistory of CLIL has also been explored to justify its birth in helping out the linguists and educationists in Europe and beyond. The paper delineates the theory of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) diagrammatically employing content, cognition and communication in a linguistic culture. It explicates the various nomenclatures, dimensions, functions and the developmental stages of CLIL pedagogy at the dawn of the new millennium. After exploring the theoretical, functional and futuristic facets of CLIL, it is concluded that CLIL is an apt, economical and timely framework of bringing diverse cultures and languages closer to one another and can help build cosmopolitan identity of learners in the Knowledge Age.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T13:32:11.033937,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:45:50.206442,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/citation/,kqwxu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ap34h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/relationships/node/,ap34h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc3a57266c2a000dc0ff83/,5abc3a57266c2a000dc0ff83,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqwxu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kqwxu/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kqwxu

Indeed, students need to develop the necessary 21st century skills that enable them to thrive for today’s economy. According to the Educational Testing Service (ETS) (2007), the 21st century learning skills refer to the ability to a) collect and/or retrieve information, b) organize and manage information, c) evaluate the quality, relevance, and usefulness of information, and d) generate accurate information through the use of existing resources. To achieve this goal, teachers’ professional identity has been further questioned, thereby generating debates and issues regarding their role. What teachers need to know, what beliefs they should hold and how they can achieve their professional development, are among the core intentions of today’s teacher education. Within this concern, this article aims to explore teachers’ professional identity to support teachers and teacher students understand their role and the conception of learning in 21st century education",TRUE,FALSE,beliefs|emotions|knowledge|professional development|teacher identity,2018-07-02T13:32:10.993204,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:46:01.875148,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/citation/,j63xf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mea2n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/relationships/node/,mea2n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc3927266c2a000ec0dfd9/,5abc3927266c2a000ec0dfd9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j63xf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j63xf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j63xf
