This study examines the origins of these epistemologies. Drawing on an insight that different modes of comparison yield different types of knowledge, this study argues that the network structure of how cases are compared constrains or enables the development of a field’s theoretical sensibilities. Analysis of comparative studies of revolution published from 1970 to 2009 reveals that the field overall is most amenable to knowledge about particular cases rather than the phenomenon of revolution broadly. Analysis of the changing structure of comparison over time reveals that comparison precedes the development of an epistemology.

In this work, I will analyze the racialized subjectivity and identity (trans)formation of a diaspora of African Americans who partook in an intergenerational migration from the plantations of central Alabama to the coalfields of southeastern Kentucky in the first half of the 20th century, and then moved on to urban cities throughout the United States throughout the Civil Rights-era.  The latter generation of migrants collectively experienced major shifts in the social structures of their community of origin, such as transitioning from “colored schools” to a State mandated integrated school system, retrenchment in the labor economy of a single-industry community, and the subsequent mass out-migration from their community of origin. These jolts to the social structures of their society not only altered their horizon of opportunity, but also resulted in major dislocations in the cultural systems that informed their collective identity.  Particular to the case, I am concerned with the ways in which these cultural traumas—memories of events that collectivities believe rended the social fabric of their society—impacted the collective identity of this diaspora.  In spite of their geographic dispersion, this generation of migrants has managed to stay connected through a set of “invented traditions” that they constituted at the tail end of their out-migration.  For example, the Eastern Kentucky Social Club—an organization established by this group of migrants in 1970—has hosted a reunion in different cities across the country every year for the last forty-four years.  At its height, this event drew over 3,000 African American migrants from across the country.  The broader aim of the project is to reconstruct the rich history and culture of this special population of Black Appalachians to put forth a re-examination of W.E.B. Du Bois’ phenomenological analysis of racialized subjectivity and African American identity formation in 20th century America.

The overarching research questions that guide this study are (1) How do we explain the emergence of their post-migration diasporic identity? (2) How has their collective identity been negotiated, transformed and reinscribed through their changing, and sometimes contested, subjectivity as racialized American citizens through the continuum of the pre and post civil rights era? I will specifically focus on three events that have been the site of transformation for the individuals in my case, (1) the school desegregation process—an event that occurred almost a decade after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision in this region, (2) the mass out-migration from southeastern Kentucky—a community level event that was a precursor to the emergence of their diasporic identity, and (3) the construction of the EKAAMP archive—an event that marks the institutional transference from memory to history.  These eventful temporalities provide three categories of analysis that will allow me to make important linkages to my research questions in the context of the past, present, and future.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:06:53.273839,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-18T23:19:44.267786,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,Karida L. brown,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/citation/,6qrdp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f98sx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/relationships/node/,f98sx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59977498b83f69025064f6f1/,59977498b83f69025064f6f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrdp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qrdp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qrdp,NA

This appears in the language used in the fields, and in the sometimes implicit assumptions made in discussions of them. We give examples from articulations of the so-called Fermi Paradox, discussions of the settlement of the Solar System (in the near future) and the Galaxy (in the far future), and METI. We argue that science fiction, especially the campy variety, is a significant contributor to the ‘giggle factor’ that hinders serious discussion and funding for SETI and Solar System settlement projects. We argue that humanity's long-term future in space will be shaped by our short-term visions for who goes there and how. Because of the way they entered the fields, we recommend avoiding the term ‘colony’ and its cognates when discussing the settlement of space, as well as other terms with similar pedigrees. We offer examples of science fiction and other writing that broaden and challenge our visions of human futures in space and SETI. In an appendix, we use an analogy with the well-funded and relatively uncontroversial searches for the dark matter particle to argue that SETI's lack of funding in the national science portfolio is primarily a problem of perception, not inherent merit.

However, life expectancy at birth is more easily communicated and understood by the public. By properly situating climate change mortality within the contexts of life expectancy, we better represent the cost of climate change on longevity. In this paper, we convert excess mortality estimates due to increases in extreme weather from climate change into potential reductions in life expectancy at birth in thirty-one European countries. We project climate change extremes to reduce life expectancy at birth by 0.24 years for the average European country with differences in excess of 1.0 years in some countries by the end of the century. We only estimate the impact of mortality directly related to climate extremes, making our estimates conservative.

These tools include a decision tree to identify candidate students and elucidate successful placement in general education. Candidate students enter a 7-step process. In 2015-2016, we undertook a pilot implementation of these tools and facilitated the transition of 10 of 20 students from self-contained academic special education classrooms into general education placements. In 2016-2017, we extended this process to include 4 schools. 16 of 53 students from self-contained academic special education classrooms transitioned into general education placements. Extending the model district-wide, 9 of 26 students from behavior/SEL unit classrooms, and 9 of 9 students from Life Skills/SID classrooms transitioned into a general education placement. A high percentage of the remaining candidates received &gt;50% of their day in general education classrooms and/or were placed in less restrictive self-contained classrooms. Overall, 54% of identified candidate students were able to access a less restrictive environment as defined by IDEIA.

Seeking genetic confirmation of personal identities and having a strong ideology of the genetic basis of race and the value of white “purity,” white nationalists using GATs are sometimes confronted with information they consider evidence of non-white or non-European ancestry. Despite their essentialist views of race, Stormfront posters use GAT information to police individuals’ membership far less commonly than working to develop a variety of scientific and anti-scientific responses enabling them to repair identities by rejecting or reinterpreting GAT results. Simultaneously, however, Stormfront posters use the particular relationships made visible by GATs to debate the collective boundaries and constitution of white nationalism. Bricoleurs with genetic knowledge, white nationalists use a “racial realist” interpretive framework that departs from canons of genetic science but cannot be dismissed simply as ignorant.",TRUE,FALSE,boundary work|genetic ancestry tests|genetics|Identity|identity repair|kinship|online community|public understanding of science|racism|social dimensions of science|social movements|stigma|symbolic boundaries|white nationalism,2018-07-02T11:06:50.468026,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-17T14:16:26.238384,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/citation/,7f9bc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mqd54/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/relationships/node/,mqd54,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5995a3449ad5a1025322287e/,5995a3449ad5a1025322287e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7f9bc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7f9bc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7f9bc,NA

Building on the qualitative findings, we conduct a lab study to examine how racial minority job seekers change their résumés in response to different job postings. Results show that when targeting an employer that presents itself as valuing diversity, minority job applicants engage in relatively little résumé whitening and thus submit more racially transparent résumés. Yet our audit study of how employers respond to whitened and unwhitened résumés shows that organizational diversity statements are not actually associated with reduced discrimination against unwhitened résumés. Taken together, these findings suggest a paradox: minorities may be particularly likely to experience disadvantage when they apply to ostensibly pro-diversity employers. These findings illuminate the role of racial concealment and transparency in modern labor markets and point to an important interplay between the self-presentation of employers and the self-presentation of job seekers in shaping economic inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|diversity|diversity statements|employment|hiring|race|whitening,2018-07-02T11:06:49.243205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-16T13:13:44.191265,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Sonia Kang|Katherine DeCelles|András Tilcsik|Sora Jun,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/citation/,6p2r4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m9b6a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/relationships/node/,m9b6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5994426a9ad5a10255569e68/,5994426a9ad5a10255569e68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p2r4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6p2r4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6p2r4,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839216639577
