to punish accused infringers or require them to disgorge their profits. The
statute provides for damages ""adequate to compensate for the infringement,
but in no event less than a reasonable royalty."" Courts interpreting this
provision have divided patent damages into two groups - lost profits,
available to patent owners who would have made sales in the absence of
infringement, and reasonable royalties, available to everyone else.
Traditionally, patentees want to prove lost profits, because only that
measure captures the monopoly value of exclusion of competitors from the
market. As the statutory language suggests, reasonable royalties exist as a
floor or backstop for those who cannot prove that they have lost profits as
a result of infringement.

In practice, however, the lines between lost profits and reasonable
royalties are blurring. In significant part this is because courts have
insisted on strict standards of proof for entitlement to lost profits.
Specifically, patentees must prove demand for the patented product, the
absence of noninfringing substitutes, the ability to meet additional demand
in the absence of infringement, and the proportion of those sales that
represent profits. This in turn means that many patent owners who have in
fact probably lost sales to infringement cannot prove lost profits damages,
and turn to the reasonable royalty measure. The result is that courts have
distorted the reasonable royalty measure in various ways, adding ""kickers""
to increase damages, artificially raising the reasonable royalty rate, or
importing inapposite concepts like the ""entire market value rule"" in an
effort to compensate patent owners whose real remedy probably should have
been in the lost profits category.

In Part I, I explain the strict requirements for proving lost profits, and
give examples of patentees who have failed to meet these requirements. In
Part II, I explain how relegating these patentees to reasonable royalties
has led to problematic changes in reasonable royalty law. Finally, I
suggest in Part III that courts should draw a sharp division between the
injury suffered by patentees who compete with infringers and those who do
not. Patentees who compete should be entitled to the best estimate of lost
profits, even if not all elements of proof are available. Doing so will
avoid overcompensating patent owners in reasonable royalty cases.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:32.043018,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:41:25.999000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/citation/,7mwn2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jrqg6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/relationships/node/,jrqg6,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcd117b83f6901f3655e87/,57bcd117b83f6901f3655e87,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7mwn2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7mwn2

property (IP) law. In Confusion over Use: Contextualism in Trademark Law,
Graeme Dinwoodie and Mark Janis characterize it as a dispute over whether
to limit trademark holder rights in a new and unanticipated way. Yet there
is another - in our view more historically accurate - way to frame the
trademark use debate: the question is whether courts should, absent
specific statutory authorization, allow trademark holders to assert a new
and unprecedented form of trademark infringement claim. The pop-up and
keyword cases involve attempts to impose third-party liability under the
guise of direct infringement suits. Dinwoodie and Janis's thorough account
notwithstanding, it remains the fact that, before the recent spate of
Internet-related cases, no court had ever recognized a trademark claim of
the sort that trademark holders are now asserting. Trademark infringement
suits have always involved allegations of infringement by parties who use
marks in connection with the promotion of their own goods and services. The
question raised by the trademark use cases, as we view it, is whether
courts should countenance a radical departure from that traditional model
without specific instruction from Congress. We think they should not.

In this paper, we explain the origins of trademark use doctrine in
traditional limits on the scope of the trademark right and in the
distinction between direct and contributory infringement. We also explain
why we cannot simply rely on the likelihood of consumer confusion test to
solve the problems the trademark use doctrine addresses, and we examine the
difficult problem of defining the scope of the trademark use doctrine.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:03.620990,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:39:43.251000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/citation/,yn27k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eezc2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/relationships/node/,eezc2,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcd0ee9ad5a1020668d2d4/,57bcd0ee9ad5a1020668d2d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yn27k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yn27k

large number of suits, now a majority of all patent assertions in the
country and an even higher percentage in the information technology (IT)
industries. They win both larger judgments and larger settlements than do
“practicing entities” (“PEs”) -- those that practice patents and are not
principally in the business of collecting money from others that practice
them. And they do so despite complaints that trolls assert weak patents and
some evidence that troll patents are more likely to lose in court.

Nonetheless, we think the focus on patent trolls obscures a more complex
set of challenges confronting the patent system. In this paper, we make
three points. First, patent trolls are not a unitary phenomenon. We see at
least three different troll business models developing, and those models
have different effects on the patent system. Second, patent assertions by
practicing entities can create just as many problems as assertions by
patent trolls. The nature of many industries obscures some of the costs of
those assertions, but that does not mean they are cost-free. In addition,
practicing entities are increasingly engaging in “patent privateering,” in
which product-producing companies take on many of the attributes of trolls.
Put differently, while trolls exploit problems with the patent system, they
are not the only ones that do so. Third, many of the problems associated
with trolls are in fact problems that stem from the disaggregation of
complementary patents into too many different hands. That in turn suggests
that groups like Intellectual Ventures might be reducing, not worsening,
these problems (though, as we will see, the overall effects are ambiguous),
while “patent privateers” that spin off patents in order for others to
assert them might make things worse. For this reason, patent reformers and
antitrust authorities should worry less about aggregation of patent rights
and more about disaggregation of those rights, sometimes accomplished by
spinning them out to others.

Understanding the economics of patent assertions by both trolls and
practicing entities allows us to move beyond labels and the search for “bad
actors,” focusing instead on aspects of the patent system itself that give
rise to the problems and on specific, objectionable conduct in which both
trolls and practicing entities sometimes engage. Patent trolls alone are
not the problem; they are a symptom of larger problems with the patent
system. Treating the symptom will not solve the problems. In a very real
sense, critics have been missing the forest for the trolls. Exposing the
larger problems allows us to contemplate changes in patent law that will
actually tackle the underlying pathologies of the patent system and the
abusive conduct they enable.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:04.293654,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:31:09.579000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/citation/,r5nfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gm4ur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/relationships/node/,gm4ur,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcceae9ad5a101f868d4c7/,57bcceae9ad5a101f868d4c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r5nfd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r5nfd
