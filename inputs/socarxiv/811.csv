The theoretical framework draws on a symbolic interactionist perspective, focusing on how meaning is constructed through blogging practices, supplemented by theories of mediation and critical technology studies. The principal evidence in this study is derived from an analysis of in-depth interviews with bloggers selected to maximise their diversity based on the results of an initial survey. This is supplemented by an analysis of personal blogging’s technical contexts and of various societal influences that appear to influence blogging practices.

Bloggers were found to have limited interest in gathering information about their readers, appearing to rely instead on an assumption that readers are sympathetic. Although personal blogging practices have been framed as being a form of radically free expression, they were also shown to be subject to potential biases including social norms and the technical characteristics of blogging services. Blogs provide a persistent record of a blogger’s practice, but the bloggers in this study did not generally read their archives or expect others to do so, nor did they retrospectively edit their archives to maintain a consistent self-presentation.

The empirical results provide a basis for developing a theoretical perspective to account for blogging practices. This emphasises firstly that a blogger’s construction of the meaning of their practice can be based as much on an imagined and desired social context as it is on an informed and reflexive understanding of the communicative situation. Secondly, blogging practices include a variety of envisaged audience relationships, and some blogging practices appear to be primarily
self-directed with potential audiences playing a marginal role. Blogging’s technical characteristics and the social norms surrounding blogging practices appear to enable and reinforce this unanticipated lack of engagement with audiences. This perspective contrasts with studies of computer mediated communication that suggest bloggers would monitor their audiences and present themselves strategically to ensure interactions are successful in their terms. The study also points the way towards several avenues for further research including a more in-depth consideration of the neglected structural factors (both social and technical) which potentially influence blogging practices, and an examination of social network site use practices using a similar analytical approach.",TRUE,FALSE,audience|Blogging|computer mediated communication|Feenberg|Goffman|Preprint|socarxiv|Social Media|symbolic interaction|weblog,2018-07-02T10:51:43.080016,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-13T22:06:45.988000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/citation/,mrq9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h6zur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/relationships/node/,h6zur,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786bb7b594d9001f119db16/,5786bb7b594d9001f119db16,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrq9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrq9v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrq9v

incomes in the United States, especially “the 1%” Newly analyzed tax data
revealed that top incomes had begun a dramatic upward climb in the early
1980s. This article investigates why it took two decades for this increase
to become politically and academically salient. I show how experts
assembled two “regimes of perceptibility” for producing knowledge about
income inequality, and that neither was capable of tracking top incomes.
Macroeconomists focused on labor’s share of national income, but ignored
the distribution of income between individuals. Labor economists drew on
newly avail- able survey data to explain wage disparities. By relying on
surveys, these scholars unintentionally eliminated top incomes from view:
surveys top-coded high incomes and thus were incapable of detecting the
rise of the 1%. Studies of top incomes that relied on income tax data fell
by the wayside, creating the conditions under which experts, policymakers,
and the public alike could be surprised by the rise of the 1%. This
historical study offers insights into the political power of economic
expertise by clarifying the complex linkages between observations, stylized
facts, causal theories, and policy attention.",TRUE,FALSE,socarxiv|workingpaper,2018-07-02T10:45:17.915138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-13T20:32:34.549000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/citation/,4dws8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/228dt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/relationships/node/,228dt,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5786a566594d9001f419daf0/,5786a566594d9001f419daf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dws8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4dws8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4dws8

Further, consumption of pornography remains a major difference in the sexual experiences of men and women. Yet research has not addressed how opposition to pornography has changed over the this period, despite shifts in the accessibility and visibility of pornography as well as new cultural and legal issues presented by the advent of Internet pornography. We examine gender differences in opposition to pornography from 1975 to 2012, measured by support for legal censorship of pornography in the General Social Survey. Results show that both men’s and women’s opposition to pornography have decreased significantly over the past 40 years, suggesting a cultural shift toward “pornographication” affecting attitudes. However, women remain more opposed to pornography than men, and men’s opposition has declined faster, so the gender gap in opposition to pornography has widened, indicating further divergence of men’s and women’s sexual
attitudes over time. This is consistent with the increasingly normative nature of pornography consumption for men, increases over time in men’s actual consumption of pornography, and its increasingly degrading depiction
of women.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:17.964036,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-13T20:03:33.153000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/citation/,4dymx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ub9su/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/relationships/node/,ub9su,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57869e96b83f6901eea2988b/,57869e96b83f6901eea2988b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dymx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4dymx/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496515604170,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4dymx
