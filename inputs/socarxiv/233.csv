At a school serving working-class Latino youth, students are told their digital expressions are irrelevant to learning; at a school with mostly middle-class Asian American youth, students’ digital expressions are seen as threats to their ability to succeed academically; and at a private school with mainly wealthy white youth, students’ digital skills are positioned as essential to school success.

This study demonstrates how firms’ core market actions (e.g., market entry or geographic expansion) can function as CPA. We theorize two mechanisms through which firms leverage market actions as CPA—“pork” and “perk.” We document these mechanisms through an empirical analysis of data from the U.S. airline industry over 30 years (1990-2019). Specifically, we find that airlines increase the supply of flights from airports in the home district of the Chair of the Transportation Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives (pork). Moreover, this increase in flight supplies is negatively associated with formal policy changes in Congress. We also find that the airlines increase the supply of flights to Washington, D.C. from the home district of the Speaker of the House and the home state of the Senate Majority Leader (perk).

In this paper we consider two potential reasons for the zero effects: a) that it is the selection into partnerships rather than assortative mating according to specific characteristics that matters; and b) that for assortative mating to matter, a broader spectrum of matching characteristics than just education should be considered, such as matching by employment and social origin. We study these assumptions using register data on household income inequalities, education, employment and parental class background in Finland 1991–2014. We analyze men and women separately and focus on individuals aged 35–40. We concentrate on between group income inequality as measured by the Theil index. The results suggest that selection into partnership is an important factor behind income inequality and can explain most of the changes in income inequality. Assortative mating does not matter much, even if more sorting characteristics are taken into account.

The impact of geographical mobility on children's educational attainment in Finland and Germany.,"It is often assumed that families migrate to improve their economic and social prospects, and that these additional resources can benefit the whole family. However, existing research suggests that many children who have experienced (internal) migration underperform compared to their non-migrating peers in terms of different socioeconomic outcomes. In this paper, we study the effects of geographical mobility on children’s educational attainment in Finland and Germany using Finnish register data and the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) respectively.
Our findings indicate that moving during childhood is associated with the risk of not attaining any secondary degree in both countries. In Finland, this is mostly explained by negative selection into moving, (i.e. those who move are more likely to be disadvantaged). For Germany however, an independent association between moving and educational attainment remains after taking into account various reasons why families move. Furthermore, for both Germany and Finland, any labour force status or earning gains parents make, after a move, do not seem to compensate for the negative influence of internal migration on children’s educational attainment. Overall, we conclude that that when children move something remains behind, therefore schools have an important role to play in integrating internal migrants – as well as international migrants – into the social networks of the schools they arrive in.",TRUE,FALSE,INVEST Flagship Working Papers,2020-03-30T13:26:20.631199,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-30T13:26:12.747918,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Patricia McMullin,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/citation/,528vw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e819e711ab2430099e02a4b/,5e819e711ab2430099e02a4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/528vw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/528vw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/528vw

This article puts forth that occupational context—and specifically, the stereotypes about gay men and lesbians evoked by certain occupational contexts—play an important role in shaping bias against gay men and lesbians in the labor force. I argue that people are implicitly guided by cultural stereotypes about gay men and lesbians, which affects perceptions about whether they are suitable for specific occupations. This leads to penalties for being openly gay or lesbian in some occupational scenarios, but may lead to less or no penalties in others. This theory is tested empirically using a list experiment, a methodological technique designed to reduce or eliminate social desirability bias in responses. Results suggest that bias against gay men and lesbians is not standard across all occupations or subgroups of gay employees, but rather, is shaped by important contextual factors that can activate certain stereotypes about gay and lesbian individuals.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|employment|experiment|gay|inequality|lesbian|list experiment,2020-03-30T04:46:15.489068,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-30T04:45:54.313934,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/citation/,gpc67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ksd8f/,ksd8f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e80f1a6d0e3540079b458c5/,5e80f1a6d0e3540079b458c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gpc67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gpc67/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gpc67

The voter controls the politician via election and the politician provides incentives to bureaucrats, who may have conflicting interests. We show that when times are conducive to high quality governance -- budgets are large and players are farsighted -- incorporating the bureaucratic layer of the hierarchy makes for weaker accountability standards. However, when times are tough and budgets are small or players are myopic it is possible that voters may benefit from increasing their demands on elected officials.

We create hot spots using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, using law enforcement cost of crime estimates as weights.

We also show that the hierarchical clustering algorithm captures a wide array of hot spot types; some one or two addresses, some street segments, and others an agglomeration of larger areas. This suggests identifying hot spots based on a specific unit of aggregation (e.g. addresses, street segments), may be less efficient than using a hierarchical clustering technique in practice.

It focuses on studying the reform of the telecommunications sector in Mexico from the administrations of Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988 – 1994) to Enrique Peña Nieto (2012 – 2018). The process of creating a common understanding of the problem and its solutions contribute to generating policy change. It considers that the president is an actor that takes an active role in policymaking. This analysis uses a most-similar comparative approach. The analysis shows that policy changes are sensitive to presidential policy entrepreneurship.,TRUE,FALSE,agenda-setting|comparative|policy change|presidential policy entrepreneurship|presidents|telecommunications,2020-03-30T04:44:10.204258,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-30T04:43:52.240109,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/citation/,hn2zj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7f9e111ab2430042e058f3/,5e7f9e111ab2430042e058f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hn2zj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hn2zj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hn2zj
