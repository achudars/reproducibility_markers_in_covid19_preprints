This study aims to explain public opinion toward cell phone contact tracing using a survey experiment conducted with a representative sample of Canadian respondents. We build upon an established theory in evolutionary psychology—disease avoidance—to predict how media coverage of the pandemic affects public support for containment measures. We report three key findings. First, exposure to a news item that shows people ignoring social distancing rules causes an increase in support for cell phone contact tracing. Second, pre-treatment covariates such as anxiety and a belief that other people are not following the rules rank among the strongest predictors of support for COVID-19 apps. And third, while a majority of respondents approve the reliance on cell phone contact tracing, many of them hold ambivalent thoughts about the technology.

Using weekly panel data for 620 U.S. counties, we show park visits decreased by 10% beginning March 15, and by 17-35% through May 9, 2020. Net of weekly sample trends, park visits decreased by 2.3% when stay-at-home orders were in effect, yet increased by 8.3% after school closures and 4.1% after business closures. Park visits decreased less during the pandemic in metropolitan counties or where park availability was high.

We show that an air pollution regulation limiting ozone precursors emissions has delivered substantial benefits to bird conservation. Our results imply that air quality improvements over the past four decades have stemmed the decline in bird populations, averting the loss of 1.5 billion birds, approximately 20 percent of current totals.

Recent evidence suggests that domestic war may have short-term effects on participation in social organizations. Yet, it is unclear whether these effects will be present in internationalized conflicts and persist over long periods of time. Further, the pathways of persistence by which war exposure leads to greater civic engagement in the long-term are even less understood. In this paper, I contribute to both questions using unique evidence from the Vietnam War. Empirically, I combine a unique U.S. military dataset containing bombing intensity with respondents' wartime place of residence to generate an objective indicator of conflict intensity. Then, I exploit the distance to the arbitrarily drawn border at the seventeenth parallel as an instrument for conflict intensity. The results show that individuals who lived in a province heavily affected by the conflict during the war tend to be more engaged in social organizations and hold greater expressive values, at least, 26 years later. Further, I empirically explore the mechanisms of persistence. The empirical evidence suggests that both persistence within individuals and community-wide transmission jointly account for the long-term increase of civic engagement after conflict.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-02T16:10:10.168216,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-02T16:09:35.515813,FALSE,NA,no,The data will be made available upon publication.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/citation/,67zkf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efddca7ea59af00b9d327b0/,5efddca7ea59af00b9d327b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67zkf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/67zkf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/67zkf

The Billions to Trillions agenda, the World Bank’s Maximising Finance for Development or the G20’s Infrastructure as an Asset Class all call on international development institutions and governments of poor countries to ‘escort capital’ – institutional investors and the managers of their trillions in assets – into investable development assets. For this, ten policy commandments aim to forge the de-risking state and accelerate the structural transformation of local financial systems towards market-based finance.

Funding can affect which research topics get addressed, and what research outputs are produced. However, funding has often been studied simplistically, using top-down or system-led perspectives. These can restrict analysis to national funding landscapes or single funding organisations and instruments in isolation. This overlooks interlinkages and potentially broader funding that researchers might access. We instead frame an alternative ‘bottom-up’ approach, using individual researchers as the entry point. For two test research fields (food science, renewable energy research) we analyse articles published 2009–18 as an example funded research activity. Here we trace researcher funding via article funding acknowledgements (FAs) of researchers affiliated to Denmark, the Netherlands or Norway. We then map field-level ‘co-funding networks’. These turn out to include heterogeneous funding from inside, outside and across these test countries. We further study article-level ‘funding amalgamations’ – the sum of all authors’ reported funding per article. These similarly show highly varied (co-)funding by funder ‘type’ (public, private, university or non-profit) and ‘origin’ (domestic, foreign or supranational). We note this approach has certain limitations but suggest it does advance our understanding of research funding dynamics. It provides an additional perspective, and appears adaptable to further analyses (e.g. of potential influences of co-funding). We lastly suggest several implications for science policy stemming from this bottom-up approach.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-02T08:50:44.111829,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-02T08:50:28.189501,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/citation/,tg6vn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efd9cfbaf115600a43b4805/,5efd9cfbaf115600a43b4805,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg6vn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tg6vn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tg6vn

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown, students are at risk of losing months or in certain cases missing sessions in the next step in their education. The situation is so dire that UNESCO has called it a worldwide unprecedented education emergency. 

Universities in Bangladesh and the university students in Bangladesh are also facing the same emergency. Online learning can be a potential solution to this problem. Such online learning requires facilities and infrastructure at the universities, a robust data infrastructure at the national level, and adequate computing devices and sufficient and affordable data services for the students.

However, very little concrete data exists to understand whether the universities and the students have the technical and financial means to make such online classes effective and successful.  

This study is one of  the first in Bangladesh that attempts to gauge the need and readiness of various stakeholders to implement successful fully online education. This paper suggests a process for measuring the readiness. The results can give the policymakers ideas on areas of improvement and may assist universities to launch fully online classes that will be accessible and affordable by students during and beyond the COVID-19 lockdown phase.",TRUE,FALSE,Bangladesh|COVID-19|Education Quality|Online education|Pandemic|Private Universities|Public Universities|Study Gap|Tertiary Education|University Education,2020-07-02T07:46:20.688959,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-02T07:46:01.030079,FALSE,NA,no,Data may be shared after the execution of a data sharing agreement,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/citation/,p6mws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efd773abee66500a3f98a5a/,5efd773abee66500a3f98a5a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6mws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p6mws/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p6mws

Yet, scholars have directed little attention to the on-the-ground racial consequences of limited public postsecondary funding for students. In this article we ask: How is the defunding of public higher education reflected in the organizational practices of a university serving historically underrepresented students? And how do resource constraints affect racially (and often economically) marginalized students’ access to core university services? We draw on a year-long case study of a University of California campus serving a majority Latinx and low-income student body, including ethnographic observations and interviews with administrators, student-facing staff, student activists and organizers, and Black and Latinx students. Our findings identify defunding as a contemporary mechanism through which racial disparities in postsecondary educational experiences are maintained.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-02T07:42:47.463116,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-02T07:42:28.265102,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,Laura T.
