In contrast, mental accounting holds that appropriate uses for income vary by source, making them infungible. This study investigates which theory better describes giving at the margin when income may have multiple sources. Dictators accrue differing amounts of (1) earned income from a real-effort task, (2) windfall income, or (3) both. I find that dictators treat marginal earned and windfall income as partially infungible, supporting mental accounting. Dictators who had a single income source gave 14% of a marginal windfall token and 5% of a marginal earned token. Strikingly, dictators who had income from both sources were sharply less generous with each, giving only 2% and 1%, respectively. Multiple accounts enabled greater selfishness at the margin.

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we tracked families from 5 years before child with ND birth until the child reached 20 years of age and used latent growth curve modeling to estimate different trajectories for risk of two indicators: poverty and economic hardship. In bivariate terms, families raising a child with ND had higher risks of poverty and economic hardship across time. Five latent growth trajectories were identified for each indicator. After controlling for family and caregiver characteristics that preceded the birth of the child with an ND, families raising a child with a ND were more likely to experience persistent economic hardship. However, raising a child with a ND was not associated with a unique poverty risk, suggesting that families already in poverty are more likely to remain poor if they have a child with a ND.

Racial Residential Segregation and Educational Attainment,"Is racial residential segregation or integration a stronger predictor of educational attainment? Does the racialized direction of this relationship matter? Drawing from Wilson’s (1987) social isolation theory and Massey and Denton’s (1993) theory of racial segregation and poor neighborhood formation, I propose that 1) greater residential racial homogeneity and 2) greater white residential segregation will increase average educational attainment at the county level. I analyze data from the 2016 County Health Rankings and Roadmaps along with the 5-year 2011-2015 American Community Survey, both of which yield a total population size of 3,141 counties. The study reveals that the impact of residential segregation on academic achievement is indeed racialized: white residential segregation most strongly affects county percent high school graduation. General residential segregation, however, is positively and significantly related to high school and graduate/PhD degree level completion. Nevertheless, median household income and county rurality are consistently the strongest predictors of high school and graduate/PhD completion across four regression models. While these results confirm both hypotheses, they highlight the strength of alternative explanations for educational gaps in the United States—gaps that may be more directly tied to social capital and rurality. The findings suggest that policies intending to alleviate disparities in educational attainment cannot center segregation alone, they must also offer a broader solution to social isolation and resource deprivation patterns by targeting counties with lower median household incomes and greater rurality.",TRUE,FALSE,education|income inequality|residential segregation,2018-07-02T11:28:50.771164,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-12T20:05:16.862762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/citation/,a4qvk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qe3gf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/relationships/node/,qe3gf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a30079e9da410000feb014d/,5a30079e9da410000feb014d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a4qvk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a4qvk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a4qvk

This search engine, unlike traditional databases, automatically indexes information from the academic web. Its ease of use, together with its wide coverage and fast indexing speed, have made it the first tool most scientists currently turn to when they need to carry out a literature search. Additionally, the fact that its search results were accompanied from the beginning by citation counts, as well as the later development of secondary products which leverage this citation data (such as Google Scholar Metrics and Google Scholar Citations), made many scientists wonder about its potential as a source of data for bibliometric analyses. The goal of this chapter is to lay the foundations for the use of GS as a supplementary source (and in some disciplines, arguably the best alternative) for scientific evaluation. First, we present a general overview of how GS works. Second, we present empirical evidences about its main characteristics (size, coverage, and growth rate). Third, we carry out a systematic analysis of the main limitations this search engine presents as a tool for the evaluation of scientific performance.

Spillovers among facilities owned by the same firm likely play an important role in the diffusion of P2 practices. This paper estimates the intrafirm spillover effects of P2 adoption. Using instrumental variables methods applied to facility panel data from the Toxics Release Inventory, we find that a facility’s own adoption of P2 practices increases in response to greater P2 adoption by facilities from the same firm.

Here, we analyze greater than 24,000 MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) transcriptions of Western classical music from 197 composers spanning from the 15th to 20th centuries. The unique file format of MIDI files (notes of discrete frequencies turning “on” and “off” at specific times) allows us to statistically quantify note usage with respect to pitch class and intervals. We first perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on pitch class and show that the data creates a ring. Songs strongly associated with a particular key fall on the ring, whereas highly chromatic and atonal works fall in the center, revealing that the evolution of Western music is constrained by the circle of fifths. We then examine interval usage. Discriminant analysis on composer identity reveals that a major source of evolutionary change is incremental and linear. Interval usage predicts individual composer identity at levels above chance. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) reveals four major groups of composers with similar tonal styles. These groups are loosely based on traditional musical eras, but reveal unexpected continuity between co-existing schools of composers.",TRUE,FALSE,corpus analysis|history|music|tonality,2018-07-02T11:28:49.760277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-11T19:26:50.242434,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d47|Arts and Humanities|Music|Other Music,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/citation/,btshk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rkptu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/relationships/node/,rkptu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a2ec6553e0297000d8232d0/,5a2ec6553e0297000d8232d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/btshk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/btshk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/btshk
