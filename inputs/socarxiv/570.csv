After the war, Hawtrey advocated drastic budgetary and monetary rigor in the name of price stabilization. From 1922, Hawtrey admitted the need to decrease the bank rate; yet he remained an adamant supporter of the Gold Standard, insisting on its maintenance even if it required further monetary revaluation. Hawtrey's policy prescriptions stemmed directly from his economic model.

Compensation benchmarking and the biasing of executive pay,"The disclosure of compensation peer groups is argued to provide shareholders with valuable information that can be used to scrutinize CEO compensation. However, research suggests that there are substantial incentives for executives and directors to bias the compensation peer group upward such that the CEO can extract additional rent. We leverage the idea that reciprocated peer nominations are unlikely to be biased in order to construct counterfactual peer groups that allow us to measure the bias of disclosed peer groups. Analyses of eleven years of comprehensive data on compensation peer groups demonstrate that the average ﬁrm uses an upwardly biased peer group. The size of the bias increases when incentives and opportunities to do so are more pronounced. Speciﬁcally, results show that bias is larger when ﬁnancial targets are not met and when exercising discretion in the selection of peer ﬁrms is justiﬁable. More importantly, upward bias in compensation peer groups is highly predictive of an increase in CEO compensation – suggesting that there is a strong incentive for CEOs to strategically select peers. Finally, while average peer group bias has gone down in recent years, the predictive eﬀect of bias on pay has gone up. These ﬁndings call into question the practical impact of recent eﬀorts to introduce greater transparency into the process for determining executive compensation.",TRUE,FALSE,executive compensation|income inequality|peer benchmarking|social comparisons,2018-07-13T10:12:41.784699,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-13T09:48:24.789241,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/citation/,r3cha,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/97ebq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/relationships/node/,97ebq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b472f00d46a08000e277249/,5b472f00d46a08000e277249,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r3cha/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r3cha,https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3151

I read the book to see what I could learn about contemporary conservative thinking, especially anti-Trump conservatism. Opposing Trump and the movement he leads is suddenly the most pressing progressive issue of our time, and it’s important not to be too narrow in mobilizing that opposition.  Unfortunately, I found the book to be an extended screed against leftism with but a few pages of anti-Trump material grafted in here and there, which ultimately amounts to blaming leftism and immigration for Trump. And that might sum up the state of the anemic conservative movement. Goldberg’s own weak-kneed position on Trump is not resolved until page 316, when he finally concludes, “As much as I hold Trump in contempt, I am still compelled to admit that, if my vote would have decided the election, I probably would have voted for him” (316).

Using data from the 2010 Brazilian census and vital statistics from the Ministry of Health for 129 Brazilian cities, results reveal racial isolation is a strong predictor of Afro-Brazilian homicide rates, net of race-specific socioeconomic indicators and other contextual factors. Contrary to prior studies, however, this model shows racial evenness is not associated with Afro-Brazilian homicide rates. The findings also reveal that a higher percentage of Afro-Brazilian families headed by single mothers, low levels of education, and general income inequality are strong predictors of Afro-Brazilian homicides.

I use administrative data to examine differences in the social gradient in the primary admission system, admitting students on the basis of their high school grade point average, and in the secondary admission system, admitting university students based on more qualitative assessments. I find that the secondary higher education admission system does not favour first-generation students; further, the system serves as an access route for low-achieving children from the privileged professional classes.

Using Denmark as a case, we investigate changes in immobility patterns for cohorts born 1960–1981 and develop a new micro-educational classification capturing both hierarchical and horizontal forms of educational differentiation. To investigate the association between parents’ and children’s educational status, we apply log linear models and control for four types of educational immobility: gradational (by returns to education), aggregated (5 macro-educational levels), horizontal (19 fields of study), and disaggregated (62 micro-educations). Our findings show that while macro-educational immobility has decreased across the period, micro-educational immobility at the university and university college levels remains high and stable, in particular for sons. We also find great variation in immobility for specific micro-educations within the university level. Studies of educational immobility would therefore benefit from paying attention to micro-educational classifications, because they capture patterns of multidimensional, disaggregated forms of reproduction.

However, in a recent study, Landersø and Heckman (L &amp; H) (2017) argue that intergenerational educational mobility in Denmark and the United States is remarkably similar. L &amp; H’s findings run contrary to widespread beliefs and have been echoed in academia and mass media on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In this article, we reanalyze educational mobility in Denmark and the United States using the same data sources as L &amp; H. We apply several different methodological approaches from economics and sociology, and we consistently find that educational mobility is
higher in Denmark than in the United States.",TRUE,FALSE,comparative analyses of education systems|education and inequality|Intergenerational educational mobility,2018-07-13T10:36:05.835995,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-13T10:34:56.125677,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/citation/,9b6mu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5eypr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/relationships/node/,5eypr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b45f5dc4e95590013b192c8/,5b45f5dc4e95590013b192c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9b6mu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9b6mu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9b6mu,https://doi.org/10.15195/v5.a5

Such programs can facilitate greater integration of variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar power into the grid. However, load control programs are uncommon in the U.S., and it is unclear what factors are associated with consumer willingness to participate in such programs. We examine the effect of demographic characteristics and types of benefits on willingness to share static and dynamic load information with the utility and participate in a load control program. A U.S. general population survey experiment presented respondents with short descriptions of refrigerator information sharing or control, with varying descriptions of benefits (including cost incentives and environmental benefits). Willingness to participate was highest when environmental benefits were described and among younger respondents, with respondent age having the largest effect. Respondents were more willing to share static than dynamic load information. Willingness to share dynamic information and participate in load control were comparable. These results suggest that targeted communication strategies that leverage consumer preferences for environmental benefits along with individual demographic characteristics may be most effective in eliciting adoption of load control programs.",TRUE,FALSE,environmental attitudes|load control,2018-07-10T11:50:21.384095,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-10T11:50:01.797714,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/citation/,rpg46,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v3byf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/relationships/node/,v3byf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b43d5924e95590010b0d7ea/,5b43d5924e95590010b0d7ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rpg46/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rpg46/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rpg46,NA
