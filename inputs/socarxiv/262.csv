The problem is that the relativization of facts – the claim that knowledge is merely a product of power, history, and perspective – is a core aspect of present-day ideological thinking. Critical theories have been unable to respond to this challenge, because their critique has been directed against the opposite claim, namely, the naturalization of facts. While acknowledging this problem, this article argues that post-truth discourse actually combines relativization and naturalization. It does not simply relativize truth, but also naturalizes the belief in specific ‘facts’ – notably the belief that ‘conspiracies are behind it all’. Once we recognise the twin character of post-truth, we must reject the view of Bruno Latour and others who have made critique responsible for the crisis. Instead, it then becomes apparent that there are deep and disconcerting similarities between post-truth politics and the totalitarian and authoritarian ideologies of the 20th century. The task of critique is to confront and counter this resurgent ideology, thereby providing direction and orientation in the struggle for emancipation.",TRUE,FALSE,belief|conspiracy theories|courage|critical International Relations theory|critical IR theory|critical theory|critique|critique of ideology|cynicism|disbelief|emancipation|ideology|ideology critique|International Relations theory|IR theory|knowledge|naivety|naturalization|postmodernism|poststructuralism|post-truth|power|relativism|relativization|Trump|truth,2020-01-24T12:08:01.099763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T12:07:49.811584,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/citation/,5gxd2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2ad2c8c19c5d00d8edfd89/,5e2ad2c8c19c5d00d8edfd89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gxd2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5gxd2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5gxd2,NA

Participatory governance claims to ``deepen'' democracy by offering citizens opportunities to express policy preferences throughout the electoral cycle.
When citizen input derived from participatory governance initiatives is at odds with the orders of politicians in power, (i) do bureaucrats side with political principals as most political economy accounts would predict, (ii) do they shape policy as the bureau-shaping hypothesis proposes, (iii) or is their reaction much more ad-hoc and driven by behavioural biases as theories of representative democracy and behavioural public administration would predict?
This study assesses this using a survey experiment with bureaucrats with managerial responsibilities, employed in the UK and US public sector.
 It finds that when citizen input and demands of political principals are at logger-heads, bureaucrats behave in line with the bureau-shaping hypothesis - they will shape policy design according to their professional norms and values.

Analyses use 2014–2016 Demographic and Health Surveys, nationally representative surveys of women aged 15–49 years. Results show that maternal healthcare utilization is significantly higher among women exposed to mass media across countries, even after controlling for mother’s, husband’s, and household socioeconomic status. Women exposed to mass media are 39–113% more likely to receive antenatal care, 17–99% more likely to deliver their babies by skilled birth attendants, and 24–95% more likely to receive postpartum check-ups after their delivery across countries.

The now popular measure of occupational education following from Hauser and Warren (1997) suffer from slightly larger overlap with education; more of its intergenerational correlation is explained by parents’ education.

While there is already a growing body of research on specific aspects of platform governance (algorithms, content moderation, policies), there is still only little theoretical grounding of these debates in social theory. 

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a concept of platform governance based on institutional theory that understands governance as reflexive coordination, and thus different from regulation. Such a concept promises instructive insights into different forms of mediating communication and transactions by platforms. 

In the second part of the paper, we apply this concept to content moderation and regulation on Facebook. This empirical part is based on a study of the evolving policies and practices with regard to handling controversial content (nudity, hate speech, fake news) on the platform over a timeframe of 10 years.

Findings from previous research have shown that income inequality is positively associated with population change, but these studies have not explicitly tested for differences between the impacts of population growth and decline. Understanding the implications of population dynamics is particularly important given that many rural areas are characterized by population decline. We analyze county-level data (n=15,375 county-decades) from the Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS), applying fixed effects models to estimate the respective effects of population growth and decline on income inequality, to identify the processes that mediate the links between population change and inequality, and to assess whether these effects are moderated by county-level economic and demographic characteristics. We find evidence that population decline is associated with increased levels of income inequality relative to counties experiencing stable and high rates of population growth. This relationship remains robust across a variety of model specifications, including models that account for changes in counties’ employment, sociodemographic, and ethnoracial composition.

The regime has deliberately supported several armed non-state actors to achieve the goals, particularly as seen in its relations with Lebanese Hezbollah and Shia groups in Iraq, the IRGC has served as a node in providing a broad range of state support. Although the IRGC has the characteristics of conventional armed forces, its extraterritorial activities contradict the legal frame of ‘use of military force’ and mostly fit the characteristics of ‘state sponsorship of terrorism.’ Moreover, these activities challenge international norms and provoke other regional actors. This condition creates an obstacle to Iran’s integration into the international system which is increasingly globalized and interconnected and an environment which is costly to live within and leaves it isolated. These attitudes paradoxically place Iran in a situation that challenges the goals of ‘state security and survival’ and ‘becoming the regional power’ in the long run. Thus, it is argued that the real reason behind the regime’s insistence on this strategy is preserving the current political system and the power of current ruling elites; in brief, it is labeled ‘regime survival’ in this study.",TRUE,FALSE,Iran|IRGC|Near and Middle East|Quds Force|State Sponsorship of Terrorism|The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),2020-01-24T14:49:00.815854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T14:48:27.585041,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/citation/,nk9e3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2871a959684b007e6b94e9/,5e2871a959684b007e6b94e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk9e3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nk9e3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nk9e3,NA

These changes have been aligned with a restricted and rather uniform conceptualisation of what science is, and knowledge is made. However, knowledge-making is not a uniform affair. Here, we reflect on a salient fault line running through Wissenschaft (the whole of academic knowledge making, spanning the sciences and humanities), grounded in the relationship between the acts of research and writing, separating research as reporting from research as writing. We do so to demonstrate that replication and replicability cannot be treated as uniformly applicable and that assessment and improvement of research quality invites various tools and strategies. Among those, replication is important, but not omnipresent. Considering these other tools and strategies in context allows us to situate the value of replication for knowledge making as a whole.",TRUE,FALSE,epistemic pluralism|replicability|replication|research|writing,2020-01-22T14:42:44.339096,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-22T14:42:23.510414,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/citation/,9j74n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y5pvu/,y5pvu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e28216a59684b00496bae3c/,5e28216a59684b00496bae3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9j74n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9j74n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9j74n,https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2020.1720659
