We test whether local place character—the cultural reputations, values, and ideals associated with a particular location—predict support for feminism expressed on Twitter. Applying topic modeling to a unique corpus describing cities’ cultural reputations, we identify five cultural attributes of U.S. cities that constitute their place character. Then, we use these measures to predict the percentage of tweets that are positive toward feminism in each location. The results indicate that while social media may connect people from geographically distant areas, online discourse is still heavily influenced by the local spaces where users reside. Cities with a place character of Revitalization have more positive Twitter sentiment toward feminism, while areas known as Local Hubs for shopping and leisure are more negative. These findings contribute to social movement scholarship by highlighting one way that offline and online contexts are connected.

Against this skepticism, we underline that culture is always a collective phenomenon, commonly understood as the prevalent values in a population that form its mentality and identity in differentiation from others. Nations are population entities that are manifest in states as their organizational frame, in countries as their territorial space, and in national identity as their psychological glue. Territorial in character, nations form spatial fields of ‘cultural gravitation.’ Above and beneath nations, other spatial fields of cultural gravitation exist, like sub-national regions (beneath) and geo-political areas (above). There are also non-spatial forces of cultural gravitation, including language, ethnicity, religion, social class, gender, and generation. To operationalize nations as gravitational fields of culture, we look at them in terms of their central tendencies and these tendencies’ densities and variance-binding powers, rather than understanding nations as monolithic and closed cultural containers. Because national culture is foundational for societal institutions and guides individuals’ behavior, it is of intrinsic interest for the social sciences to study culture at the nation-level, even in the presence of internal heterogeneity and cross-border similarity. Whenever of interest, sub- and supra-national cultural groups as well as non-spatial cultural groups should also be studied, but our theoretical framework warrants the use of nations as meaningful gravitational units for analyzing the dimensions and dynamics of culture.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural homogeneity|culture|identity|nation|units of analysis,2021-02-24T09:47:32.363498,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-24T09:46:58.665432,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/citation/,94msk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603614e44ad52e05fd6e1a58/,603614e44ad52e05fd6e1a58,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/94msk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/94msk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/94msk

They will lead to long-term sex imbalances in more than a third of the world’s population with yet unknown social and economic impacts on affected countries. Understanding the potential evolution of sex imbalances at birth is therefore essential for anticipating and planning for changing sex structures across the world. 

Methods: We produced probabilistic SRB projections from 2018 to 2100 based on different scenarios of sex ratio transition and assessed their implications in terms of missing female births at global, regional, and national levels. Based on a comprehensive SRB database, we project the skewed SRB and missing female births with a Bayesian hierarchical time series mixture model. The SRB projections under reference scenario S1 assumed SRB transitions only for countries with strong statistical evidence of SRB inflation, and the more extreme scenario S2 assumed a sex ratio transition for countries at risk of SRB inflation but with no or limited evidence of ongoing inflation.

Results: Under scenario S1, we projected 8.1 (95% uncertainty interval [2.3; 19.6]) million additional missing female births to occur by 2100. Countries affected will be those already affected in the past by imbalanced SRB, such as China and India. If all countries at risk of SRB inflation experience a sex ratio transition as in scenario S2, the projected missing female births increase to 24.8 [13.1; 44.1] million with a sizeable contribution of sub-Saharan Africa.

Conclusion: The scenario-based projections provide important illustrations of the potential burden of future prenatal sex discrimination and the need to monitor SRBs in countries with son preference. Policy planning will be needed in the years to come to minimize future prenatal sex discrimination and its impact on social structures.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian hierarchical model|global health|missing female births|probabilistic projection|scenario-based projection|sex ratio at birth|sex-selective abortion,2021-02-25T03:47:37.611424,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T03:36:39.386127,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12764249,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/citation/,zps2m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6036089a34d3040621e39e13/,6036089a34d3040621e39e13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zps2m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zps2m/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zps2m

This empirical principle has been confirmed for various dimensions---cities, regions, and countries---and their activities--- developing new technologies, products, and industries. However, the technological diversification of firms is yet unexplored. Is a firm more successful at entering a new technology when it has already accumulated related technologies? Here, we explore this issue using a unique dataset that contains firms' patent data and financial and market information. In particular, we examine Korean firms listed in the Korean stock market that published patents at the patent offices in Korea, Europe, and the United States from 1984 to 2004. We develop a technological relatedness measure to estimate whether a firm has already published patents with similar technologies. We find that firms are more likely to develop a new technology when they already have related technologies. Interestingly, technological relatedness shows an increasing return to related knowledge. We also check the robustness of this effect using propensity score matching and find that the effects of technological relatedness and its increasing return behavior remain significant when controlling for potential confounding effects. These findings extend the concept of relatedness to a firm's technological diversification and show that the development of a firm's technological knowledge is shaped by its technological relatedness.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-25T03:48:01.774488,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T03:37:14.939335,FALSE,NA,no,Other researchers can buy PATSTATS data.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Seung Hwan Kim,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/citation/,47ank,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6035df5e88ea1a058cee9c2f/,6035df5e88ea1a058cee9c2f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/47ank/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/47ank/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/47ank

Critics argue that sanctions may be ineffective in bringing people back to employment or indeed harmful in a range of ways. Existing reviews largely assess the labour market impacts of sanctions but our understanding of the wider impacts is more limited. We report results from a scoping review of the international quantitative research evidence on both labour market and wider impacts of benefit sanctions. Following systematic search and screening, we extract data for 94 studies reporting on 253 outcome measures. We provide a narrative summary, paying attention to the ability of the studies to support causal inference. Despite variation in the evidence base and study designs, we found that labour market studies, covering two thirds of our sample, consistently reported positive impacts for employment but negative impacts for job quality and stability in the longer term, along with increased transitions to non-employment or economic inactivity.

A comparison of three types of engagement using data from the General Social Survey,"Engaging in the arts is a health-related behavior that may be influenced by social inequalities. While it is generally accepted that there is a social gradient in arts participation, previous studies of arts engagement in the US have not used comprehensive measures of engagement and often focus on single demographic or socioeconomic predictors of engagement rather than simultaneously testing a range of factors that may be related to one another. Using cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (GSS) in the US, we examined which demographic, socioeconomic, residential, and health factors were associated with attendance at arts events, participation in arts activities, and membership of creative groups. We combined data from 1993 to 2016 in three analytical samples with a sample size of 8,684 for arts events, 4,372 for arts activities, and 4,268 for creative groups. Data were analysed using logistic regression. More education was associated with increased levels of all types of arts engagement. Parental education demonstrated a similar association. Being female, compared to male, was also consistently associated with higher levels of engagement. Attendance at arts events was lower in participants with lower income and social class, poorer health, and those living in less urban areas. However, these factors were not associated with engagement in arts activities or creative groups. Overall, we found evidence for a social gradient in attendance at arts events, which was not as pronounced in engagement in arts activities or creative groups. Given the many benefits of engagement in the arts for education, health, and wider welfare, our findings demonstrate the importance of identifying factors to reduce barriers to participation in the arts across all groups in society.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-25T13:21:11.991403,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T13:19:58.758483,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/citation/,5nyq3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pe7wz/,pe7wz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603538d44ad52e04f06e75a3/,603538d44ad52e04f06e75a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nyq3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5nyq3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5nyq3

It focuses on analyzing the professional development plans that were delivered to teachers for four core subjects in elementary and middle public schools. A mixed-method approach was employed, using quantitative one-way ANOVA and in-depth interviews and school visits to collect and analyze data. The results revealed that stakeholders and education leaders lacked clarity of purpose with respect to planning for professional development and did not rely on a cohesive framework for training teachers, resulting in discrepancies among all training plans. The study concludes with recommendations for the adaptation of a national framework for professional development based on educational theory and teachers’ needs.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-02-25T13:19:42.060252,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T13:19:16.849915,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/citation/,zsg3h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6034950934d30404bfe3bbbe/,6034950934d30404bfe3bbbe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsg3h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zsg3h/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.01.178,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zsg3h
