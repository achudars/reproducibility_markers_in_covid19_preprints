The convenience and interactivity of its usage encourage people to turn to it in the educational process rather often while teaching or studying unfamiliar topics. Hypertext resources of different kinds have become a virtual educational environment. They offer new opportunities for structuring, presenting, adapting, and integrating contemporary learning materials. Besides, hypermedia technologies have made a considerable breakthrough in the educational process, particularly in self-education, combining hitherto incompatible elements. The article focuses on practical experience in the introduction of hypertext in the educational process of higher education institutions in general and during pandemic periods, in particular, the world faces nowadays. In the course of the research, it was emphasized that such technologies are pretty significant in implementing distance learning. Hypermedia technologies create especially suitable conditions for the independent acquisition and quality assimilation of the necessary information, which can be easily integrated into the educational process. The provided analysis of the implementation of e-learning materials based on hypertext and multimedia tools made it possible to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the described technologies (compared to traditional usage of printed textbooks), thus identifying their didactic potential.

However, with the spread of Covid 19, Algerian universities have been compelled to undertake remote and digital teaching. The University of Dr. MoulayTahar in Saida has arbitrarily hastened in implementing E-learning as an alternative teaching measure to maintain both positive educational outcomes and keep students safe and healthy. This research purports to examine how the University of Dr. MoulayTahar in Saida has used Moodle platform to facilitate the teaching process during the Covid 19. This paper, therefore, stresses the issues of distance e-learning that challenge both teachers and students alike. The researchers attempt to answer the following question: What are the affective attitudes of EFL students towards distance learning assisted with Moodle Platform during the Coronavirus? To supply an adequate answer to the raised question, the researchers have selected a sample of 157 participants. The researchers collected data through a questionnaire and delivered copies to the participants. The findings revealed that both the teachers and the learners were not well prepared for an online learning experience. That there are more disadvantages than advantages. The results of the research conveyed that the technical skills, the teachers’ lack of experience as well as the social situation of the students have made E. learning a complex process. The analysis also revealed that Master students have negative attitudes towards e-learning, and they would prefer face-to-face interaction in the classroom and handouts more than virtual learning.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19 pandemic|distance – learning|Dr. MoulayTahar University|EFL students’ attitudes|e-learning|Moodle platform,2021-05-20T15:01:06.596417,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T15:00:11.156202,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/citation/,4xepz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5db768b826b01458be560/,60a5db768b826b01458be560,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xepz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4xepz/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4xepz

Specifically, the study attempts to find out whether universities are prepared for online assessment during the lockdown and to probe feasible solutions to the challenges that hinder proper assessment in a virtual learning environment (VLE). As the challenges are determined, the study suggests a number of practical solutions. Data on faculty’s observations were obtained by means of an online survey. Eighty-three faculty members participated in this study. The findings showed that universities swiftly shifted to e-classes during the lockdown but that they were not adequately primed for an appropriate assessment in an online environment. The findings further showed that instructors were skeptical about the efficiency of remote assessment of their students. In addition, faculty members believed there was still a long way to go with regards to (1) the unavailability of reliable software to preclude academic dishonesty; (2) some faculty being unable to assess their students in VLE as it was their first experience; and (3) formative assessment not having been given enough attention. It is concluded that universities should have an exigency strategy for any sudden future lockdowns. This strategy includes, among other things, intensive e-teaching and e-testing training for faculty, high-tech invigilation and plagiarism software, reliable e-learning platforms with sufficient Internet bandwidth, setting up an e-assessment council at the university level.",TRUE,FALSE,challenges and solutions|COVID-19|e-assessment|e-test|Jordan|Princess Sumaya University for Technology|remote assessment,2021-05-20T15:01:05.076257,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T15:00:25.710146,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/citation/,s3n68,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5da82e2a9800159a649e0/,60a5da82e2a9800159a649e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3n68/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s3n68/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s3n68

One of the approaches the teachers can benefit from significantly is instructional modal – the Sheltered Instructional Observational Protocol (SIOP). This study aims to determine the effectiveness of SIOP instructional strategies in this digital teaching of EFL students. The study was conducted at the undergraduate level for English language learners in the Faculty of Philology, V.O. Sukhomlynskyi National University of Mykolaiv, Ukraine. The researchers conducted the study in the first semester of 2020. The contribution of this study is to evaluate experience of teachers in instructional strategies and to assess their effectiveness in digital teaching. The study analyzes the responses of twenty-five teachers and 63 students to the SIOP-based survey. A descriptive statistical method was used to test the validation. The results of the recearch show that EFL learners are not satisfied with activities to apply language and content knowledge. The results justified that teachers need to establish active online communication with their students. The study presents some recommendations for EFL teachers to improve their professional skills by adopting the specific components of SIOP and mastering their instructional strategies in digital learning.

Aggregate relational data are collected by asking questions about respondents' connectedness to many different groups  (e.g., ""How many teachers do you know?""). This approach can be powerful but, to make use of aggregate relational data, researchers must locate external information about the size of each of these groups from a census or from administrative records (e.g., the number of teachers in the population). This need for external information makes aggregate relational data  difficult or impossible to collect in many settings. Here, we show that relatively simple modifications can overcome this need for external data, significantly increasing the flexibility of the method and weakening key assumptions required by the associated estimators. Our methods are appropriate for using a sample survey to study the size and distribution of weak-tie network connections.

Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire to demonstrate a need for comprehensive management guidelines for individuals with PD regarding social communication skills. This questionnaire will highlight the areas of deficit for the individuals with PD. 
Methods: Fifty-one people with self-reported Parkinson’s Disease answered 28 survey questions. These questions pertained to emotional expression and perception, social communication, sarcasm/humor, and pragmatic skills. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis were performed to identify which items loaded onto the desired factor and to check the internal consistency of the items. 
Results: Persons with PD reported changes in emotional expression and perception, social communication, sarcasm and humor, and pragmatic skills domains post PD diagnosis. No correlations were found between age/time since diagnosis and emotional expression, social communication, sarcasm, and humor.

In model specification, control variables serve as an important tool for ensuring that the estimate of a relationship between X and Y is properly specified. However, control variables have often been uncritically included and potentially misspecified in observational social science, risking several types of bias. Using the journal Demography as a window into the discipline, we reviewed the use of control variables in statistical models published in the journal from 1995 to 2020. Results show that control variables are usually under-explained, making it difficult to evaluate their quality.

Perspektiven Tiroler Expert/innen auf den Übergang von der Pflichtschule in den Arbeitsmarkt.,"Die vergleichende europäische Jugendforschung verweist auf einen Trend zur Individualisierung jugendlicher Übergangsverläufe. Vor dem Hintergrund sozialen Wandels vollzieht sich der Übergang in die Arbeitswelt heute immer weniger linear. Andere Teilübergänge (z.B. Haushalt, Partnerschaft) zeigen ein ähnliches Muster und bilden in der Zusammenschau mit Arbeit den Übergang ins Erwachsenenalter.  Hiervon ausgehend plädieren Forschungsarbeiten zunehmend für einen stärker individualisierten Zugang in der institutionellen Übergangsarbeit, um den individuellen und subjektiven Bedürfnissen der Jugendlichen bei der Aushandlung des Übergangs besser gerecht werden zu können. Ausgehend von dieser Perspektive auf jugendliche Übergänge wurden 21 Personen interviewt, welche im Arbeitsfeld ‚Übergang Schule - Arbeit‘ professionell in Tirol tätig sind. Der institutionelle Hintergrund der Interviewpartner/innen reicht von der Schule über die Jugendarbeit und über Arbeitsmarktinstitutionen bis hin zu privaten Unternehmen, welche Jugendliche beschäftigen und ausbilden. Die Ergebnisse verweisen auf einen subjektorientierten Zugang von Übergangsprofessionellen in ihrer täglichen Arbeit. Ein solcher nimmt die Bedürfnisse junger Frauen und Männer unter den  Bedingungen gesellschaftlicher Individualisierung ernst und reflektiert die Notwendigkeit, Kompetenzen der Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen für die individuelle Aushandlung des eigenen Lebens zu stärken. Ein solch professionelles Handeln korrespondiert in unterschiedlichem Maße mit dem institutionellen Hintergrund der Befragten. Hieraus ergibt sich ein Spannungsfeld zwischen jugendlichen Bedürfnissen, den professionellen Ansprüchen der Befragten und dem institutionellen Rahmen, in dem sich Übergangsarbeit vollzieht. Ein Konflikt besteht zwischen den anerkannten Bedürfnissen der Jugendlichen, eine intrinsische Motivation zu entwickeln, sowie nach Teilhabe an der eigenen Übergangsgestaltung einerseits und der Realität begrenzter Ressourcen sowie einem wahrgenommen
Fehlen entsprechender politische Maßnahmen andererseits.",TRUE,FALSE,Austria|School to Work Transitions|Tyrol|Youth Studies|Youth Transitions|Youth Unemployment,2021-05-19T20:22:44.781786,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-19T20:22:21.375406,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/citation/,e7nk8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/de4xb/,de4xb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a4ca58e2a98000fba6330d/,60a4ca58e2a98000fba6330d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7nk8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e7nk8/,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4709128,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e7nk8
