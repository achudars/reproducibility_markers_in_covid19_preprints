In Morphology of the Folktale, Vladimir Propp argues against the separation of ""who acts"" from ""the question of the actions themselves,"" instead advocating an approach that studies characters according to their functions. Similarly, the notion of the literary archetype, as influenced by both Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, highlights the way in which what characters do influences the way we perceive who characters are. The notion of literary stereotypes is also tied to this discussion. As Bamman, O'Connor, and Smith observe in their study of personas in film, stereotypical characters are ""defined by a fixed set of actions widely known to be representative of a class."" While actions are only one part of a complex network of descriptive tools that authors may use to create characters, they may offer us a useful insight into the way that certain behaviors can align with various character identity traits in literature.  A study of character action may serve as a proxy to not only demarcate character types, but also to investigate what behaviors, and types of behaviors, were conventionally aligned with different groups of characters. Bamman, Underwood, and Smith (2014) attempt something similar in ""A Bayesian Mixed Effects Model of Literary Character."" In that work, the authors focus on modeling specific character ""personas"" by studying semantically related words that occur in proximity to character mentions.  The authors note that ""articulating what a true 'persona' might be for characters is inherently problematic"" and they acknowledge that the ""personas learned so far [by their model] do not align neatly with character types known to literary historians."" Nevertheless, their study revealed compelling associations between certain personas and certain genres and, more importantly for our current research, that certain personas were ""clearly gendered."" In noting the later, the authors write that ""analysis of latent character types might cast new light on the history of gender in fiction."" Our work attempts a more direct and specific study of character agency in the context of character gender.  To do this, we explore trends in behavior associated with male and female characters in 3,329 19th century novels.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-04T01:26:41.078467,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-04T01:26:23.580227,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/citation/,sw85m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/av7g4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/relationships/node/,av7g4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b64d3897e433e0016038685/,5b64d3897e433e0016038685,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw85m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sw85m/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.010,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sw85m

China, and analyzes the structural conditions that are associated with couples' proximity to the husband's and the wife's parents.
Background: Patrilocality is a core aspect of the traditional Chinese kinship system,
and is deeply rooted in Confucian beliefs. In recent decades, however, this custom has been challenged by internal migration as well changes in family values and preferences.
Method: We model the effect of each spouse's household registration (hukou) origin, education level, and sibling structure on intergenerational proximity, using a nationally representative sample of 4,256 couples derived from the 2010 China Family Panel Studies.
Results: Almost 75% of married Chinese couples live with or in close proximity to
the husband's parents. There is, however, a strong social gradient in intergenerational proximity, and patrilocality is particularly pronounced among rural-origin and less educated couples. Matrilocal residence remains unusual, although it is more likely when the wife has no brothers.
Conclusion: The custom of patrilocal residence demonstrates a remarkable resilience, even as other patriarchal traditions have crumbled in the face of China's 'Great Transformation'.
Implications: We provide explanations for the persistence of patrilocality and discuss implications for intergenerational support, gender inequality and son preference.",TRUE,FALSE,China|China Family Panel Studies|Coresidence|Gender|Intergenerational Relations|Matrilocality|Patrilocality|Proximity,2018-08-03T10:47:25.126345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-03T10:46:43.712705,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/citation/,xzqbe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d2gms/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/relationships/node/,d2gms,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6422f3aeba2d001014e23f/,5b6422f3aeba2d001014e23f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzqbe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xzqbe/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xzqbe

Electric vehicles need electricity as fuel, so the charging facilities are becoming an important infrastructure. Up to now, the US has about 120,000 gas stations while charging stations are only 10,000. Unfortunately, most of them are slow charging piles, like Level 1 or 2.

How a user engages can be divided up into many sub sections, but in its simplest notion it’s how a person interacts with the content that is presented to them. Engagement is also a sing that a person has payed attention to what is being presented to them.
YouTube was created by former PayPal employees Steve Chen, Jawed Karim and Chad Hurley in 2005, and today with 1 billion monthly active users, it is the most used social networking and video sharing platform on the internet. YouTube also has a powerful effect in that it enables people to spread content effortlessly and freely to a wide and open audience. Understanding the incredible power of YouTube can be highlighted by examples such as Justin Bieber who rocketed to international stardom and fame via the platform, or how the world stopped and focused on Kony in 2012. Much of this success and popularity of the website has been explained by the fact that users are able to communicate “through textual and video responses as well as video rating systems” (Milliken, Gibson, O’Donnell &amp; Singer 2008).
This research paper serves to make important contributions to topics of viral marketing and engagement behaviours of users on YouTube. This is important when considering the popularity of YouTube and the numbers of users actively engaging in content, especially for business and individuals who use YouTube as their source of income. Research on various microblogging platforms has revealed “that microblogs can be tailored to facilitate informal communication between colleagues in organizations”, (Suh, Hong, Pirolli, &amp; Chi, 2010) but there is little research that explores video blogging communities on YouTube. This research paper will explore how tags and the length of videos impact user engagement in the Motor Vlogging community.
In section 2, a general overview of related in relevant research is presented, followed by the research question and hypothesis in section 3 which explores the relationship between social engagement on YouTube Motor Vlogger videos from Australia and how the presence of tags and the length of the videos impact on the levels of engagement.

We then describe intervention processes that have been successful in bringing the ratio of women close to parity, compare different minorities in the US, and also consider data from India, Western and Eastern Europe. We conjecture that programs that connect the different levels of education are needed in addition to hiring more women, providing them with basic human rights from when they begin their PhD onwards and promoting support networks for existing employees.

This was because business donors were overwhelmingly concerned with the left-right dimension and enjoyed stable relationships with centre-right parties.  These parties are increasingly tempted by nationalist positions on a globalisation dimension.  This new ideological flux provides an opportunity to measure the extent to which donors are party identifiers or react to changes in the policy space. Dramatic shifts in party policy on both dimensions and a relatively transparent political finance regime make the UK a particularly apposite case to study this question. I analyse 19,000 donations to the Conservative Party and show that business donors reacted strongly to recent shifts on both the left-right and globalisation dimensions.  Thus, centre-right parties cannot rely on party identification and their left-right position to maintain business funding.  Economic nationalism costs centre-right parties money.",TRUE,FALSE,Brexit|business and politics|Conservative Party|policy space|political finance|political parties,2018-08-02T13:43:41.049155,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-02T13:42:09.241703,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,None,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/citation/,4svrx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r8ecz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/relationships/node/,r8ecz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b62c7d5dedf030012c106ae/,5b62c7d5dedf030012c106ae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4svrx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4svrx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4svrx
