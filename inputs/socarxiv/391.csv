A variety of professional development strategies have been introduced to teachers of English and have been put into practice. Action research is one of these strategies. It is introduced to teachers through a voluntary course, Research for Professional Development (RPD), which is a sixteen-session course and lasts for one semester. This course aims to raise teachers' knowledge and skills of action research in order to support them, as research practitioners, to enhance the quality of their work and to show initiatives in their schools. However, as it is relatively new in this context, this study attempted to explore teachers' beliefs on the values of this course with regard to their professional development and the extent to which these teachers adopted this strategy for their ongoing professional development after the course. The study was conducted in the Dakhiliya region of Oman and the data was collected from eight teachers through a semi-structured interview. The findings indicate a conception of the RPD course as a means to enrich Omani teachers' knowledge and skills of AR. The practical side of the course also raises participants' awareness of the possibilities of improving their work and gives them insights to solving their students' problems through systematic inquiries. This study also reveals that, although participants master this tool, very few of them conduct action research after the course and this is due to the lack of time, heavy responsibilities and lack of support. Therefore, this study raises the issue that although providing teachers with knowledge and skills of PD strategies is essential, enabling them to apply these strategies relies heavily on paying attention to their needs.",TRUE,FALSE,Action research|research for professional development course|teachers’ professional development,2019-09-11T12:49:46.891957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-11T12:49:21.074374,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/citation/,4gynu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d77e395af02530019a62d1e/,5d77e395af02530019a62d1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4gynu/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.237,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4gynu

The sample of this study consisted of 151 randomly-selected female students enrolled in the department of English at the College of Languages and Translation at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University in the academic year 1436/1437– 2015/2016 in the first semester. The researcher used both a five-point Likert scale questionnaire as a quantitative instrument and semi-structured interviews with
students as a qualitative instrument to collect the data of the study. Those instruments were validated by ten university professors. Similarly, the reliability of the questionnaire was achieved by calculating Cronbach Alpha formula. The findings of the study revealed that the most important benefits of using Instagram in learning English were as follows: improving the reading, writing, and listening skills, providing enjoyable learning experiences, enriching vocabulary, improving oral communication skills, and enjoying a sense of freedom of time and place. Furthermore, the results of the study unveiled the following challenges of using Instagram in English learning: distracting attention, lack of direction from the syllabuses, lack of encouragement from instructors, embarrassment, lack of immediate feedback, the cost of Internet access, and the difficulty of writing long passages.

Drawing on more recent data, we reassess these trends and discover a striking increase in the ideological organization of American public opinion in the beginning of the 21st century. Using a broad set of issues from the American National Election Studies, we identify rapid growth in the correlations between political attitudes from 2004 to 2016. This emergence of issue alignment is most pronounced within the economic and civil rights domains, challenging the notion that current ""culture wars"" are grounded in moral issues. While elite subpopulations show the greatest gains, we find that economic issues become more highly correlated across the electorate. We also find accelerated growth in the association between issue attitudes and partisanship during this period.

In supporting this, there is a need to establish a decision-making and management system that involves the views and opinions of different stakeholders and unifies the goals of SIA amongst them. The objective of this work is to identify and describe pathways toward farm-level SIA. An explanatory network approach and fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) support the analysis of stakeholder views across the three pillars of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. Different stakeholder groups were asked to collectively map the pathways towards farm level SIA in a workshop exercise. The respective groups considered a common set of pre-selected factors as potential descriptors of sustainability and created unique maps by adding their own components and descriptors and identifying causal links between them. While the relative weighting of factors by each group differed, according to their perspectives and interpretation, yield, knowledge transfer, water quality, weather extremes and technology/infrastructure were scored as priority descriptors of farm-level sustainability by all groups in an aggregate analysis. Exploratory analysis of FCMs was found to provide an efficient mechanism to investigate stakeholder views on pathways towards farm-level SIA, by identifying causal relationships and interactions between factors and actors that affect its achievement. The study shows that sustainable intensification is a complex dynamic system that includes institutional structures, personal goals, stakeholder interests and socio-economic factors, and is affected by cognitive beliefs and particular knowledge within stakeholder groups. Our results show how experience, knowledge and beliefs affect the perception of farm-level SIA by various stakeholder groups, and how this knowledge is often fragmented and miscommunicated. The exercise confirmed the hypothesis that farm-level SIA has to be seen as a dynamic process in which farm performance is affected by various factors, with the complexity of the process increasing when different stakeholder interests and beliefs combine for farm management.",TRUE,FALSE,fuzzy cognitive mapping|group thinking|mental models|network analysis|stakeholder engagement|sustainable intensification,2019-09-10T15:19:23.493077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-10T15:18:55.764531,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,Evgenia Micha|Owen Fenton|Karen Daly|Gabriella Kakonyi|Golnaz Ezatti|Thomas Moloney|Steven F.

Working with civil society organizations, we designed the study to estimate how voters and candidates responded to their campaign in treatment and spillover villages, and how impacts varied with campaign intensity. Despite its heavy footprint, the campaign did not reduce politician offers of gifts in exchange for votes. However, it had sizable effects on people’s votes. Votes swung from well-funded incumbents (who buy most votes) towards their poorly-financed challengers. We argue the swing arose from changes in village social norms plus the tactical response of candidates.

In contrast to clinical drug trials, sample size calculations have rarely been carried out by experimental economists.

Here, in a study of the Mentawai water spirit Sikameinan (Siberut Island, Indonesia), we address three questions: (1) Are smaller gods believed to enforce cooperation, especially compared to bigger gods in larger-scale societies? (2) Do beliefs in these deities encourage people to engage in behavior that would otherwise be perceived as costly? and (3) Does ritual reinforce beliefs in these deities? Drawing on interview responses, data from healing ceremonies, and ethnographic observation, we show that Sikameinan is believed to punish people who violate meat-sharing norms and that people ‘attacked’ by Sikameinan pay shamans to conduct healing rituals. The public nature of rituals, involving prestigious individuals apologizing to Sikameinan for the patient’s stinginess, reinforce onlookers’ beliefs about Sikameinan. The most widely shared beliefs about Sikameinan are represented in rituals while beliefs not represented vary considerably, indicating that ritual may be potent for cultural transmission. These results suggest that moralizing supernatural punishers may be more common than suspected and that the trend in the cultural evolution of religion has been an expansion of deities’ scope, powers, and monitoring abilities.",TRUE,FALSE,animism|belief|cooperation|religion|ritual|shamanism,2019-09-09T17:17:01.861599,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-09T17:16:49.230186,NA,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/bjq6f/,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb2|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Other Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/citation/,npkdy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bjq6f/,bjq6f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7669f734e7c20019412255/,5d7669f734e7c20019412255,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npkdy/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npkdy

We show that any theory of crime in fact can define two related ideas about the victim, here called ideas of victimization and vulnerability, fixing their meaning and producing a constellation of testable predictions about their empirical properties. We then conduct a theoretical exercise contrasting how the internal logic of substantive positivist theories and choice theories would specify these ideas. We found that substantive positivism is not only the probable source of the aforementioned intellectual orthodoxy, but it also generates predictions about victimization and vulnerability that are inconsistent with the known facts. Choice theories, in contrast, incentivize scholars to attend to the victim and are able to make predictions that not only are consistent with known facts but that also suggest rich possibilities for the future growth of theory and research. Consideration of these ideas have important implications for falsifying longstanding criminological perspectives, by casting doubt on any crime theory that is unable to make believable empirical predictions about victimization and vulnerability.",TRUE,FALSE,criminological theory|criminology,2019-09-10T03:29:03.641415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-10T03:28:51.502262,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",None,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/citation/,6w8v7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7663cbd7413a0017622220/,5d7663cbd7413a0017622220,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6w8v7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6w8v7

The literature shows that phenotype has statistically significant effects on educational attainment, wages, job prestige, and other life outcomes; further those with more European phenotypes generally have more favorable life outcomes. These differences are obscured when Latino is used as a unit of analysis, suggesting that Latino is not a viable unit of analysis. Using Latino as a unit of analysis serves to misallocate resources intended to benefit victims of racial discrimination to Latinos with European phenotypes, as well as hiding the impact of discrimination on those with African or Amerindian phenotypes. The origin of Latino as a political term that attempted to distance and at the same time bring its members closer to whiteness makes its failure as a scientific tool unsurprising. Further research is needed on the impact of phenotype, and other areas of heterogeneity such as culture, religion, and language.",TRUE,FALSE,Chicano|Colorism|Discrimination|Ethnicity|Hispanic|History|Latino|Latinx|Phenotype|Race|Racism|Sociology,2019-09-09T02:47:06.830951,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-09T02:46:48.937045,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/citation/,jxs3w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d75a6bf34e7c2001a4174c2/,5d75a6bf34e7c2001a4174c2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxs3w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jxs3w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jxs3w
