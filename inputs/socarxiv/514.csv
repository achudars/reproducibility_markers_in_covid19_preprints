The Persistence and Convergence of Premigration Socioeconomic Status During the Age of Mass Migration,"A long-standing debate is concerned over how long premigration socioeconomic differences persisted for immigrants and their descendants who entered at the turn-of-the-twentieth century. Some researchers argue that differences exist today, over 100 years after first arrival, while others argue that most differences disappeared after the third generation. However, none of this research has directly measured pre-migration socioeconomic status nor has it directly linked immigrants to their children. I create a new panel dataset that follows immigrants and their children from the sending country through settlement. Specifically, I link ship manifest records to census records to track how long premigration socioeconomic differences persist across generations. Passenger records provide a wealth of information of individuals including the occupation before arrival. I analyze how long premigration differences persist within and between groups. Whereas premigration socioeconomic status is associated with the first generation’s economic outcomes after settlement, many of these differences disappear by the second generation. These results suggest that background is not destiny for immigrant descendants. As scholars and politicians debate about whether countries should admit primarily high-skilled or low-skilled immigrants, the results from this article tell us whether such selection policies are necessary to ensure strong migrants’ performance in a period of open borders.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-04T14:06:41.243453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-04T14:06:18.200980,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Peter Catron,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/citation/,gcx3a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/962xw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/relationships/node/,962xw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c05d9c165e965001addb50b/,5c05d9c165e965001addb50b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcx3a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gcx3a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gcx3a,NA

I show how transnational organizations promoted media content laden with global scripts denouncing violence against women, while foreign media entertainment organizations spread and inspired content that normalized violence.

These claims have greatly influenced debates regarding social policy, work, family, and gender inequality. Motivated by limitations of prior research, we analyze the relationship between the two most prominent work-family reconciliation policies (paid parental leave and public childcare coverage) and seven labor market outcomes (employment, full-time employment, earnings, full-time earnings, being a manager, being a lucrative manager, and occupation percent female). We estimate multi-level models of individuals nested in a cross-section of 21 rich democracies near 2005, and two-way fixed effects models of individuals nested in a panel of 12 rich democracies over time. The vast majority of coefficients for work-family policies fail to reject the null hypothesis of no effects. The pattern of insignificance occurs regardless of which set of models or coefficients one compares. Moreover, there is as much evidence that significantly contradicts the “tradeoff hypothesis” as is consistent with the hypothesis. Altogether, the analyses undermine claims that work-family reconciliation policies trigger tradeoffs and paradoxes in terms of gender equality with adverse labor market consequences for women.",TRUE,FALSE,family|inequality|labor markets|social policy|welfare state|work,2018-12-03T19:14:25.652944,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-03T19:13:54.664019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy",Brady|Blome &amp; Kmec,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/citation/,sbyz9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hgjny/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/relationships/node/,hgjny,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c05728225c61300175c0cf4/,5c05728225c61300175c0cf4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbyz9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbyz9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sbyz9,NA

An analysis accounting for reverse causality,"The unemployed are often in poorer health than their employed counterparts. This cross-sectional correlation is often attributed to a causal effect of unemployment on health. Resent research analyzing longitudinal data, however, often supports alternative explanations, such as spurious correlation and/or selection of unhealthy workers into unemployment (i.e., reverse causality). In this paper, we apply a dynamic panel data estimator (system GMM) to account for both unobserved confounders and reverse causality. Despite some evidence for health selection, we still find strong support for the causality thesis.

317 tenth and eleventh grade students (163 Arab-Palestinian students including 93 girls and 70 boys; and 154 Jewish students including 70 girls and 84 boys) participated in the study. The research was conducted in two state Arab-Palestinian schools, one state secular-Jewish school, and one state religious-Jewish school.
The research employed a series of questionnaires. First, a background questionnaire was used to collect basic data about the students; a second questionnaire assessed the nationalistic and religious socialization of the Jewish teenagers and the nationalistic, religious, and ethnic socialization of the Arab-Palestinian adolescents; a third questionnaire assessed the salience of national and religious identity among the Jewish participants, and the salience of national, religious, and ethnic identity among the Arab-Palestinian participants; a fourth questionnaire examined indices of psychological resilience, namely self-esteem, self-efficacy, and the sense of well-being of the Arab-Palestinian and Jewish students. 
The research findings indicate differences between the socialization processes experienced by the Arab-Palestinian students and those experienced by the Jewish students. The nationalistic socialization experienced by the Jewish adolescents was stronger than that experienced by the Arab-Palestinian adolescents, while the Arab-Palestinian adolescents experienced stronger religious socialization than that experienced by the Jewish adolescents. In addition, the level of religious identity was higher among the Arab-Palestinian participants than among the Jewish participants. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding salience of national identity. The findings did not indicate differences between the two groups with regard to self-esteem and well-being.

By querying festival-goers, we hope to capture acute responses to rapidly introduced surveillance from one year to another. In contrast to urban spaces, where surveillance and security measures are gradually (often unnoticeably) introduced (or increased), a change from one year to the next at a festival is very obvious and usually part of the festival marketing. Specifically, we asked participants for their observations on surveillance and security measures, if those change over time, if safety concerns are addressed, and if their behavior changes. We find that festival-goers are sensitive to surveillance, with the majority of our sample reporting noticing it and those that attend more festivals observing it more. Despite that positive correlation, we did not see a bias in responses in regular festival-goers to questions about surveillance. We notice three major trends across the survey: negative crowd behavior is the most pressing issue, crowd-sourced safety measures are most valued, behavior is not altered by concerns about safety but is slightly altered in the presence of surveillance. We notice three major gender-based trends: males are less likely to report being affected by concerns or surveillance, non-binary tend to have different views than male/female respondents, females have the most concerns about safety and surveillance. Ultimately, these data uncover important issues about what makes us feel unsafe and how that varies between groups. There is significant divergence across demographics on primary safety issues. Thus, policing measures taken in everyday life have a differential negative, neutral, or positive effect depending on the member of society experiencing them.

The relationship of cultural ecosystem services (CES) with biodiversity is unclear because CES requires subjective evaluations that are difficult to quantify. Toponyms, the places name, reflect human assessment of the natural environment components, such as species composition, that may be reflexed in the place designation. Therefore, regions with greater biodiversity (e.g. species richness) might be expected to exhibit a greater proportion of toponyms related to biotic elements that places with lower biodiversity. We assessed this prediction using the meaning of 346 municipalities in Chile. Specifically, we analyzed the relationship between species richness and the proportion of toponyms that reference biotic elements at two spatial scales: coarse-grained (regions) and fine-grained (municipalities) scales. Toponyms were categorized according to language origin as being either native (non-Spanish, mainly from Mapuche and Quechua people) or non-native (Spanish). At the coarse-grained scale, we found a positive correlation between species richness and the proportion of toponyms associated with biotic elements (e.g. species names). This relation was maintained when only native language toponyms were considered. At the fine-grained scale, only toponyms with native origin showed a marginal relationship between species richness and the probability that toponyms carry a meaning related to biotic elements. We observed that biodiversity is reflected in the name of places, reinforcing the cultural importance of biodiversity, especially among native people. We propose that toponyms could be incorporated into models used to measure the relative importance of Cultural Ecosystem Services.",TRUE,FALSE,biodiversity|conservation-decission making|Global Biodiveristy Information Facility|human well-being|natural resources,2018-11-29T20:28:20.943130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T20:28:08.687693,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/citation/,34j97,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a3qr2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/relationships/node/,a3qr2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c002f24aeafc8001788557a/,5c002f24aeafc8001788557a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/34j97/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/34j97,NA

This paper studies this episode with a model of technology adoption: a principal tries to induce costly effort from a group of agents charged with vetting new technology. The principal is unwilling to simultaneously punish large groups of agents, so they shirk when coordination is possible. Widely applicable technology expands productive possibilities but also provides an opportunity for coordinated shirking, and can thus lead to widespread production failure. Furthermore, even agents who learn that they are using flawed technology may continue to do so.",TRUE,FALSE,Financial crisis|Gaussian copula|Principal-agent|Securitized products|Technological innovation,2018-11-29T20:33:07.497925,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T20:32:35.290439,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/citation/,264vt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/urfyq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/relationships/node/,urfyq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfecc5fac9e8f0019af819f/,5bfecc5fac9e8f0019af819f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/264vt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/264vt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/264vt,NA
