Drawing on three distinct emerging conceptions and frameworks for the idea of “open” (open notebook science, linked open data, and open innovation) I suggest how this case study can be used to guide work with existing simple and inexpensive tools and how it could also inform the development of future tools, services and exhibit development methods. This work builds on an ongoing discussion of open data in libraries, archives, and museums.

Yet, prior work has not assessed the link between the two. We hypothesize that deportations exacerbate rates of foreclosure among Latinos by removing income earners from owner-occupied households. We employ a quasi-experimental approach that leverages variation in county applications for 287(g) immigration enforcement agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and data on foreclosure filings from 2005–2012. These models uncover a substantial association of enforcement with Hispanic foreclosure rates. The association is stronger in counties with more immigrant detentions and a larger share of undocumented persons in owner-occupied homes. The results imply that local immigration enforcement plays an important role in understanding why Latinos experienced foreclosures most often. The reduced home ownership and wealth that result illustrate how legal status and deportation perpetuate the racial stratification of Latinos.",TRUE,FALSE,287(g)|Deportation|Foreclosures|Immigration|Latinos|Mixed-status Households|Race|Stratification,2018-07-02T10:51:05.719957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-13T22:47:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/citation/,jjnu6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/du6rq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/relationships/node/,du6rq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5850799d6c613b021400aaf0/,5850799d6c613b021400aaf0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jjnu6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jjnu6/,https://doi.org/10.15195/v3.a46,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jjnu6

The Global North has tended to emphasize the common responsibilities of all nations to reduce emissions while nations of the Global South have tended to place more emphasis on the differentiated responsibilities. The Global North-South negotiating positions are derived from the inequality in: the historical and current emissions of greenhouse gasses, the emerging consequences of climate change, and the geo-political negotiating power between nation-states. However, these broad sweeping categories miss diverse goals and policy preferences among civil society actors within nations. Through in-depth, in-person interviews, this research documents the surprisingly strong presence of Global North policy preferences among the field of Kenyan environmental NGOs – a field that is significantly divided among the “climate justice” policy priorities strongly associated with nations of the Global South and “emissions reductions for all” priorities associated with nations the Global North.

Experiments that randomize populations to treatment and control conditions are the “gold standard” for causal inference. We identify, describe, and analyze the problem posed by *transformative treatments*. Such treatments radically change treated individuals in a way that creates a mismatch in populations, but this mismatch is not empirically detectable at the level of counterfactual dependence. In such cases, the identification of causal pathways is underdetermined in a previously unrecognized way. Moreover, if the treatment is indeed transformative it breaks the inferential structure of the experimental design. Transformative treatments are not curiosities or “corner cases”, but are plausible mechanisms in a large class of events of theoretical interest, particularly ones where deliberate randomization is impractical and quasi-experimental designs are sought instead.

To date, limited empirical work has examined how the gap between one’s perception of their own financial knowledge and their actual knowledge varies across the life course. We analyze the size and nature of the financial knowledge gap and its variation across the life course. We use nationally representative data from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) and find robust evidence that older adults overestimate their financial knowledge.

I used textual analysis to examine the presentations of the communist Yugoslavia institutionalized in the Croatian history textbooks and newspapers in 1991-2007, and I compared them to the accounts of the Yugoslav past among the Croatian transitional (born 1978-81) and post-communist generation (born 1989-91). These two generations were distinct in their childhood and formative years’ experiences of Yugoslavia and post-Yugoslav Croatia, but both depended on secondary sources such as parents, school and the media for their evaluations of the Yugoslav period.  
The present study found that the textbook and newspaper presentations, primarily shaped by the 1990s nation-building elites, mainly portrayed Yugoslavia in negative political, economic and ethnic terms. However, findings from 72 in-depth interviews with the two young Croatian generations suggested that the influence of the dominant negative re-evaluations was limited, particularly among the vocationally educated individuals who were least exposed to the institutionalized presentations of the Yugoslav past. In contrast, the young Croats, independently of their differences, generally dominantly evaluated Yugoslavia in positive social terms, which was a perspective obtained from their parents and older people recounting their good lives in Yugoslavia. This perspective was appropriated not only because its sources were emotionally available and credible, but also because the social lens on Yugoslavia helped the young Croats make sense of their lives in the social insecurities of the contemporary Croatian society. 
Therefore, the present study showed how different beliefs on the Yugoslav past, available from different sources, were appropriated and used by the young Croats. I also proposed Interactional Model of Collective Memories Formation, which elaborated how the influences on the beliefs of the past were formed at the macro, micro and the level of social interaction. Finally, this study also illuminated how active actors reinterpreted the presentations of the past, thus demonstrating how individuals can use culture in diverse and adept ways.",TRUE,FALSE,collective memories|Croatia|generations|social change,2018-07-02T10:49:06.110720,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-11T10:46:59.319000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/citation/,f685v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dsy6e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/relationships/node/,dsy6e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584d2de9b83f6901f1ad2997/,584d2de9b83f6901f1ad2997,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f685v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f685v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f685v

Using network data on all official bilateral aid relationships between countries in the period from 1975 through 2006 and data on recipient country ties to world society, the article offers an alternative explanation for the allocation of global foreign aid. Fixed effects negative binomial regression models on a panel sample of 117 developing countries reveal that global ties to world society in the form of non-governmental memberships and treaty ratifications are strong determinants of the network centrality of recipient countries in the global foreign aid network. Countries with a higher level of adherence and connection to world society norms and organizations are shown to be the beneficiaries of an increased number of aid relationships with wealthy donor countries. The findings also suggest that prior explanations of aid allocation grounded in altruist or realist motivations are insufficient to account for the patterns of aid allocation seen globally in recent years.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil society|Foreign aid|Human rights|Network analysis|World society,2018-07-02T10:51:04.956728,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-10T22:02:59.796000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/citation/,jdceb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qtg56/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/relationships/node/,qtg56,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584c7a4b594d9001fe560727/,584c7a4b594d9001fe560727,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdceb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jdceb/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.09.011,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jdceb
