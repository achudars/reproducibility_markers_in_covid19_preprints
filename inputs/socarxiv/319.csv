Lessons from a Campaign Against Vote Buying in Uganda","We estimate the effects of one of the largest anti-vote-buying campaigns ever studied—with half a million voters exposed across 1427 villages—in Uganda’s 2016 elections. Working with civil society organizations, we designed the study to estimate how voters and candidates responded to their campaign in treatment and spillover villages, and how impacts varied with campaign intensity. Despite its heavy footprint, the campaign did not reduce politician offers of gifts in exchange for votes. However, it had sizable effects on people’s votes. Votes swung from well-funded incumbents (who buy most votes) towards their poorly-financed challengers. We argue the swing arose from changes in village social norms plus the tactical response of candidates. While the campaign struggled to instill norms of refusing gifts, it leveled the electoral playing field by convincing some voters to abandon norms of reciprocity—thus accepting gifts from politicians but voting for their preferred candidate.",TRUE,FALSE,Africa|Elections|Field Experiment|Voting Behavior,2019-09-10T03:32:45.001680,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-10T03:32:25.699939,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/citation/,u34pr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d76b18b34e7c200194168fd/,5d76b18b34e7c200194168fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u34pr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u34pr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u34pr,NA

In clinical studies, power calculations are carried out as a standard. But what’s about economic experiments? After describing the basic idea of the calculation procedure, I tackle the practice of sample size calculations in the realm of experimental economics by considering the publications of 5 economic journals in the period 2000–2018. These are two top-ranked economic journals (Quarterly Journals of Economics and American Economic Review), the leading field journals in the area of experimental economics (Experimental Economics) and behavioral sciences (Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization), and a leading field journal in environmental economics (Environmental and Resource Economics). In contrast to clinical drug trials, sample size calculations have rarely been carried out by experimental economists. But the number of power calculations has slightly increased in recent years, especially in the leading journals of economics. However, this can be partly explained by the fact that field experiments (in which scholars pay more attention to power analyses than in lab experiments these days) play an important role in these journals.",TRUE,FALSE,multiple testing,2019-09-09T17:16:47.585245,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-09T17:16:15.979285,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/citation/,574he,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d766c5134e7c2001a426de0/,5d766c5134e7c2001a426de0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/574he/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/574he/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/574he,NA

Here, in a study of the Mentawai water spirit Sikameinan (Siberut Island, Indonesia), we address three questions: (1) Are smaller gods believed to enforce cooperation, especially compared to bigger gods in larger-scale societies? (2) Do beliefs in these deities encourage people to engage in behavior that would otherwise be perceived as costly? and (3) Does ritual reinforce beliefs in these deities? Drawing on interview responses, data from healing ceremonies, and ethnographic observation, we show that Sikameinan is believed to punish people who violate meat-sharing norms and that people ‘attacked’ by Sikameinan pay shamans to conduct healing rituals. The public nature of rituals, involving prestigious individuals apologizing to Sikameinan for the patient’s stinginess, reinforce onlookers’ beliefs about Sikameinan. The most widely shared beliefs about Sikameinan are represented in rituals while beliefs not represented vary considerably, indicating that ritual may be potent for cultural transmission. These results suggest that moralizing supernatural punishers may be more common than suspected and that the trend in the cultural evolution of religion has been an expansion of deities’ scope, powers, and monitoring abilities.",TRUE,FALSE,animism|belief|cooperation|religion|ritual|shamanism,2019-09-09T17:17:01.861599,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-09T17:16:49.230186,NA,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/bjq6f/,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb2|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Other Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/citation/,npkdy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bjq6f/,bjq6f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7669f734e7c20019412255/,5d7669f734e7c20019412255,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npkdy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npkdy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npkdy,NA

We show that any theory of crime in fact can define two related ideas about the victim, here called ideas of victimization and vulnerability, fixing their meaning and producing a constellation of testable predictions about their empirical properties. We then conduct a theoretical exercise contrasting how the internal logic of substantive positivist theories and choice theories would specify these ideas. We found that substantive positivism is not only the probable source of the aforementioned intellectual orthodoxy, but it also generates predictions about victimization and vulnerability that are inconsistent with the known facts. Choice theories, in contrast, incentivize scholars to attend to the victim and are able to make predictions that not only are consistent with known facts but that also suggest rich possibilities for the future growth of theory and research. Consideration of these ideas have important implications for falsifying longstanding criminological perspectives, by casting doubt on any crime theory that is unable to make believable empirical predictions about victimization and vulnerability.",TRUE,FALSE,criminological theory|criminology,2019-09-10T03:29:03.641415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-10T03:28:51.502262,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",None,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/citation/,6w8v7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7663cbd7413a0017622220/,5d7663cbd7413a0017622220,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w8v7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6w8v7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6w8v7,NA

These differences are obscured when Latino is used as a unit of analysis, suggesting that Latino is not a viable unit of analysis. Using Latino as a unit of analysis serves to misallocate resources intended to benefit victims of racial discrimination to Latinos with European phenotypes, as well as hiding the impact of discrimination on those with African or Amerindian phenotypes.

This raises questions of how stacking persists and how opportunities arise for athletes of different races to assume different roles. Demographic data on 41,484 NCAA football players reveal differences in opportunities and playing roles for student-athletes of different races. In concert with previous racial stacking studies, white players continue to be overrepresented in central, leadership positions. Racial minorities are overrepresented in peripheral ‘skill’ positions. Stacking at each playing position is affected differently by the demographics of player high schools and college teams. Players assuming non-stereotypical roles are much more likely to come from a racially homogenous high school or college team. Even though racially homogenous schools provide stereotype-defying opportunities, they also exhibit intense racial stacking. The few white (or black) players on such teams are overwhelmingly slotted into stereotypical positions. Since stereotype-defying opportunities tend to emerge in racially homogenous schools, blacks playing typically white positions come from relatively poor schools. In contrast, whites playing typically black positions are relatively affluent, since such opportunities tend to emerge in whiter, wealthier schools.

Seshat reflects both what is known about global history (within certain practical constraints, discussed below) and also what is unknown, or poorly known. Seshat is a continuously growing dataset incorporating evolving interpretations, highlighting persisting controversies, and contextualizing enduring ambiguities. The quantitative data, suitable for statistical analysis, is buttressed by qualitative nuance embedded in descriptive paragraphs along with references to pertinent scholarship.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-08T23:42:05.452849,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-08T23:41:48.387385,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce5|Arts and Humanities|History|Other History,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/citation/,394w2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d750208d7413a0018623cbf/,5d750208d7413a0018623cbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/394w2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/394w2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/394w2,https://doi.org/10.1558/jch.39395

Their critique centres around the roles played by research assistants and experts in procuring and curating data, periodization structure, and so-called ‘data pasting’ and ‘data filling’. We show that these criticisms are based on misunderstandings or misrepresentations of the methods used by Seshat researchers. Overall, their critique does not call into question any of our main findings, but it does highlight various shortcomings of Slingerland et al.’s rival database project. Our collective efforts to code and quantify features of global history hold out the promise of a new era in the study of global history but only if critique can be conducted in good faith, rivalries kept in check, and both promises and pitfalls of open science fully recognized.",TRUE,FALSE,|evolution|global history databank|open science|religion|social complexity,2019-09-08T23:41:44.712749,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-08T23:41:31.397370,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd9|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Religion,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/citation/,t8hgu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d74febc34e7c2001940326e/,5d74febc34e7c2001940326e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t8hgu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t8hgu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t8hgu,https://doi.org/10.1558/jch.39422
