Russia's labour market should have high rates of job mobility, but we will show using IMF figures that the  rate between 2011 and 2015 is on par with the 1980's. Beyond this, little is known about who is mobile and whether mobility has any impact on wages once the characteristics of movers are controlled for. In other words, we will ask whether job mobility is a sorting mechanism, or whether it has premiums in pay in and of itself. Results  show a gender difference in the likelihood of firm exit but not in the likelihood of promotion. When several personal and job characteristics are held constant, young men and women have similar odds of promotion. However, promotions have a positive effect only on the wages of young women; young men's wages are not affected. On the topic of firm exits, when several personal and job characteristics are held constant, exit is more common among young men when compared to young women;  this is also true of middle aged men and women. Further, young men see a significant  decrease in wages following an exit, while young women are not affected by exit. These results are flipped for middle aged workers; middle aged men see no change in wages following an exit, but middle aged women see significant declines in wages following an exit. Using these results, the article shows that the early stages of a respondent's career are marked by periods of high mobility, which is similar to the experience of young workers in other countries. After this period,  mobility becomes increasingly unlikely. Part of this result could stem from the premiums tied to promotion. Results help to understand processes of inequality in wages and conditions that occur due to sorting, and the importance of promotions  (internal job changes with the same employer) as 'life chances' which improve  earnings in the immediate sense. Gender differences in securing these life chances help to understand wider gender gaps in earnings, which emerge later.",TRUE,FALSE,Gender|Inequality|Job mobility|Panel analysis|Russia,2020-03-03T18:57:00.927244,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-03T18:23:11.831886,FALSE,NA,no,This dataset requires an application.,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/citation/,ncb5p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5d83e186b40d0042d0536a/,5e5d83e186b40d0042d0536a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncb5p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncb5p/,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecot.12264,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ncb5p

This debate generated ample empirical evidence of the environmental damage caused by tourism-related human activity.

An alternative, more active approach, is to deliberately design for environmental sustainability.

The goal of this paper is to experimentally explore who is good at distinguishing between true and false, and, second, to learn something about the mechanisms to debunk false news stories. While the vast majority of earlier studies tackles political topics, the subjects had to rate environmental-related as correct or false. After this exercise, subjects received systematically varied information about the correctness of the news stories depending on the experimental condition they had been assigned to. After a delay of three weeks, the subjects were asked to evaluate the news stories again. Our main findings are (i) The perceived familiarity with news stories increases the propensity to accept them as true. Actively open-minded thinking helps to distinguish between true and false. But the willingness to think deliberately does not seem to be important. (ii) By repeating false news stories, subjects are more likely to adequately identify them later (i.e., no evidence for a familiarity backfire effect). However, it decreased the ability to adequately identify correct news stories. A somewhat reverse, but weaker effect occurs when true stories are repeated: the correct identification of correct news stories is more successful, but the opposite holds for the identification of false news stories. Detailed explanations of why the false news stories contain false content increases the correct identification of false news stories, but the ability to correctly identify correct news stories is detrimental.",TRUE,FALSE,actively open-minded thinking|cognitive reflection test|environmental economics|experimental economics|False news stories|narratives,2020-03-02T02:50:52.978501,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-02T02:50:27.541845,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/citation/,zmx5p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5b308bef5d8901ca06cc9d/,5e5b308bef5d8901ca06cc9d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmx5p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmx5p/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmx5p

This article discusses open datasets developed during the Ebola outbreak response in 2014 and the role of collaborative repositories such as GitHub in enabling uses beyond any particular citizen science project. How citizen scientists can creatively contribute in ways aligned with humanitarian aims is explored, emphasising benefits of open licensing for promoting active citizenship and humanitarian disaster responses.",TRUE,FALSE,citizen science|Ebola|emergency|GitHub|open data|open source|pandemic|public health|Pybossa,2020-03-02T02:48:53.989474,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-02T02:48:09.149594,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/citation/,4bf23,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpka4/,tpka4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5ae9b3ef5d8901c106bf06/,5e5ae9b3ef5d8901c106bf06,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4bf23/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4bf23/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4bf23

However, researchers also tend to hold strong negative opinions about Trump. Consequently, they have approached this research with uncharitable priors about the kind of person who would support him and what they would be motivated by. Research design and data analysis often seem to be oriented towards reinforcing those assumptions. This essay highlights the epistemological consequences of these tendencies through a series of case studies featuring prominent and influential works that purport to explain the role of race and racism in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It demonstrates that quality control systems, which should catch major errors, seem to be failing in systematic ways as a result of shared priors and commitments between authors, reviewers and editors – which are also held in common with the journalists and scholars citing and amplifying this work – leading to misinformation cascades. Of course, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, prejudicial study design, and failure to address confounds are not limited to questions about Trump – however they seem to be particularly pronounced in this case due to the relative homogeneity and intensity of scholars’ views about this topic as compared to other social phenomena. “Trump studies,” therefore, provides fertile ground for exploring how social research can go awry – and the consequences of these failures -- particularly with respect to work on contentious and politically-charged topics.",TRUE,FALSE,Donald Trump|journalism|political science|political sociology|race and ethnicity|race and racism|sociology|sociology of knowledge,2020-03-02T02:47:20.575634,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-02T02:47:05.469627,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/citation/,n8bkh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5acedab070fc01cde5cab0/,5e5acedab070fc01cde5cab0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n8bkh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n8bkh/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-018-9373-5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n8bkh

Our study shows that this is not the case. We demonstrate how a destination can proactively and deliberately manage the organic image of being environmentally sustainable by redirecting money typically spent on communicating green credentials towards the implementation of publicly visible pro-environmental initiatives. With organic image being a key driver of destination choice, investing in pro-environmental initiatives suddenly becomes a rational marketing investment. This is particularly important given the increasing environmental concern of consumers. The invaluable side-effect of redirecting “green marketing dollars” towards “green action dollars” is the improved environmental performance of the destination",TRUE,FALSE,destination image|environmental image|environmental sustainability|organic image|positioning|pro-environmental action,2020-03-02T02:46:00.855806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-02T02:45:53.183025,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e10|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Public Relations and Advertising,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/citation/,vxm29,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5acb51b070fc01c9e5c6ea/,5e5acb51b070fc01c9e5c6ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxm29/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vxm29/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vxm29
