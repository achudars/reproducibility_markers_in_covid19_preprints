Monetary sovereignty is typically used in a Westphalian sense to denote the ability of states to issue and regulate their own currency. This article rejects the Westphalian conception. Instead, it proposes a conception of effective monetary sovereignty that focuses attention on what states are actually able to do in the era of financial globalization. The conception fits the hybridity of the modern credit money system by acknowledging the crucial role not only of central bank money but also of money issued by regulated banks and unregulated shadow banks. These institutions often operate ‘offshore’, outside of a state’s legal jurisdiction, which makes monetary governance more difficult.

Respondents were also asked to report on the sports involvement histories and contexts, family and school experiences, and health and well-being of a child between 6 and 17 years old if they had such a child who also shared a residence with them. A targeted sample of 4,000 adults was established using members of the American Population Panel (APP) so that important subgroup analyses could be undertaken, and to allow for follow-up interviews to be conducted with sufficient numbers in today’s climate of declining survey responses. The NSASS was designed and enacted by Prof. Chris Knoester (PI), with support from the College of Arts and Sciences, the Sports and Society Initiative, and CHRR at The Ohio State University.

The present research suggests that the exposure to both overly congruent and incongruent opinion climates on SNS can increase opinion strength and selective exposure while decreasing political tolerance. It is proposed that a balance of congruent and incongruent views can mitigate these effects provided that users do not identify with an ideological camp. In a representative pre-registered online experiment (N = 704), the levels of political congruence with an opinion climate on SNS and political social identity were manipulated. Different from what was hypothesized, results revealed very limited effects of political congruence. A salient political social identity decreases tolerance and opinion strength, but only for certain political issues.

We bring together archeological, paleoclimatological, and botanical data to explore relationships over the past 4,000 years between people and camas (Camassia quamash), a perennial geophyte with an edible bulb common across the North American Pacific Northwest. In this region throughout the late Holocene, people began experimenting with selective harvesting practices through targeting sexually mature bulbs by 3500 cal BP, with bulb harvesting practices akin to ethnographic descriptions firmly established by 1000 cal BP. While we find no evidence that such interventions lead to a selection for larger bulbs or a reduction in time to maturity, archeological bulbs do exhibit several other domestication syndrome traits. This establishes considerable continuity to human intervention into camas life cycles, but these dynamic relationships did not result in unequivocal morphological indications of domestication. This approach to tracking forager plant management practices offers an alternative explanatory framework to conventional management studies, supplements oral histories of Indigenous traditional resource management, and can be applied to other vegetatively propagated species.",TRUE,FALSE,foragers|geophyte|harvesting|Pacific Northwest|traditional ecological knowledge|traditional resource management,2020-11-12T01:22:42.525030,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T01:22:12.541723,FALSE,NA,available,"Some of the data is drawn from a paper that is in press and not officially released just yet, but should be soon.

The purpose of the current study was to assess the impact of the spread of the COVID-19 infection and mask-wearing behavior on voting behaviors and political affiliation during the 2020 national election.
Methods: During a two-week period from September into October 2020, YouGov, in association with Saint Louis University, conducted an online cross-sectional survey consisting of participants that were likely to vote in Missouri in the upcoming national election (n=931). 
The sample was stratified into two groups: those that reported always wearing a mask or face-covering in public spaces and those that did not. Individual socio-demographics and environmental factors were compared between these groups to identify significant differences according to mask-wearing patterns. Additionally, two adjusted multivariate models were constructed to determine probability of (1) reporting always wearing a mask and (2) planning on voting in-person on election day. Indicators in each model included reported political party affiliation, and urbanicity, presence of mask mandate, and recent COVID-19 rate, respective of reported Missouri county of residence.  
Results: The sample consisted of 931 participants across Missouri that were likely to vote during the 2020 Presidential election. Among this sample, 38.5% resided in counties with a mask mandate at the time of the survey.
Individuals who resided in either suburban or urban counties were twice as likely to report always wearing a mask compared to rural residents. In addition, while individuals from counties with a mask mandate were over twice as likely to report always wearing a mask, county COVID-19 infection rates were not found to be a significant predictor of mask-wearing. Republicans and Independents were significantly less likely to report always wearing a mask. Compared to Democrats, Republicans were 4 times, and Independents were 2 times, more likely to vote in person on election day compared to Democratic party members. These results were significant even when adjusting urbanicity, residing in a county with a mask mandate, and county COVID-19 case-rate. While urbanicity and COVID-19 infection rate were determined to not add significantly to model performance, those that lived within a county with a mask mandate were nearly 50% less likely to vote in person on election date.
Discussion: Overall, this study identified significant relationships that are likely to contribute to the spread of COVID-19.

For this, I build upon Feld's concept of social circles, Breiger’s concept of the duality of actors and groups, and Hinde’s concept of interactions and relationships. The theory emphasizes that ties between actors arise and evolve according to social circles and social situations in which they participate, a notion straightforwardly modeled through two-mode and projected networks. Using recent results aided by analyses of empirical and artificial networks, I argue that structural properties such as tie strength, heterogeneity of popularity and strength among actors, clustering, community formation, and segregation emerge from homophily, jointly with overlap and social activity—mechanisms introduced in this study. The mechanisms form the two-mode network, and these structural properties naturally arise in the one-mode projection. The results show that social circle and social situation size distributions modulate network structures by interweaving with social activity distributions, and that overlap increases segregation from a network viewpoint. This theory’s implications are broad, affecting several social processes ranging from social cohesion, tolerance, and child development to the spread of infectious diseases.",TRUE,FALSE,homophily|network formation|social activity|social circles|social structure|two-mode networks,2020-11-12T01:32:02.108774,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T01:31:43.864917,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://icon.colorado.edu/|https://github.com/dvasques83/arxiv_metadata,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/citation/,5cyuq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5faaa3ea9c7a4e01b8a06131/,5faaa3ea9c7a4e01b8a06131,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cyuq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5cyuq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5cyuq,NA

The results are based on two types of data – spatial and anthropological. Spatial data are represented in the visualization of recent agricultural features (Milpas) visualized from orthophoto maps, processed in QGIS 3.10.1. Anthropological data were obtained during July and August 2019 in the Uaxactún, as a part of the Regional Archaeological Project of Uaxactún (Proyecto arqueológico regional Uaxactún – PARU). 18 respondents had taken part in the research. The research was conducted by semi-structured interviews and participant observation. To list finds – the average Milpa dimension was described, most interesting crops and agricultural techniques were described, and a model of the local agricultural year was provided. The key find is that, even if one could interpret recent Uaxactún agriculture as traditional, the drives and motivations of the farmers are modern, capitalistic, and monetary oriented.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|maize|milpa|pepioria squash|swiden agriculture|traditional agriculture|Uaxactún,2020-11-12T13:10:21.181867,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12T13:10:01.165410,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/citation/,5jcxr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/md4k8/,md4k8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5faa8d51d1894f01df68b719/,5faa8d51d1894f01df68b719,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jcxr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5jcxr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5jcxr,NA
