However, its dynamics are complex and often difficult to understand. This paper presents an agent-based model of urban settlement, agglomeration, displacement, and sprawl. New settlements form around a spatial amenity that draws initial, poor settlers to subsist on the resource. As the settlement grows, subsequent settlers of varying income, skills, and interests are heterogeneously drawn to either the original amenity or to the emerging human agglomeration. As this agglomeration grows and densifies, land values increase, and the initial poor settlers are displaced from the spatial amenity on which they relied. Through path dependence, high-income residents remain clustered around this original amenity for which they have no direct use or interest. This toy model explores these dynamics, demonstrating a simplified mechanism of how urban displacement and gentrification can be sensitive to income inequality, density, and varied preferences for different types of amenities.",TRUE,FALSE,ABM|agent-based model|agglomeration|complexity|complex systems|displacement|economic development|emergence|gentrification|housing|inequality|land use|modeling|self-organization|simulation|social justice|urban planning|urban sprawl|zoning,2018-07-02T10:51:42.853255,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-23T21:07:07.289000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/citation/,mkq7d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wkarz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/relationships/node/,wkarz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d43848b83f690209be9ca6/,58d43848b83f690209be9ca6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mkq7d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mkq7d/,https://doi.org/10.3390/urbansci2030076,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mkq7d

However, we do not know the extent to which these strategies impact change at the neighborhood scale across the U.S. In this chapter, we examine the relationship between the growth and locations of craft breweries and the incidence of neighborhood change. We rely on a unique data set of geocoded brewery locations that tracks openings and closings from 2004 to the present. Using measures of neighborhood change often found in the gentrification literature, we develop statistical models of census tract demographic and employment data to determine the extent to which brewery locations are associated with social and demographic shifts since 2000. The strongest predictor of whether a craft brewery opened in 2013 or later in a neighborhood was the presence of a prior brewery. We do not find evidence entirely consistent with the common narrative of a link between gentrification and craft brewing, but we do find a link between an influx of lower-to-middle income urban creatives and the introduction of a craft brewery.

Its 2 distinct forms are directed at changing this situation in different ways, either by becoming as successful as the envied person (in benign envy) or by lowering the envied person’s advantage (in malicious envy). In essence, envy is thus a social phenomenon. Nevertheless, most previous research has focused on its underlying intrapersonal processes, overlooking envy’s interpersonal core. In contrast, we show in 6 studies (N = 1,513) that envy and pride are intertwined in a social-functional relationship. Envy and pride often co-occur (Study 1) and pride displays enhance envious feelings (Studies 2 and 3). Specifically, authentic (success attributed to effort) and hubristic pride (success attributed to talent) modulate envious intentions and behavior toward their benign and malicious form (Study 2 to 6). This effect is mediated via liking, perceived prestige, and perceived dominance (Study 4). In accordance with a social-functional approach, the effects emerge only when authentic and hubristic pride are expressed by the superior person and not when the respective information about the superior person’s feelings is simply available in the environment (Study 5). These effects are present when participants recall envy situations (Study 1), when they imagine being in a competitive situation (Studies 3, 4, and 5), or when envy is elicited in situ (Studies 2 and 6). Our findings show the value of studying envy as a social phenomenon and open up numerous avenues for research on envy at the interpersonal and intergroup level.",TRUE,FALSE,authentic pride|benign envy|competition|envy|hubristic pride|malicious envy|motivation|pride|social comparison|social functions of emotions|social judgment,2018-07-02T10:49:08.281282,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-23T08:20:26.866000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,APA,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/citation/,fu3e3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vehzp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/relationships/node/,vehzp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d38437594d90020b5b3238/,58d38437594d90020b5b3238,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu3e3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fu3e3/,https://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000026,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fu3e3

terrorists adjust their fatalities when unexpectedly deprived of public attention, relative to Al
Shabaab terrorists, that were not deprived of public attention. Losing public attention raises the
severity of terrorism: Boko Haram terrorist fatalities surged following the rebasing of Nigeria’s
economy, which catapulted the country into Africa’s largest and the top twenty-five worldwide.
The largest spike in Boko Haram terrorist fatalities occurred in the wake of the Nigerian Ebola
health crisis. Although Boko Haram claims an anti-education sentiment, their fatalities do not
actually differ significantly from Al Shabaab fatalities during the Nigerian national basic education
examination. Overall, terrorists consider well-being changes as threats that have more

This article argues that this theoretical imbalance is problematic as it ignores key stratification processes. The article then develops three concepts that link culture to downward mobility and three concepts that link culture to upward mobility. These concepts offer initial steps toward understanding how cultural differences between the classes are associated with class mobility as well as class reproduction.,TRUE,FALSE,culture|inequality|mobility|social class,2018-07-02T10:52:04.987336,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-20T21:52:29.002000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/citation/,rc9s9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e7j8d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/relationships/node/,e7j8d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d04eb56c613b01fded8b38/,58d04eb56c613b01fded8b38,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rc9s9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rc9s9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rc9s9

Moses profoundly transformed New York's urban fabric and transportation system, producing the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the Westside Highway, the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the Lincoln Center, the UN headquarters, Shea Stadium, Jones Beach State Park and many other projects. However, The Power Broker did lasting damage to his public image and today he remains one of the most controversial figures in city planning history. On August 26, 1974, Moses issued a turgid 23-page statement denouncing Caro's work as ""full of mistakes, unsupported charges, nasty baseless personalities, and random haymakers."" Moses's original typewritten statement survives today as a grainy photocopy in the New York City Parks Department archive. To better preserve and disseminate it, I have extracted and transcribed its text using optical character recognition and edited the result to correct errors.
