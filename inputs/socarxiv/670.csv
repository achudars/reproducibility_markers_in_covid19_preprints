Neo-classical economic theory would predict a positive association between skill inequality (as measured in student test scores) and earnings inequality, while educational attainment inequality adds little on top of skills inequality. A sociological theory of social closure, however, argues that inequality in educational attainment is more important than skills inequality in the prediction of earnings inequality. Using educational policies as instruments, we find causal effects of skills inequality and educational attainment inequality, suggesting that a simple human capital model is insufficient to explain rising earnings inequalities. Nevertheless, skills inequality appeared a more important predictor of earnings inequality than educational attainment inequality. Some educational policy reforms (like public preschool provision or introducing standardised tests) led to reduced educational dispersions, and thereby reduced earnings inequality in adulthood.

Mobilization cascades in direct democratic initiatives","Caveat emptor: I have retired this manuscript. I will not improve on it any more, and it will not be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

This paper explores the possibility of mobilization cascades in direct democratic popular initiatives. A mobilization cascade is a salience-based mobilizing effect whereby one popular initiative has a positive mobilizing effect on a subsequent popular initiative that deals with with a similar policy issue. The existence of a mobilization cascade would imply that voters develop salience for and positive attitudes towards policy issues merely through direct-democratic exposure to those policy issues in the recent past. In order to explore the mobilization cascade, I analyze three popular initiative pairs from Switzerland from the years 2012, 2013 and 2014. In each year, two initiatives dealt with similar policy issues, and the second initiative in each pair was making more far-reaching demands. The results suggest that a mobilization cascade might exist, but that it is probably a weak effect.",TRUE,FALSE,ballot measures|direct democracy|mobilization|public opinion|switzerland,2018-07-02T10:51:03.442224,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-03T06:18:59.788000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/citation/,hqb2p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5xuck/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/relationships/node/,5xuck,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5894204f594d900200ed23f2/,5894204f594d900200ed23f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hqb2p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hqb2p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hqb2p,NA

Using Kenya as a case study, this paper uses natural capital (NC) and infrastructural capital (IC) to compare the enabling environments of entrepreneur vs. government run off-grid electrification projects, explores the role that NC and IC can play in determining wealth creation post-electrification, and develops a micro-enterprise development (MED) index indicating regions in Kenya that could be well positioned for wealth creation (and thus, persistent demand) post-electrification. A comparison between the MED index and a nightlights GDP per capita proxy finds that their local differences are informative towards the management and use of local resources, suggests that a nightlights proxy could provide a large underestimate, and sheds light towards regions where the gap between achieved and unrealized potential may be large. We hypothesize that the large discrepancy between our MED index and the night lights income proxy is due to an underestimate of economic activity by night lights (most of the economic activity in rural areas happens during the day), the nature of the MED index being a measure of ‘potential’, and several other factors that could affect both variables such as local climate and environmental conditions, population stress on natural resources, quality of infrastructural capital (not only access), local corruption, and ethnic favoritism.

Thinking with Margulis about humans as holobionts, our species is both constituted by and embedded within communities of organisms and ecologies. As holobionts we may not be able to live outside of these communities and systems or away from Earth, even if we can temporarily survive without them. Placed within an evolutionary framework, techno-capitalist imaginaries of space settlement limit conceptions of planetary reproduction to heteronormative models of ecopoiesis which promote competition as a key driver of evolution instead of cooperation. Technologically mediated survival along with forced reproduction of holobionts within Earth-like systems and could lead to suffering and isolation like David Vetter’s forced survival in a bubble. I propose alternative liberatory modes of conceptualizing and materializing space migration (including queer and decolonized forms of reproduction) which better respect the Earth, its inhabitants, as well as extraterrestrial planets, landscapes, lives, and possibilities.

Given the long-running debate on the positive relationship between education and health, the question arises how this development in doctor–patient relations affects social inequalities in health. First, we test to what extent egalitarian (e.g. discussing treatment decisions with patients) doctor–patient relations are underlying the education–self-reported health association. Second, we test whether egalitarian and paternalistic (e.g. withholding some information from patients) doctor–patient relations show differential effects on self-reported health across educational groups. Analyses of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2004/2005 for 24 countries demonstrate that a more egalitarian doctor–patient relationship does not substantially reduce educational inequalities in self-reported health. However, some direct positive effects of egalitarian and direct negative effects of paternalistic doctor–patient relations on health ratings can be found. Finally, results show how the health status of the lower educated can improve with a more egalitarian and less paternalistic doctor–patient relationship.",TRUE,FALSE,doctor-patient relations|health care|health inequalities|patient-centered care|Physician–patient relations|self-rated health,2018-07-02T10:51:43.219090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-01T17:36:51.663000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/citation/,mv7mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b4mp2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/relationships/node/,b4mp2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58921905594d9001faed1f97/,58921905594d9001faed1f97,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mv7mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mv7mf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mv7mf,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001699316670715

It defines urban science, details its practioners and their aims, sets out its relationship to urban informatics and urban studies, and explains its epistemology and the analysis of urban big data. It then summarizes criticism of urban science with respect to epistemology, instrumental rationality, data issues, and ethics. It is concluded that urban science research will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, providing a valuable means of making sense of cities, but that it is unlikely it will become a new paradigm, producing an integrative approach that replaces the diverse philosophical traditions within urban studies.",TRUE,FALSE,cities|critique|data analytics|epistemology|urban analytics|urban big data|urban informatics|urban science|urban studies,2018-07-02T10:52:07.965941,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-01T12:43:36.951000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/citation/,sdsu2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/thj7c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/relationships/node/,thj7c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5891d747b83f6901f00f7e8d/,5891d747b83f6901f00f7e8d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdsu2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sdsu2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sdsu2,NA
