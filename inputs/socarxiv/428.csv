Temporary migration to developing countries might play a role in generating individual commitment to development, but finding exogenous variation in travel with which to identify causal effects is rare. In this paper we address this question using a natural experiment – the assignment of Mormon missionaries to two-year missions in different world regions – and test whether the attitudes and activities of returned missionaries differ.

Register synthesis has tended to use more theoretically articulated notions of register and genre than analysis work, which often seeks to categorize on the basis of intuitive and somewhat incoherent notions of prelabeled “text types”. I argue that a integration of computational register analysis and synthesis will benefit register studies as a whole, by enabling a new large-scale research program in register studies. It will enable comprehensive global mapping of functional language varieties in multiple languages, including the relationships between them.

Called the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) System, this infrastructure constructed “the economy” as a composite statistical object, composed of many disparate, non-fungible substantive elements that could not have been otherwise patched into a coherent whole.

They have even endured long after his October 1981 assassination. But how did a man that Egyptians referred to as a nukta, or a joke, manage to succeed Gamal Abdel Nasser after his death in September 1970, to spearhead the 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel, to move Egypt away from the Soviet sphere of influence, and to re-align the country’s economic and foreign policies with the United States?

The ‘Enhanced School Health Initiative’ (ESHI) targeted 30 primary schools in southern Ethiopia and aimed to improve the health and educational outcomes of school children through an integrated package of school feeding, deworming and the provision of improved water sanitation and hygiene (WASH). This study investigated parental perceptions of this integrated school health and nutrition programme. 
Methods. The data was collected through group interviews with parents of children at schools targeted by the programme. Ten schools were purposively selected to represent geographical diversity. A team of two trained facilitators led the group interview in each school. All interviews were conducted in local dialects and then directly translated into English and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings are structured around key themes identified from the discussions.
Results and Discussion. Three main themes are identified from the interviews. The first relates to the perceptions of equity and opportunity generated for the children and the parents as a result of the programme. The second theme identifies the dissemination of learning throughout the community reported by parents. This includes the use of children as messengers, particularly for good hygiene practices and importance of deworming. The final theme explores concerns about ownership and sustainability of the programme within the communities. When probed on the topic of sustainability, parents raised conflicts surrounding ownership, and their ability to sustain the programme without further external input. 
Conclusions.

We find that place based factors predicting whether homeless individuals are victimized or the offender being homeless are largely consistent with one another. Out of 26 different crime attractors and generators, prior drug arrests, homeless shelters, and bus stops are the three biggest factors in predicting homeless related crime. We show how the RTM model can effectively forecast future homeless related crimes as well. This suggests that targeted spatial strategies can reduce both homeless offending and victimization risk. Given that the majority of homeless individuals are only intermittently homeless, place based strategies may be a more an effective way to limit risk than strategies that focus on individuals.

This construct was articulated to support and strengthen doctoral education. This paper expands the construct of stewardship so that it can be applied to both scholars and non-academic practitioners, and can be initiated earlier than doctoral education. To accomplish this, we describe a general developmental trajectory supporting cross-curriculum teaching for stewardship of a discipline as well as of a profession. We argue that the most important features of stewardship, comprising the public trust for the future of their discipline or profession, are obtainable by all practitioners, and are not limited to those who have completed doctoral training. The developmental trajectory is a Mastery Rubric, which requires articulating the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be targeted with a curriculum; recognizable stages of performance of these KSAs; and performance level descriptors of each KSA at each stage. Concrete KSAs of stewardship that can be taught and practiced throughout the career (professional or scholarly) were derived directly from the original definition. We used the European guild structure’s stages of Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master for the trajectory, and through a consensus-based standard setting exercise, created performance level descriptors featuring development of Bloom’s taxonometric cognitive abilities for each KSA. Together, these create the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship (MR-S). The MR-S articulates how stewardly behaviour can be cultivated and documented for individuals in any disciplinary curriculum, whether research-intensive (preparing “scholars”) or professional (preparing members of a profession or more generally for the work force). We qualitatively assess the validity of the MR-S by examining its applicability to, and concordance with professional practice standards in three diverse disciplinary examples: 1) History; 2) Statistics and Data Science; and 3) Neurosciences. These domains differ dramatically in terms of content and methodologies, but students in each discipline could either continue on to doctoral training and scholarship, or utilize doctoral or pre-doctoral training in other professions. The MR-S is highly aligned with the practice standards of all three of these domains, suggesting that stewardship can be meaningfully cultivated and utilized by those working in or outside of academia. The MR-S can be used for curriculum development or revision in order to purposefully promote stewardship at all levels of higher education and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-08T03:29:26.910611,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-07T20:15:27.061470,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/citation/,vw7j5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3394fa7cf3f5001bb1d812/,5c3394fa7cf3f5001bb1d812,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vw7j5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vw7j5,NA
