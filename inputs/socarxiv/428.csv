Evidence of the effects of changing temperatures and precipitation on children’s nutritional status nonetheless remains limited. Research addressing this knowledge gap is merited given the short- and long-run consequences of malnutrition. We address this issue by estimating the effects of temperature and precipitation anomalies on the weight and wasting status of children ages 0-59 months across 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Linear regression models show that high temperatures and low precipitation are associated with reductions in child weight, and that high temperatures also lead to increased risk of wasting. We find little evidence of substantively meaningful differences in these effects across sub-populations of interest. Our results underscore the vulnerability of young children to climatic variability and its second-order economic and epidemiological effects. The study also highlights the corresponding need to design and assess interventions to effectively mitigate these impacts.",TRUE,FALSE,child health|climate change|malnutrition|sub-Saharan Africa|vulnerability,2019-06-14T01:43:01.359735,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T01:42:44.913860,FALSE,NA,no,All source data can be accessed through IPUMS-DHS and the CRU TS described in the manuscript.,,no,This study was not preregistered.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Brian Thiede and Johann Strube,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/citation/,fnt5m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d02efe90bea130019b4a193/,5d02efe90bea130019b4a193,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fnt5m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fnt5m/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102192,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fnt5m

Women may be pushed out of computing in their youth, but they can come back—and they do. Using data from in-depth interviews with women graduates of coding bootcamps (accelerated programs that teach beginners digital skills), this study provides empirical data on how and why women enter computing later in life, often after having non-technical degrees and careers. This study finds that to successfully enter the computing workforce, women must arrive at three end states, which are often achieved via three transitions: “I can’t code” to “I may code;” “I’m on another path” to “I want to code;” and “I can code” to “I do code.” In addition, this study finds surprising evidence of women choosing to enter computing for better pay and work-life balance, in contrast to research that suggests women leave for these reasons.

The analysis employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to co-integration in order to examine both the short and long run dynamics among the variables. Furthermore, the study uses the Granger procedure within the VAR framework to identify causality among the variables. The model used in this study is found to be sound, a diagnosis of the reliability of the model reached by testing normality, functional form, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity, with stability of the model tested using a cumulative sum and cumulative sum square test, based on recursive regression residuals. The ARDL approach to co-integration reveals that real GDP growth positively influences energy consumption as well as significantly in both the short run and long run, while energy prices and technological innovation influence energy consumption negatively and significantly. The results ascertain that energy consumption and economic growth are independent of each other, and thus they support a neutral hypothesis for Denmark.

At present, the public sector is a matter of global concern due the constant cases of failures in governance, fraud, inefficacy, and corruption. As such, this sector has been pressurized to provide justification of the sources and usages of public resources and to improve their service performance as the public has the right to monitor the public sector management’s transparency and efficacy. This study evaluates the state of present integrity practices among public sector employees from various Malaysian service schemes.
Design/methodology/approach – Primary data were collected using a questionnaire survey approach with 194 heads of departments in the Malaysian federal ministries. The collection of data was according to the perspective of 13 factors in integrity practices using a five-point Likert scale. Factor analysis and descriptive statistics were utilized for data analysis. In addition, data reliability was checked by Cronbach’s alpha test, data normality was examined by Skewness and Kurtosis tests, and data validity was tested by using Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test and Barlett’s test.
Findings - The findings show that 92.6% of the participants reported that they practised integrity within their departments. Nevertheless, the priority for these integrity factors varies according to the service schemes. In general, the departments of finance, audits, and administration had an above average integrity practice level however the practice of the accounting scheme is below the general average level.
Practical/Policy implications - This findings of the study will help policy makers to take necessary steps to improve the practices of integrity in the public sector in order to create a more dependable and efficient public sector in Malaysia.
Originality/value – This is an original study based on primary data that assesses the performance of practicing integrity in the public sector of Malaysia.",TRUE,FALSE,Factor Analysis|Integrity|Malaysia|Public Sector,2019-06-14T16:06:42.421637,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T15:58:54.960863,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/citation/,a96xq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4nqr6/,4nqr6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d022ad97b8c4d001a9aed72/,5d022ad97b8c4d001a9aed72,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96xq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a96xq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a96xq

There are several factors such as social, economic, political, demographic, natural, and livelihood strategies that causes to the vulnerability of the status of household food security. Therefore examining the vulnerability of these factors is essential to identify the reason and recognize the most vulnerable communities. This study is an attempt to study on the vulnerability of the factors of household food utilization and its linkage with climatic changes in Malaysia. The study is based on primary data collected in the months of July – October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 low income households from East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on cluster random sampling technique. The study found that the vulnerability of the factors of household food utilization has increased statistically significantly over the last five years period due to difference between rural and city food quality, occurrences of natural disasters, incidences of mosquitoes, insects, pest, etc., and diseases like dengue, malaria, heat stretch, cold, skin disease, etc. This study suggests that the food security programs need to be integrated with climatic change adaptation programs to ensure more effective and sustainable household food security in future, especially among the poor and low income group.",TRUE,FALSE,Climatic Changes; Household Food Security; Food Utilization; Vulnerability; Poverty,2019-06-14T16:05:47.645054,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T15:56:51.963697,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/citation/,b5mnr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wqdr9/,wqdr9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d022a1b7b8c4d001a9aed00/,5d022a1b7b8c4d001a9aed00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5mnr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b5mnr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b5mnr
