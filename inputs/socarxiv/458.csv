Organizations use experiments to test new strategies in a low stakes setting. Yet organizations also use experiments to evaluate managers who will implement these strategies \emph{online}. I develop a formal model to demonstrate that these two types of evaluation are fundamentally incompatible. Managers who fear replacement in response to a poor offline outcome will pervert their experiments to maximize the likelihood that they succeed. This saps offline experiments of much of their informational value. I show that if an organization can observe a manager's experimental strategies and the experiment's outcomes \emph{and} can commit ahead of time to an evaluation and replacement rubric, then it can resolve this principal-agent problem. However, if a manager's experimental strategy cannot be credibly communicated, and thus are evaluated solely based on experimental outcomes, the organization faces two risks in its effort to promote effective offline experiments. If the organization replaces managers based on their offline outcomes, then it risks replacing good managers. If the organization never replaces managers, then it risks retaining bad ones. I demonstrate that when experimental outcomes are more certain, replacing managers based on observed offline outcomes produces the best results. When outcomes are less certain, commitment to retention regardless of offline outcomes is best.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-21T23:31:06.410731,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-21T23:30:36.509305,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Scott C.

It is suggested that information on the number of children, structural and associational intergenerational solidarity can be utilized to operationalize the continuum. Subjective wellbeing is utilized as outcome of interest.  
Data from waves 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe are used. The sample includes 183,545 respondents from 21 countries. Linear regression models with clustered standard errors are used. 
Childless older individuals report lower levels of life satisfaction than parents. However, the largest difference is observed between those with one and two children. Using a measure of associational intergenerational solidarity to weight the degree of parenthood it is shown that parents who have infrequent contact with children report significantly lower levels of life satisfaction than childless individuals.
Kinless-ness is not only a demographic but also a social condition. When studying the consequences of ageing alone it is essential to consider not only the presence and “quantity” of kin, but also its “quality”.",TRUE,FALSE,childless|childlessness|Europe|family|fertility|kinlessness|parenthood,2018-10-19T16:09:24.979189,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T16:09:07.626771,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/citation/,xtfq6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nmzsx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/relationships/node/,nmzsx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc9d96e6a9364001a6c1744/,5bc9d96e6a9364001a6c1744,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtfq6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xtfq6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xtfq6

On the other hand, there is a need to disrupt the ‘present future’ of neoliberal smart urbanism, moving beyond minimal politics to enact sustained strategic, public-led interventions designed to create more-inclusive smart city initiatives.

The remainder of the paper provides an initial framing for engaging with these questions.

We then detail some of the ethical issues associated with smart city technologies and initiatives. Having set out some of the more troubling aspects of how social relations are produced within smart cities, we then examine how citizens and citizenship have been conceived and operationalised in the smart city to date.

Findings include a balance between nominal and adjectival modification, tendency toward attributive processes in first and second person while third-person singular verbs have attributive and also material and mental processes. In addition, collocations of ‘bite’, ‘teeth’ and ‘braces’ are detailed.

Throughout the article, the role of corpus compiler-as-researcher (Koester, 2010) is discussed as an advantage in understanding the corpus by locating findings within a deeper contextual use.

This hostility is typically attributed to social group identity, motivated reasoning, or a combination thereof.  In this paper, I empirically examine a novel explanation: the ``unmotivated'' cognitive bias of overprecision (overconfidence in precision of beliefs).  Overprecision could cause partisan hostility indirectly via inflated confidence in one's own ideology, partisan identity, or perceptions of social distance between the parties.  Overprecision could also cause this hostility directly by causing excessively strong inferences from observed information that is either skewed against the out-party or simply misunderstood.  Using a nationally representative sample, I find consistent support for direct effects of overprecision and mixed support for indirect effects.  The point estimates imply a one standard deviation increase in a respondent's overprecision predicts as much as a 0.71 standard deviation decline in relative out-party favorability.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-19T13:24:21.784079,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T13:24:09.120886,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/citation/,hr5ba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mwjys/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/relationships/node/,mwjys,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc74f1953cec40018af0356/,5bc74f1953cec40018af0356,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hr5ba/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hr5ba
