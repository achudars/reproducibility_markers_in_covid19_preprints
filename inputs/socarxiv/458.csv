Evidence from a Matching Approach.,"We investigate whether grants improve the academic outcomes of students from socioeconomically
disadvantaged families and, by this way, contribute to reducing inequalities
of educational opportunities. Differently from most previous studies, we focus on Italy, a
context with high dropout rates and prolonged duration of higher education studies. To
estimate the causal effect of the grant we followed a counterfactual approach relying on
a three-step reweighting matching procedure, applied to survey data collected at national
level by ISTAT on a sample of upper secondary school graduates in 2004 and 2007. We
?find that grants reduce drop-out and increase timely graduation, with larger effects among
males and students in Central-Southern Italy, those who are more at risk of withdrawal
from university.",TRUE,FALSE,CEM|drop-out|entropy balancing|Financial aid|timely graduation,2019-04-08T22:25:01.222746,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T22:24:37.801763,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Marta Facchini|Moris Triventi and Loris Vergolini,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/citation/,k3gwv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab5edf08a3bf001a0251ef/,5cab5edf08a3bf001a0251ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3gwv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k3gwv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k3gwv,NA

Still, the conventional FE estimator relies on the assumption of parallel trends between treated and untreated groups. It returns biased results in the presence of heterogeneous slopes or growth curves that are related to the parameter of interest (e.g., selection into treatment is based on individual growth of the outcome). In this study, we derive the bias in conventional FE models, and show that fixed effects individual slope (FEIS) models can overcome this problem. This is a more general version of the conventional FE model, which accounts for heterogeneous slopes or trends, thereby providing a powerful tool for panel data and other multilevel data in general. We propose two versions of the Hausman test that can be used to identify misspecification in FE models. The performance of the FEIS estimator and the specification tests is evaluated in a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Using the examples of the marital wage premium and returns to preschool education (Head Start), we demonstrate how taking heterogeneous effects into account can seriously change the conclusions drawn from conventional FE models. Thus, we propose to test for bias in FE models in practical applications and to apply FEIS if indicated by the specification tests.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects|fixed effects individual slopes|Hausman test|Head Start returns|heterogeneous effects|marital wage premium|Monte Carlo simulations,2019-04-08T22:24:28.126999,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T22:24:00.539812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Tobias Rüttenauer|Volker Ludwig,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/citation/,k4rnu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dr8x3/,dr8x3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab46cbdf977b001af44b10/,5cab46cbdf977b001af44b10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k4rnu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k4rnu,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124120926211

Family theories hypothesize that disruption of household routines and reduction in household resources link family instability to poorer child well-being. Recent research reveals that maternal partnership transitions represent a small fraction of the household instability children experience. These other forms of household instability might also be consequential for child well-being. The goal of this study is to determine whether household instability involving non-parental household members in children’s households is associated with changes in children’s educational outcomes using longitudinal data available in the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).

Previous research shows the generic structure of acknowledgements written by native Persian postgraduate students contains a ‘thanking-God move’, absent in native English speakers’ acknowledgements. In an approximate replication of Hyland’s (2004) study of the generic structure of acknowledgments, we aimed to verify the occurrence, frequency, and variation of moves and steps in three small corpora of acknowledgments from six disciplines (applied linguistics, business management, computer science, electrical engineering, microbial biotechnology, &amp; biochemistry). Each corpus contained 200 sample acknowledgements written in Persian or English. The authors were native Persian speakers and native English speakers. Fifty acknowledgements (100-400 words) were randomly selected from each corpus and analyzed using Hyland’s model. Two coders carefully, content-analyzed, and coded the acknowledgments. Then the data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results confirmed findings of previous research indicating that acknowledgements written by native Persian speakers (in Persian &amp; in English) contain all the moves and steps defined by Hyland plus a new step called ‘thanking-God’ step.

The subject has been raised in an English-speaking country milieu (United States of America), while she has been used to speaking Arabic at home. In this regard, the paper highlights the aim of the encoded usage of code-switching utterances in term of addressing the monolingual brain hypothesis. This qualitative study is based on open observations of two continues months of a toddler as the participant of this study aiming at exploring whether children’s greeting differ from those of adults and whether this greeting differs between two languages with regard to monolingual brain hypotheses. So far, the study concluded that greeting has never been mixed upon context, though utterances are code-switched. Moreover, the greeting process is comprehended and acquired within the language context as a pragmatic speech act regarding greeter’s identity, context, and gender. Findings of this study significantly support the cognitive approach in term of greeting via using a high frequent greeting word among the American culture. As would cognitive linguists suggest, greeting speech act response varies regarding how greeters of each community greet the subject, but not how they greet each other’s in a community.

The participants were divided into two groups: experimental and control groups. Among the 28 students in the sample, those in the experimental blended learning group (n=13) were taught using Moodle while those in the control group (n=15) were taught using conventional methods. All the 13 participants in the experimental group were interviewed. The results of the posttest revealed that students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control group. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis results showed that blended learning had a positive impact on the learners’ English grammar performance and that they were strongly satisfied and motivated to learn English using similar methods. It is concluded that blended learning could be used as an effective method of teaching English grammar in EFL settings. It is hoped that these results will help the university, faculty, and students to develop the skills necessary for blended learning.",TRUE,FALSE,attitude|blended learning|EFL students|grammar|Moodle|Performance,2019-07-20T21:43:05.219240,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:42:39.622890,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/citation/,eytjn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa590108a3bf001902d0e4/,5caa590108a3bf001902d0e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eytjn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eytjn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eytjn,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.27

To achieve the aims of this study, and try to find an answer as to the way teachers and learners react to Modern Standard Arabic and Algerian Arabic in attitudinal terms inside the school context, two instruments were utilized to collect data. First, a questionnaire was administered to a sample consisting of 12 teachers and then, the matched-guise technique was designed to 72 pupils from two different primary schools. Based on both a quantitative and qualitative approaches, the findings of this empirical study reveal that both teachers and pupils display positive attitudes towards Modern Standard Arabic since it is granted an outstanding predominance and prestige in the community, especially because of its tight association with the Qur’an. However, the findings also reveal that pre-school grade pupils hold a less positive attitude towards Modern Standard Arabic and favour Algerian Arabic instead.",TRUE,FALSE,Algerian arabic|attitudes|diglossia|modern standard arabic|pupils|teachers,2019-07-20T21:42:02.256645,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:41:41.700095,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/citation/,xzv3h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa5863df977b0019f430fe/,5caa5863df977b0019f430fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzv3h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xzv3h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xzv3h,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.26

A Feasibility Study in Promoting a Saudi-Owned TASL Programme,"Given that teaching Arabic, as a second language has become increasingly significant in the present context, it follows that there is an urgent and pressing need to develop efficient learning tools as well as adequate measuring tools for testing the learner’s development. There are numerous problems associated with measuring a learner’s proficiency in Arabic in the context of Western cultures. These problems are related to the non-adaptability of measuring tools from one setting into another without taking cultural factors into account. The difficulties faced by scholars in adapting Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) tools to the Saudi context is an example. However, the problems associated with such an adaptation indicate the need for context-specific language acquisition measuring tools. Either currently existing tools such as TESOL need to be radically altered to fit Saudi contexts and requirements, or entirely new tools must be created in order to test the efficacy of language learning in Saudi Arabia. This study aims at a close examination of ways in which existing tests such as TESOL may be adapted or modified to suit the requirements of teachers and learners in the Saudi context. A survey and evaluation of existing tools was followed by developing new tools specifically for Arabic language. It concludes by giving recommendations for proposed modification of existing strategies for Arabic learners that associates the language more directly with functional workplace contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic language learning|second language learning|standardised testing|teaching Arabic as a second language (TASL),2019-07-20T21:41:42.456431,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:41:16.683764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/citation/,2q5rd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa57c9641d10001bbf0ec0/,5caa57c9641d10001bbf0ec0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2q5rd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2q5rd,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.25
