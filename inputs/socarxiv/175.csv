However, most male Saudi students show minimum efficient in L2 writing skill and do not have sufficient competence for writing the authentic English passages. To enhance this various study were undergone to cope up the gap between the student’s use of lexical and cohesive ties by applying task-oriented teaching. However, the immediate need to fill the gap, the researchers made pioneer study on this filed. The present study investigates analysis of lexical and cohesive ties usage in undergraduate students’ writing by applying task-based language learning methodology. The study was performed by thirty-five students from an advanced ESL Reading class at King Saud University, Arts College in Riyadh for 15 weeks. This study has been investigated by Four English passages including behavioral psychology, scientific and two general passages throughout the semester respectively. The analysis of the obtained data proved that the students’ language abilities in grammar and vocabulary significantly improved especially in the discourse analysis passages. In addition, the results of the study evidenced that students are more engaged and motivated during group work activities, and learn more about structure, identifying, cause and effect, purpose and function and if clause of analyzing passages. Proficiency of grammatical category results concluded among the 35 students, average 60% of the students were prefect in tenses, passive structures, if clause, cause and effect, purpose and function, documented 37.14,57.14,54.28 and 77.14% respectively.

However, not all questions are effective in doing so, as some questions sometimes go unanswered.  When faced with a situation such as this, teachers must adjust their questions to make it more understandable.  This study investigates question modification strategies employed by student teachers in English as a second language (ESL) class.  Data for the study was collected through classroom observations. The participants were seven Diploma in Teaching English as a second Language (TESL) students who were undergoing their compulsory 12-week teaching practicum (TP) at various primary schools in Terengganu.  The data were analyzed thematically based on the types of strategies used in the process.  The finding shows that the most popular modification strategies among the STs are repetition and translation.  Besides, the choice of modification strategies is limited to just a few.  Many strategies were not fully utilized in class.  The findings highlight important pedagogical implications for education providers (EPs) to improve on to produce competent teachers.  EPs should expose student teachers to a wide array of question modification strategies to prevent interaction breakdown and to encourage active participation in the class.

The child, whose name is Anmar, was raised in a typical Arabic environment where Arabic was the only means of communication he experienced. He watched selected English TV cartoons since he was three years old and until he was ten years old. This research study focused on Anamr's acquisition of pronunciation, although the chances to use the language were very limited due to his EFL environment. Additionally, the study aims at comparing Anmar's pronunciation of problematic sounds to Arab learners of English, as stated in previous studies. The research adopted a longitudinal research methodology aiming to find if watching English TV cartoons without even minimum use of language could impact the child's pronunciation compared to his counterparts of Arab learners of English. Therefore, this research utilized some methods, including rating some audio and video recordings of conversations with his father and storytelling. Two native speakers of English rated his performance. A mispronunciation recognition test was carried out to evaluate Anmar's recognition of mispronunciation. The study found out that Anmar's pronunciation was native-like. He far outperformed the Arab learners of English concerning the problematic sounds to Arab learners. He easily differentiates between, for instance, minimal pairs, diphthongs, consonant clusters, vowels, and intonation. The study concluded that children might acquire English pronunciation by watching TV cartoons to be able to overcome the pronunciation problems that many Arab speakers experience. Additionally, English learners in elementary schools may watch such programs to train them to listen to authentic language in media.",TRUE,FALSE,Acquisition|Arab|EFL leaner|English cartoons|phonetics|phonology|pronunciation,2020-06-14T11:13:20.773276,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:13:04.908275,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/citation/,ftg3a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5a4aa44eab500a0523aa8/,5ee5a4aa44eab500a0523aa8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ftg3a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ftg3a/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ftg3a

If public goods are to materialize, social norms are to emerge, and social protests are to succeed, individuals must act jointly to achieve their collective ends. But how can collective action evolve when individuals receive the benefits of a common good without contributing to its production?  According to theories of the critical mass, the success of collective action depends on the type of production function required for the provision of a common good. Production functions and mobilization functions, however, have proven difficult to observe empirically in large groups. Here, we report results from a factorial survey experiment administered to a disproportionate stratified random sample of undergraduate students (N = 880) that required respondents to rate their perceptions of and intentions to participate in a hypothetical student protest.  Results show that the population-average production and mobilization functions are decelerating, but that individual heterogeneity is observed around the population averages.  Moreover, our experiment demonstrates that latent class trajectories of production and mobilization functions, rather than population-level consensus or complete individual heterogeneity, exist in the population. We show that the majority of latent class trajectories are decelerating, while a minority are linear or relatively constant. We find that subjective interest in the common good and attitudes toward protest predict membership in latent class trajectories.  Importantly, we provide evidence for the predictive validity of our estimates.

For Smith history teaches that development is more accidental than fitting deterministic models.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-13T11:06:36.643857,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-13T11:06:13.229967,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,History of Economics Society,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/citation/,ztc2y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee3f67e44eab5006e5219cd/,5ee3f67e44eab5006e5219cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ztc2y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ztc2y/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ztc2y

We performed Internet searches for the existence of the statues and historical attacks in New Zealand (NZ), combined with field visits to all identified statues to examine for injuries and repairs. Of the 123 statues identified, nearly a quarter (n=28, 23%) had been attacked at least once (total of 45 separate attack events), with the number of attacks increasing from the 1990s. Attacks involved paint/graffiti (14% of all statues at least once), nose removal/damage (7%), decapitation (5%), and total destruction (3%). The risk of attack was relatively higher for statues of royalty (50%), military personnel (33%), explorers (29%), and politicians (25%), compared to other reasons for fame (eg, 0% for sports players). Statue subjects involved in colonialism and harm to Māori, had 6.61 (95%CI: 2.30 to 19.9) greater odds (adjusted odds ratio, aOR) of being attacked than other subjects. Similar results were found for statue subjects having any involvement with the military (aOR= 4.17; 95%CI: 1.65 to 11.3). Most of the statue subjects were of men (87%) and Europeans (93%). Other ethnicities were 6% Māori (NZ’s Indigenous population comprising 15% of the population) and 1% each for Asian and Pacific peoples, who comprise 12% and 7% of the population respectively. In conclusion, there is evidence that attacks on these statues may reflect the role of statue subjects in past social injustices and militarism. Furthermore, the demography of the statue subjects in this country represent historical and current social power relationships – with under-representation of women and non-European ethnic groups.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-13T11:05:02.451875,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-13T11:04:45.066811,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/citation/,e6agq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee3b0b9a777b7005aab3ea9/,5ee3b0b9a777b7005aab3ea9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6agq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e6agq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e6agq

In this paper, we seek to develop natural language processing (NLP) models to accelerate the extraction of relationships from scholarly papers in social sciences, identify hypotheses from these papers, and extract the cause-and-effect entities. Specifically, we develop models to 1) classify sentences in scholarly documents in business and management as hypotheses (hypothesis classification), 2) classify these hypotheses as causal relationships or not (causality classification), and, if they are causal, 3) extract the cause and effect entities from these hypotheses (entity extraction). We have achieved high performance for all the three tasks using different modeling techniques.
