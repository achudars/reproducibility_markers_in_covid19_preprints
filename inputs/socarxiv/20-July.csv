Recent studies have shown gay bars to be quite vulnerable, with listings showing a 36.6% decline between 2007 and 2019. To supplement historic data from comprehensive printed listings, the Damron Guide, we conducted a census of online business listings. We verified each listing in the 2019 edition, also searching for new bars that were not included in that version. Results show that gay bar listings declined by 15.2% between 2019 and Spring 2021. This compares, however, to a 14.4% decline for 2017 and 2019, indicating a surprisingly stable rate of decline. This stability may be a methodological artifact, but may also reflect the relative resources of surviving gay bars going into pandemic, and/or their continuing vulnerability and precarity.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus public closure orders|COVID-19 pandemic|gay bars|LGBT placemaking|queer leisure,2021-06-16T01:20:42.349756,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-16T01:20:24.849394,FALSE,NA,no,Data available to other scholars subject to data sharing agreement.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/citation/,4uw6j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c8e1d618f70b043aa7610a/,60c8e1d618f70b043aa7610a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4uw6j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4uw6j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4uw6j,NA

Nevertheless, they continue to contribute significantly less to a couple’s income than their male partners. Here, we ask how the gender income gap within couples has changed over the past decades and in which groups it has decreased or increased. We synthesize streams of argumentation regarding the sources of changes in the gap into one broad perspective on the changing opportunities available to coupled women to convert their income potential into actual income contributions, and how this relates to the income trends of their male counterparts. Using German Microcensus data, we show that West German women contributed 16.5% to couples’ income in 1978 and had increased their contribution to 30.1% by 2011. Our decompositions reveal that women contributed to this mostly by changes in composition, namely due to being more highly educated and working longer hours. Women contributed very little due to increased income returns. Income trends of non-working women are a notable exception. In contrast, men contributed to the trend with changes in income returns.

Drawing on focus group interviews with undergraduate women at a mid-sized university in Canada, I examine the shared rituals, practices, and perceived risks within women-centered friendship groups during a typical “girls’ night out.” I confirm that undergraduate women experience many potential risks to their safety and well-being as they navigate the hookup scene and interact with undergraduate men. To try to mitigate those risks and attempt to enjoy their nights out, I find that undergraduate women spend significant portions of their evenings dedicated to women-centered bonding rituals and partying. I show that undergraduate women engage in gendered strategies within their friendship group to have fun, connect with desirable hookup partners, and try to keep their friends safe. By expanding the social scripts of their nights out in hookup culture, I show the types of gender selves that are produced within women-centered friendship groups and reveal the importance of women-centered friendship groups to the maintenance of hookup culture itself.",TRUE,FALSE,Consent|Friendship|Gender|Hookup Culture|Sexuality,2021-06-16T01:17:26.969226,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-16T01:17:06.337626,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/citation/,wubzm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c8bb7018f70b042ea7787d/,60c8bb7018f70b042ea7787d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wubzm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wubzm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wubzm,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12720

This is arguably because mass gatherings are associated with a high risk of contagion yet, at the same time, peaceful public assembly is a protected human right. In this paper we explore this juxtaposition empirically using a case study to provide a detailed chronological interactional analysis of the policing operation surrounding a highly controversial public assembly, that took place on Clapham Common in London in March 2021. We explore the utility of a research and theory-based model for public order policing in pandemics as a framework for understanding the way the event evolved and identifying what lessons can be learnt for policing assemblies for both future pandemics and more generally. We contend that ambiguity in the application of emergency powers created a polarisation between stakeholders that culminated in a leadership vacuum among protesters. Moreover, the context of acute political sensitivity led to a highly centralised public order operation that limited the capacity of police to enact dialogue-based solutions when leadership (re)emerged during the event. We conclude by discussing the implications of our analysis for understanding the inherent dangers of regulatory frameworks that place too heavy a burden of discretionary power into the hands of police in determining whether public assemblies are ‘lawful’, and under what conditions they can occur.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Police legitimacy|Police powers|Public assemblies,2021-06-16T01:16:22.452186,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-16T01:16:08.903780,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/citation/,7jcsr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c88e4418f70b03fea7a2d4/,60c88e4418f70b03fea7a2d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jcsr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jcsr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jcsr,NA

Methods: Our scoring system was partly based on previously published factors favouring the eradicability of vaccine-preventable diseases. But it was also supplemented by additional technical, socio-political, and economic factors that we considered relevant.
Results: On our scoring for eradication feasibility using a three-point scale and across 17 variables, the mean (total) scores were smallpox at 2.7 (43/48), then covid-19 at 1.8 (30/51), and then polio at 1.5 (26/51). More specifically for covid-19 eradication, animal reservoirs may potentially prevent it; but the main challenges are probably around the high upfront costs and achieving international cooperation. Nevertheless, an advantage for covid-19 eradication over these other diseases is that effective PHSMs can complement vaccination and there is very high global interest in covid-19 control (due to the massive scale of the health, social and economic burden).
Conclusions: In this preliminary analysis, the feasibility of covid-19 eradication globally seems slightly more feasible than for polio, but much less than for smallpox eradication. There is a need for a more formal expert review of feasibility and desirability of attempting covid-19 eradication by the World Health Organization or coalitions of national health agencies.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|disease elimination|disease eradication|eradication criteria|polio|smallpox|zoonoses,2021-06-16T01:15:00.846763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-16T01:14:34.007978,FALSE,NA,no,All the relevant data used in the analyses is in Table 1 in the manuscript.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/citation/,f67gn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c81588da0ff203db397b08/,60c81588da0ff203db397b08,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f67gn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f67gn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f67gn,NA

Building on and refocusing the Four- Phase Model of interest development, this study provides a window into the ecology of the learning experience and interest it generates. This research tests a task interest model for understanding learning experiences in three university courses (mathematics, biochemistry and introduction to physics for non-majors) and pilots a micro-analytic approach to capturing these experiences during lectures/tutorials. Students' interest in tasks, a single class and the domain of study were collected. Short surveys were conducted through an online platform during class, immediately following task experiences.

Results show that, among the largest water systems, private ownership is related to higher water prices and less affordability for low-income families. In states with regulations favorable to private providers, water utilities charge even higher prices. Affordability issues are more severe in communities with higher poverty and older infrastructure. Water policy needs to address ownership and regulation and explore new mechanisms to ensure water affordability for low-income residents.",TRUE,FALSE,affordability|price|Privatization|regulation|water,2021-06-15T00:24:45.430139,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-15T00:24:16.688722,FALSE,NA,no,Data is derived from public and private sources.

For this purpose, we consider two central themes of their protest: vaccination and caring for their loved ones. From a sociological perspective, we show how their protest affirms the gendered division between the private and the public spheres that is constitutive of bourgeois capitalist society, and what role romantic thought plays in this. The women accept the social role assigned to them as caring women and creatures of nature. From a philosophical perspective, we illuminate how this affirmation is accompanied by a threat to society. That threat is based, as we point out with Hegel, on a contradiction of woman and society. Their protest reveals paradigmatically the dialectical movement of affirmation and endangerment of the bourgeois capitalist order.",TRUE,FALSE,corona-virus protest|gender relations|Hegel|romanticism|vaccination|women,2021-06-15T00:35:23.741729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-15T00:34:56.910382,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/citation/,bn8vk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c736b018f70b0398a768a5/,60c736b018f70b0398a768a5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bn8vk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bn8vk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bn8vk,NA
