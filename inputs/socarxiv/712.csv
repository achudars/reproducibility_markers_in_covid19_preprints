This paper develops a typology of measures and indicators for assessing the physical complexity of the built environment at the scale of urban design. It extends quantitative measures from city planning, network science, ecosystems studies, fractal geometry, statistical physics, and information theory to the analysis of urban form and qualitative human experience. Metrics at multiple scales are scattered throughout diverse bodies of literature and have useful applications in analyzing the adaptive complexity that both evolves and results from local design processes. In turn, they enable urban designers to assess resilience, adaptability, connectedness, and livability with an advanced toolkit. The typology developed here applies to empirical research of various neighborhood types and design standards. It includes temporal, visual, spatial, scaling, and connectivity measures of the urban form. Today, prominent urban design movements openly embrace complexity but must move beyond inspiration and metaphor to formalize what ""complexity"" is and how we can use it to assess both the world as-is as well as proposals for how it could be instead.",TRUE,FALSE,complexity|fractals|information theory|livability|neighborhood|network analysis|resilience|street networks|sustainability|urban design|urban form|urban morphology|urban planning,2018-07-02T10:55:53.638712,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-26T18:06:17.108418,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/citation/,bxhrz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9pj5u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/relationships/node/,9pj5u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5900e1306c613b02514e77a7/,5900e1306c613b02514e77a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxhrz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bxhrz/,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41289-018-0072-1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bxhrz

A pilot study was performed in which subjects (n=18) were first randomly assigned to one of two versions of a signal detection task, where feedback was either paired with a controllable or an uncontrollable mild shock. Subsequently, subjects underwent a social evaluative threat fMRI paradigm to measure their response to the anticipation of speaking in public. The analyses tested whether the controllability manipulation influenced behavioral and physiological responses and vmPFC network topology.  Results showed that overall subjects were faster to respond to potential shock trials in the signal detection task, and there was a trend significant difference between the  controllable or uncontrollable group. No significant differences between the two groups were observed on other behavioral or physiological responses. fMRI results showed higher vmPFC efficiency in the controllable threat group at baseline and recovery but similar to the uncontrollable group during speech anticipation. The current report establishes the feasibility of the protocol and adequately-powered follow-up research is needed to further evaluate the generalization effect on the behavioral, physiological and neural level.",TRUE,FALSE,Behavioral Control|fMRI|Network Topology|Social Threat|vmPFC,2018-07-02T10:55:52.599504,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-25T13:25:01.038837,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/citation/,7hu8w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ds5jx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/relationships/node/,ds5jx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58ff4c74b83f69024f4731c1/,58ff4c74b83f69024f4731c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hu8w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7hu8w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7hu8w

If you purchase products from a business that pays the pizzo you are indirectly supporting the mafia. By encouraging Palermitans to buy from ‘pizzo-free’ businesses, Addiopizzo uses the purchasing power of the consumer to fight organised crime. The community of ‘pizzo-free’ businesses is small but steadily growing whilst the number of critical consumers pledging to buy their products appears to have peaked. This article aims to investigate the reasons why consumers may be reluctant to support ‘pizzo-free’ businesses by asking those who have already made public their decision to do so. Whilst critical consumers cannot fully explain why the majority of Palermo's citizens continue to tolerate the pizzo system their attitudes towards them do highlight differences that may help to account for wider non-participation in Addiopizzo's campaign.",TRUE,FALSE,Addiopizzo|antimafia|protection money|Sicily|social movements,2018-07-02T10:55:52.187580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-24T21:00:35.827518,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/citation/,exquy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hj2gx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/relationships/node/,hj2gx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58fe65d0b83f69025146cb70/,58fe65d0b83f69025146cb70,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exquy/,https://doi.org/10.1080/13532944.2011.594999,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exquy

This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|reproducibility,2018-07-02T10:55:51.910351,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-24T06:27:57.015580,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/citation/,vknbt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c8e5p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/relationships/node/,c8e5p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58fd9a4e594d90024f95a44e/,58fd9a4e594d90024f95a44e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vknbt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vknbt/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-015-9272-9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vknbt
