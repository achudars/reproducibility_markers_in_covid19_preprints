Exploring the Economic Interface in European Port Cities,"In last three decades, planning agencies of most ports have institutionally evolved into a (semi-) independent port authority. The rationale behind this process is that port authorities are able to react more quickly to changing logistical and spatial preferences of maritime firms, hence increasing the competitiveness of ports. Although these dedicated port authorities have proven to be largely successful, new economic, social, and environmental challenges are quickly catching up on these port governance models, and particularly leads to (spatial) policy ‘conflicts’ between port and city. This chapter starts by assessing this conflict and argue that the conflict is partly a result of dominant—often also academic—spatial representations of the port city as two separate entities. To escape this divisive conception of contemporary port cities, this chapter presents a relational visualisation method that is able to analyse the economic interface between port and city. Based on our results, we reflect back on our proposition and argue that the core challenge today for researchers and policy makers is acknowledging the bias of port/city, being arguably a self-fulfilling prophecy. Hence, we turn the idea of (planning the) port/city conflicts into planning the port-city’s strengths and weaknesses.",TRUE,FALSE,Port-Cities; Relational Approach,2019-12-18T14:07:21.139260,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-18T14:07:12.911400,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/citation/,qtuyf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfa23f864e19d000d0fa35a/,5dfa23f864e19d000d0fa35a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtuyf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qtuyf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qtuyf,NA

Exchanges, control &amp; capital markets in authoritarian capitalism","A growing body of research has analyzed the variegation of financialization processes and the role of states as important actors therein.  Contributing to this literature, this paper argues that more than important actors facilitating financialization, states can also (partially) exert control over, actively manage and shape financialization. In the context of China’s variegated financialization process, this paper analyzes the crucial role of securities exchanges in the development of China’s capital markets since the global financial crisis 2007–09. These state-owned exchanges act as intermediaries between the Chinese state, society and finance by shaping the infrastructural arrangements of capital markets. Thereby, they facilitate the authorities’ ability to control markets and direct their outcomes towards state policies. Financialization is thereby decoupled from a neoliberal policy paradigm, and rather than a break with China’s authoritarian capitalism, exchanges facilitate state control within and through financialization.",TRUE,FALSE,authoritarian capitalism|capital markets|China|financialization|market infrastructures|securities exchanges,2019-12-18T14:06:44.244065,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-18T14:06:29.394234,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/citation/,kcp3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df92f0d1abedf000aa84031/,5df92f0d1abedf000aa84031,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kcp3g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kcp3g,NA

Methods: I use data from the 1989-2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) linked to the National Death Index (NDI) through 2002. Analyses assess how match score and match class vary by ethnicity, nativity, and age and whether mortality hazard ratios are sensitive to shifts in match criteria. Results: Linkage quality is lower for Hispanic and foreign-born adults than for non-Hispanic white and U.S.-born adults.

This includes the different forms of abuse and intimidation that the Act seeks to address. As part of its functions as the Approved Agency, Netsafe has conducted the first in a series of Annual Population Surveys (APS). The objective of the APS is to gauge attitudes and behaviours and to start monitoring national trends regarding potentially harmful digital communications in Aotearoa-New Zealand. This report presents the main findings of the 2017 APS. The APS is the first nationally representative study that looks at adult New Zealanders and digital communications in the context of the Act. Key aspects of the Act - such as the communication principles - and key internet safety concepts have informed the development of the research instrument and the analysis of its findings.

The study was planned and administered by Netsafe between February and September 2017. An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,018 adult New Zealanders (aged 18 ) between 30 May and 30 June 2017. Data collection was conducted by Colmar Brunton. The maximum margin of error for the whole population is ±3.1% at the 95% confidence level.

The study provides insights regarding New Zealanders’ access to and use of digital technologies. It also explores people’s level of awareness of the Act. A key focus of the study is to measure participants’ experiences of digital communications, including perceptions and experiences of harm and distress in the last 12 months. Finally, the study presents relevant insights regarding New Zealanders’ personal responses, and access to services and resources to deal with unwanted digital communications as well as potential harm and distress.

As research on adult New Zealanders and their experiences with digital communications is limited, the APS provides first-hand research evidence on this subject to government agencies, online content and service providers, law enforcement, the research community, and the general public. However, considering the evolving nature of new technologies and how people engage with digital tools, new online challenges and risks are likely to emerge. Thus, the study of the nature and impact of digital communications, including potential harm and distress, will remain a relevant but challenging area of research, analysis, and policy intervention.",TRUE,FALSE,cyber abuse|cyberbullying|digital communication internet|digital communications|online harm|online harrassment|quantitative research|social media|survey|technology,2019-12-18T21:41:02.019224,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-18T21:40:37.046510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/citation/,g6ctw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df80cc09a7ce3000a62820b/,5df80cc09a7ce3000a62820b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ctw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ctw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ctw,NA
