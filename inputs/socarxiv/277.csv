In this paper, we first offer a survey of the theoretical literature on this issue. We systematize the existing models by classifying them into two families and show that they can explain the emergence of classic types or property rights. We then explore a new model where agents can become the sole owner of a commonly owned production resource through an exclusion contest. We show that if overexploitation under joint property is severe enough relative to the returns to scale of conflict activities, private property emerges out of conflict. Inequality makes common ownership less likely to emerge. Finally, we characterize the set of common ownership regimes which are Pareto efficient and immune to conflict. Results show that proportionality to labour inputs in output sharing makes common ownership more resilient to conflict when inequality is higher.",TRUE,FALSE,Common pool resource|Conflict|Open Access|Property Rights,2020-05-08T11:49:47.074807,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-08T11:49:24.602622,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/citation/,2wgyx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb536ffa2199501025d4cac/,5eb536ffa2199501025d4cac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wgyx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2wgyx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2wgyx,NA

Studying Americans' demand for these policies is important, as support for universal vote by mail could place pressure on policymakers to implement policies that encourage turnout, without jeopardizing public health. Drawing on insights from social and political psychology, we theorize that -- while self-identified liberals are typically more likely to support vote-by-mail policies than conservatives  -- anxiety about COVID-19's health risks could erase these differences. In a demographically representative survey of U.S. adults conducted in late April 2020 (N = 1,015), we find strong ideological asymmetries in vote-by-mail support among individuals who are not concerned about COVID-19's health effects. However, and consistent with our theory, we find that highly-concerned liberals and conservatives alike are highly supportive of universal vote-by-mail. The results suggest that anxiety about the pandemic may play an important role in shaping demand for universal vote-by-mail policies, across the ideological spectrum.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Political Psychology|Political Science|Public Opinion|Vote by mail|Voting,2020-05-08T12:00:00.671279,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-08T11:59:40.024897,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/citation/,yatjc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nku47/,nku47,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb3f70da2199500a15d5aaa/,5eb3f70da2199500a15d5aaa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yatjc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yatjc,NA

However, most research on how parental time inputs affect child development focuses on maternal time, and it remains empirically unclear how paternal involvement in the child’s upbringing influences child outcomes. This study provides the first systematic account of how father-child time (in total and across activity types) relates to children’s cognitive development, measured using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. In addition, it examines whether and how paternal education moderates these associations. To accomplish this, the study uses unique, longitudinal, time-diary data from an Australian sample of children aged 4-8 years (Longitudinal Study of Australian Children; n=3,273 children/6,960 observations). Results show that the total amount of father-child time is associated with small improvements in children’s cognitive functioning, whereas the amount of father-child time in educational activities is associated with moderate-to-large improvements.

However, contemporary developments suggest a fundamental shift. Preferences for a- and anti-democratic political parties and authoritarian(-like) relationships between politics and civil society are gaining support. Remarkably, these developments originate and thrive in the midst of exactly those democratic structures rejected. We therefore ask if there is a new understanding of democracy, and we empirically identify a discernible category of people who support illiberal understandings of democracy. These citizens with disparaging views of democracy reject democratic processes and actors, and weakly support common norms of citizenship. Yet, they are active in politics. Because we find that it is actual participation which stimulates the understandings of democracy, our results suggest that instead of attempting to exclude citizens with illiberal understandings of democracy from political arenas, meeting them there can offer the opportunity to nurture more liberal democratic orientations.",TRUE,FALSE,citizenship|Democracy|democratic attitudes|illiberal democracy|political participation,2020-05-07T07:06:01.894896,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-07T07:05:48.896791,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,Carolin V.

One intervention, the reduction of industrial animal agriculture, could reduce both infectious and chronic diseases and improve the health of our planet.
