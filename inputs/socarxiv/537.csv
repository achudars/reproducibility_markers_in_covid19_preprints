However, there is little, if any, evidence to support this position. Recent research has suggested the creative and cultural occupations are dominated by those from professional or managerial backgrounds (O’Brien et al 2016, Oakley et al 2017), with cultural theorists arguing this reflects declining rates of social mobility over time (Banks 2017). This paper provides the first empirical assessment of claims made by policy and cultural theory concerning changing patterns of social mobility into cultural and creative occupations. We use the England and Wales Longitudinal Study, along with three birth cohort studies, to offer the first analysis of social mobility into cultural and creative occupations over time. We demonstrate that: cultural and creative occupations have always been characterised by overrepresentations of those from privileged social origins, with little evidence of a classless meritocracy; rates of absolute social mobility are declining in these occupations, contradicting policymakers’ faith in a ‘meritocracy’ for talented individuals aiming to work in artistic and cultural jobs; this decline in absolute levels of social mobility is in contrast to the stability in relative social mobility, indicating there was no ‘golden age’ for social mobility into cultural occupations. These three points illustrate the importance of occupational perspectives on cultural and creative industries and the value of sociological analysis for public policy questions in this area. In particular, the lack of social fluidity in the occupations producing culture is a key issue for future public policy intervention. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research on longevity of cultural careers and the importance of gender using the Longitudinal Study dataset.",TRUE,FALSE,cohorts|cultural and creative industries|culture|ons longitudinal study|social inequality|social mobility,2018-07-02T13:32:07.096063,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-27T15:07:34.262269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Orian Brook|Dave O'Brien|Mark Taylor,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/citation/,7njy3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ujdgy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/relationships/node/,ujdgy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aba44c073108a000d7f1efc/,5aba44c073108a000d7f1efc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7njy3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7njy3,NA

The teaching profession is filled with countless opportunities to enrich the academic lives of students. While some concepts and educational objectives will be easy for students to grasp, others will require creativity to ensure that important learning objectives are met. The teaching strategies used must therefore be in line with the contextual learning theory where the aim of education is the integration of content learnt with the real world experiences. Using audio/visual aids in teaching is one way to enhance lesson plans and give students additional ways to process subject information. Therefore, teaching tools such as interactive case studies, simulations and games, group work are widely recommended by several research organizations.
In the past, many activities of accounting professors were restricted or confined by their classroom walls. Today, numerous technological advancements in communication infrastructure, equipment and online tools greatly facilitate the initiatives that require effective teachings. Outside experts can now visit the classroom, students can explore or collaborate in distant places and professors can extend the geographical reach of their lessons simply via the means of digital video technology.
Presenting accountancy in student-centered and computer-based learning environments can demonstrate the practicality and necessity of the subject, particularly as a foundation for many career options.

This literature, however, has neglected an important measure of everyday religious practice, preference, and socialization: religious media consumption. We take a key social issue where attitudes have been shown to be largely shaped by religion—same-sex relationships—as an example to determine whether religious media consumption predicts social attitudes net of the measures typically included in the literature on religion and attitudes: affiliation, practice, and literalism. We draw on data from three national surveys, each of which contains different measures of religious media consumption and attitudes toward various same-sex relationships: the 1998 General Social Survey, 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, and 2012 Portraits of American Life Study. Both multivariate and propensity score matching analyses demonstrate that religious media consumption independently predicts lower support for same-sex relationships in all three surveys. We propose that religious media consumption is a key measure of religious practice, preference, and socialization that shapes Americans’ views toward social issues through both direct messages and by fortifying subcultural boundaries.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|media|propensity score matching|public opinion|religion|same-sex adoption|same-sex marriage|sexuality,2018-07-02T11:45:30.931289,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-27T02:27:49.490533,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|Arts and Humanities|Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/citation/,vr5df,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6qs4v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/relationships/node/,6qs4v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab967869f98940012c56142/,5ab967869f98940012c56142,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vr5df/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vr5df,https://doi.org/10.1177/2F2329496516686616

All past attempts to link the title of ""guest"" to dualistic churches in the West and East, or to the Catholic and Orthodox Church have failed and have no reliance on sources. It is certain that this is an original title inherent in Bosnian medieval spirituality, which probably would have to rely on early Christian practice of hospitality. This hypothesis was also suggested by some earlier researchers pointing to the equivalence of the term ""stranger"" and ""guest"" in the sources, also prominent in Old and New Testament abound with the many uses of these terms. Knowing that God in the Bible reveals Him through the incarnating Christ in a role of stranger or a guest in the homes of people, it is appropriate to assume that the concept of ""hospitality"", ""home"" (hiža) and ""hospitium"" (gostinjac) is of crucial importance within Bosnian Church's Christian mysticism. In accordance with the etymology of the title ""guests"" it is reasonable to assume that their ecclesial activity was closely related to the missionary activities of preaching and spreading the Word on one very high level which required the community to have a great respect for them. It is known that Christ identified with the guests, that the service to the guest was equalized with the service of Christ Himself, that the reward for hospitality to the guest was eternal life and that the inhospitality toward the guest meant the eternal punishment. The spiritual activity of the guests had to have an emphasis on the theology of affirmation so characteristic for Christian mysticism.

Recently, however, changes in marital fertility have also contributed to the decline in fertility. While the influence of women's educational attainment on fertility has only been paid attention, since fertility involves two partners and so it is also possible to focus on the influence of the male partner’s social status. Moreover, not only can each partner’s socioeconomic status, but also their combining as a couple (assortative mating), influence fertility. In spite of theoretical significance to examine the relationship between educational assortative mating and fertility, scholars face a methodological problem in examining an interaction of two variables. In this study, applying diagonal reference model to event history analysis, I estimated the effect of educational assortative mating on having first and second childbirth in Japan. A series of analysis revealed that homogamy couples of the high educated are less likely to have their second child than other types of educational coupling.",TRUE,FALSE,educational assortative mating|fertility|japan|paa2018,2018-07-02T11:45:30.153381,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-26T15:31:12.456729,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Fumiya Uchikoshi,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/citation/,p7hg8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/68mpw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/relationships/node/,68mpw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab8d15976e58c000ff975a5/,5ab8d15976e58c000ff975a5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7hg8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p7hg8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p7hg8,NA

Robust savings rate coupled with good capital mobilization are the key macro economic variables, which play a significant role in economic growth.  A nation's savings and investment propensities also play a key role in achieving dynamic stability in the capital market. Per Capita Income in India has been on the rise since all of the last decade. With growth in the PCI, savings and investment in the country too has shown a northbound movement. At the same time, there has been a phenomenal rise in the youth population. This has made India the youngest nation with a demographic dividend appearing to be a reality. This young work force is expected to drive the engine of growth. 
In Economics, investment is generally held to mean formation of capital. As such, from a pure economics point of view, the formation of physical assets is important when considering investment.  However this study focuses on what is referred to as Financial Investment i.e. investment in shares and securities aimed primarily at earning income rather than enhancing production. By virtue of this the words savings and investment come closer in meaning than traditionally seen. However a slight difference still remains which is that while savings is simply setting aside funds for future, investment also involves mobilizing them so that somebody else may use it for productive purposes.
This study examines the savings and investment pattern of select college going students (Age: 17-25 years) in the city of Mumbai who has just begun to earn.  The study also looks into the basic financial literacy amongst the youth; how they go about educating themselves, and how do they look at risk, returns and various modes of investments and what determines the same. Primary data was collected using a survey method. The information generated during data collection was both qualitative and quantitative. The major objectives of the study were (1) To understand the youngsters’ income and saving pattern. (2) To know their long-term financial goals. (3) To find out risk appetite of youngsters.  (4) To find out whether the young investors are looking for long term growth or risk or return or liquidity. 
The study finds that safety and security, which were always important reasons for investment, are still influential in determining the direction of investment. Respondents liked to keep multiple options while choosing their investment options. However, returns on investment were obviously the most considered factor followed by risk. Saving accounts in banks appears to be the most common way of saving and investing for the respondents. Mutual fund has gained the favor of young investors. Investment in mutual funds through the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a favored investment option for the youngsters. This is especially true of the young salaried class, which has just started earning and does not have a fat bank balance as yet. Youngsters today do know about the options available to them due to the rapid spread of information in recent times; they are not always sure about how to go about investing in newer ways actively. 
An informed investor is a good investor; there is opportunity for providing them with guidance and information but it has to be done in a way that is in accordance with their lifestyle – seminars and workshops are no longer the kind of options to peruse. Podcasts, online videos, forums and tutorials are the way of learning of the young generation. The social media platforms specially Face Book, Twitter, LinkedIn along with e-groups and websites can be a medium to spread awareness about various options available for the young investors. Thus, investor education can play a vital role in improving the active participation of the investors in the market, which can help them in the informed investment and in getting good returns.",TRUE,FALSE,investment pattern|savings|youth,2018-07-02T11:45:29.769503,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-26T15:30:24.434130,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,BSE,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/citation/,gb7as,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e76pq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/relationships/node/,e76pq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab8702376e58c000ef908d8/,5ab8702376e58c000ef908d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gb7as/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gb7as/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gb7as,NA

In this respect, our work, showing as it does the pervasiveness of eugenics independently from traditional ideological boundaries, represents a further contribution to the Eugenics in the Progressive era debate inaugurated by Thomas Leonard’s Illiberal Reformers: Race, Eugenics, and American Economics in the Progressive Era (2016). 

At the same time, this paper contributes to the strand of literature that deals with the economic elaboration of the idea of differential capacities for happiness, of which the works of Levy and Peart represent the most recent examples.

Randomized cluster sampling plan was used to sample 2186 secondary school students in their final school year with mean age of 18.6 years (SD = 0.7 years). The study employed the Child Sexual Abuse Questionnaire (Mohler-Kuo et al., 2014) consisting of multiple behavior-specific questions. The prevalence of CSA was analyzed separately for three clusters of CSA and gender. The self-reported lifetime prevalence of at least one form of CSA was 47.3% among girls and 22.0% among boys. The prevalence of noncontact forms of CSA was 40.6% among girls and 17.7% among boys. CSA with physical contact without penetration was reported by 30.2% girls and 11.6% boys. The prevalence of CSA with penetration was 5.6% among girls and 1.3% among boys. More than half of CSA occurred between 16-18 year of age in all three CSA cluster types. The severity of abuse was positively associated with the acquaintance with the perpetrator. Roughly 43-56% disclosed the abuse to another person. The majority of disclosed CSA was revealed to peers and partners. Negligible proportion of CSA instances were reported to the police. The results show that CSA is a widespread and considerably covert phenomenon within the population of Slovak late adolescents. Prevention activities should consider broad spectrum of CSA forms in order to counteract tendencies to associate CSA only with unwanted sexual intercourse.",TRUE,FALSE,child sexual abuse|disclosure|late adolescence|prevalence,2018-07-02T11:45:28.738467,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-25T20:25:55.821395,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/citation/,d8bg6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sxqgb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/relationships/node/,sxqgb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab7820eb3bdb5000ebb8cb7/,5ab7820eb3bdb5000ebb8cb7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8bg6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d8bg6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d8bg6,NA
