However, quantile regression models the conditional quantile function of y given x just as linear regression models the conditional mean function. This article’s contribution is twofold: First, it discusses potential consequences of methodological misconceptions and formulations of Petscher and Logan (2014)’s presentation by contrasting features of quantile regression and linear regression. Secondly, it reinforces the importance of correct understanding of quantile regression in empirical research by illustrating similarities and differences of various quantile regression estimators and linear regression using simulated data.",TRUE,FALSE,child development|heteroskedasticity|homoskedasticity|Monte carlo simulation|quantile regression|simulation study|Stata|unconditional quantile regression,2018-10-10T02:15:21.310956,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-10T02:14:47.065840,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Sebastian E.

Some ENGOs take on policing roles towards CSPs, whereas others form “Green Alliances” with corporations to enhance their CSPs. This paper takes a deep dive into CSPs, ENGOs, and communication problems associated with CSPs, namely, reporting inadequacies and greenwashing. Potential angles from which ENGOs can help foster or enhance corporate sustainability are then identified and examined.
This empirical study examines several factors to improve corporate sustainability through partnerships with ENGOs. From the survey results, the top areas in which ENGOs can influence CSPs are determined—these include external value creation and the identification and monitoring of corporate negative environmental impact. There is evidence found in support of a correlation between trust in ENGOs and the perceived effectiveness of Green Alliances.",TRUE,FALSE,corporate social responsibility (CSR)|corporate sustainability programs (CSP)|environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs)|Green Alliances|partnerships,2018-10-10T02:15:41.373616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-10T02:15:13.968136,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/citation/,26eq4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jzews/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/relationships/node/,jzews,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbccf040463cb0017cf5fc6/,5bbccf040463cb0017cf5fc6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26eq4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26eq4/,https://doi.org/10.1002/csr.1674,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26eq4

As such, media discourses surrounding transgender people who “pass” justify punishment for their deception through violence. In this chapter, Billard explores these tensions, challenging the application of the label “deception” by the social majority to those of marginal identities, particularly inconspicuous ones, as it serves to delegitimate authentic identities and police the boundaries of social hierarchies.",TRUE,FALSE,deception|identity|passing|transgender|violence,2018-10-09T12:54:05.829433,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-09T12:53:18.512207,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cc6|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cc8|Arts and Humanities|Rhetoric and Composition|Rhetoric|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Speech and Rhetorical Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment",Palgrave,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/citation/,rxpwn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n7s83/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/relationships/node/,n7s83,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbc17c60463cb0018cc0465/,5bbc17c60463cb0018cc0465,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rxpwn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rxpwn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rxpwn

By examining the relationship between own socioeconomic position, parental socioeconomic position, and allostatic load in a representative sample of the British population, we test this hypothesis.
Methods: Our study uses cross-sectional data from 9,851 adult participants of waves 2 and 3 of Understanding Society.  The relationship between parental occupational class at age 14, respondents’ social class at the time of the interview, and allostatic load (AL) is explored by means of diagonal reference models (DRM), which allow us to disentangle the effects of parental social class, own social class, and the mobility process.  The AL score comprises the biomarkers 1) total cholesterol, 2) HDL cholesterol, 3) triglycerides, 4) glycated haemoglobin, 5) C-reactive protein, 6) fibrinogen, 7) systolic blood pressure, 8) diastolic blood pressure, 9) resting heart rate, 10) BMI, and 11) waist circumference.
Results: AL is particularly high among the stable working class and low among the stable upper class. On average, current class and origin class exert about equal weight on current AL. However, social mobility—regardless of whether upwards or downwards—is not detrimental for AL. Further, we find evidence that class of origin may be less important among those outside the labor market for reasons other than retirement.
Conclusion: Both own social class and parental social class influence AL to a similar extent. However, we find no evidence that mobility trajectories exert any effects, good or bad, on allostatic load.",TRUE,FALSE,allostatic load|Diagonal mobility models|Diagonal reference models|Intergenerational mobility|Mobility effects|social class|Social mobility|Socioeconomic position|Understanding Society,2018-10-08T18:34:45.748640,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-08T18:34:17.949012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",The authors,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/citation/,63arn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6fuyj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/relationships/node/,6fuyj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbb6e02cbf33d0016b3212b/,5bbb6e02cbf33d0016b3212b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63arn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/63arn/,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2017-210171,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/63arn

We combine this research with behavior genetics to show that societal variation in mobility is rooted in family advantages that siblings share over and above genetic transmission. In societies with high intergenerational mobility, less variance in educational attainment is attributable to the shared sibling environment. Variance due to genetic factors is largely constant, but its share as a part of total variance, heritability, rises with mobility. Our results suggest that environmental differences underlie variation in intergenerational mobility, and that there is no tension between egalitarian policies and the realization of individual genetic potential.",TRUE,FALSE,behavior genetics|education|educational attainment|genetics|heritability|intergenerational mobility|nature and nurture|parental education|Scarr-Rowe hypothesis|social mobility|stratification,2018-10-07T15:00:41.654460,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-07T15:00:28.989859,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/citation/,yeq68,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c549j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/relationships/node/,c549j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bb9f22dcbf33d0016b1e439/,5bb9f22dcbf33d0016b1e439,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yeq68/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yeq68/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yeq68

Participation on the part of community residents as volunteers and voters are indispensable to the success of these initiatives. Therefore, grassroots state agents are eager to solicit involvement from those susceptible to their mobilization, including Communist Party members. In this article, we intend to investigate the role of Party members in community volunteering and voting and its differentiation across various social groups and neighborhood contexts. Drawing on nationally representative data, we find that Party members indeed have a stronger propensity to participate than the non- member residents. The effect of Party membership is statistically significant on volunteering but not on voting, and more distinguishable among employed than retired residents. In danwei neighborhoods, the direction of Party membership’s influence is reversed. These findings shed some light on the targets, emphasis, channels and constraints of Party-state’s grassroots mobilization in its quest of maintaining legitimacy in a cost-effective way.",TRUE,FALSE,community building|neighborhood context|party membership|social participation,2018-10-07T14:59:45.283911,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-07T14:59:15.642000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/citation/,6khja,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k6uab/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/relationships/node/,k6uab,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bb99e4d0463cb001aca2ab0/,5bb99e4d0463cb001aca2ab0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6khja/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6khja/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6khja
