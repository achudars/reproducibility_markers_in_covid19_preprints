Historically, Open Innovation Communities (OICs), such as those who make 
free and open source software (FOSS), have opted out of the patent 
system for three main reasons: Patents are expensive to acquire and 
enforce; they are philosophically, culturally, and politically anathema 
to many OIC members; and even when they appear to be acquired for 
“defensive” or other altruistic purposes, there has been no guarantee 
against someone later “weaponizing” them for use in an offensive attack.

In this article, we first analyze how and why various OICs have 
approached strategic concerns about intellectual property and then make 
a case for why OICs should – and indeed must – opt back into the patent 
system if they wish to protect themselves from the growing threats that 
patents pose, including threats from the increasingly complex “thicket” 
of patents on software, standards, and ecosystems that have become the 
battlegrounds over technologies such as smartphones, online video, and 
social media. We support our argument with a proposal for a new OIC 
patent license – the Defensive Patent License. Built on legal and 
normative approaches similar to the GNU General Public License and 
Creative Commons licensing, the DPL directly addresses the three reasons 
for OIC opt-out and provides several positive reasons for opting in, 
including increasing access and interoperability between OIC 
technologies, improving the prior art, imposing legally-binding 
restrictions that require DPL patents to remain “defensive,” and 
preventing patent trolls, “bullies,” or others from ever asserting DPL 
patents against those who use the license. We end with a comparison of 
the DPL to other OIC patent strategies to situate it within the current 
set of options OICs face in dealing with patent threats.

Most Americans have not heard of 'Do Not Track,' a proposal to allow 
Internet users to exercise more control over online advertising. 
However, when probed, most prefer that Do Not Track block advertisers 
from collecting data about their online activities. This is a much more 
privacy-protective approach for Do Not Track than what has been proposed 
by the advertising industry.

In previous studies, we have found that Americans think they are 
protected by strong online privacy laws. Here, we probed beliefs about 
tracking on medical websites and 'free' websites, with most not able to 
answer true/false questions correctly about tracking. This result brings 
into question notice-and-choice models that depend on consumer 
understanding of the terms for their legitimacy.

We also probed Internet users' attitudes towards advertising. Most 
Internet users say that they do not find utility in online advertising, 
with half claiming that they never click on ads.

Advertisers and consumers are at an impasse on privacy. Advertisers seem 
to be seeking a kind of total information awareness for behavioral 
advertising, and have proposed self-regulatory guidelines with little 
bite. At the same time, both our survey evidence and media reports show 
consumer opposition to tracking.

Do Not Track has emerged from the current skirmish between consumers and 
advertisers, but it is a relatively modest intervention that does little 
to shift the underlying incentives that have driven increasing tracking 
and aggregation of information about consumers. It is foreseeable that 
regardless of the form Do Not Track takes, websites will simply require 
consumers to disable it in order to access content. A fundamental change 
in incentives may be necessary to relieve this impasse and find an 
approach for advertising that is not so dependent upon third-party 
tracking and aggregation of information, both online and off.

Mobile phones are a rich source of personal information about 
individuals. Both private and public sector actors seek to collect this 
information. Facebook, among other companies, recently ignited a 
controversy by collecting contact lists from users’ mobile phones via 
its mobile app. A recent Congressional investigation found that law 
enforcement agencies sought access to wireless phone records over one 
million times in 2011. As these developments receive greater attention 
in the media, a public policy debate has started concerning the 
collection and use of information by private and public actors.

To inform this debate and to better understand Americans’ attitudes 
towards privacy in data generated by or stored on mobile phones, we 
commissioned a nationwide, telephonic (both wireline and wireless) 
survey of 1,200 households focusing upon mobile privacy issues.

We found that Americans overwhelmingly consider information stored on 
their mobile phones to be private — at least as private as information 
stored on their home computers. They also overwhelmingly reject several 
types of data collection and use drawn from current business practices. 
Specifically, large majorities reject the collection of contact lists 
stored on the phone for the purposes of tailoring social network 
“friend” suggestions and providing coupons, the collection of location 
data for tailoring ads, and the use of wireless contact information for 
telemarketing, even where there is a business relationship between the 
consumer and merchant.

Respondents evinced strong support for substantial limitations on the 
retention of wireless phone usage data. Respondents also thought that 
some prior court oversight is appropriate when police seek to search a 
wireless phone when arresting an individual.

insulates managers of corporations from shareholders’ claims that it deems

inverse of Polanyi’s observation that society protects itself from markets
is also true: the state creates market boundaries so that “always embedded”

Payment systems that allow people to pay using their mobile phones are 
promised to reduce transaction fees, increase convenience, and enhance 
payment security. New mobile payment systems also are likely to make it 
easier for businesses to identify consumers, to collect more information 
about consumers, and to share more information about consumers’ 
purchases among more businesses. While many studies have reported 
security concerns as a barrier to adoption of mobile payment 
technologies, the privacy implications of these technologies have been 
under examined. To better understand Americans’ attitudes towards 
privacy in new transaction systems, we commissioned a nationwide, 
telephonic (wireline and wireless) survey of 1,200 households, focusing 
upon the ways that mobile payment systems are likely to share 
information about consumers’ purchases.

We found that Americans overwhelmingly oppose the revelation of contact 
information (phone number, email address, and home address) to merchants 
when making purchases with mobile payment systems. Furthermore, an even 
higher level of opposition exists to systems that track consumers’ 
movements through their mobile phones.

We explain some advantages of mobile payment systems, some challenges to 
their adoption in the United States, and then turn to our main finding: 
Americans overwhelming reject mobile payment systems that track their 
movements or share identification information with retailers. We then 
suggest a possible remedy for such information sharing: adapting 
provisions of California’s Song-Beverly Credit Card Act, which prohibits 
merchants from requesting personal information at the register when a 
consumer pays with a credit card, to mobile payments systems. Our survey 
results suggest that consumers would support limitations on information 
collection and transfer. Song-Beverly could be adopted to accommodate 
those who wish to share their transaction data.

Alan Westin’s well-known and often-used privacy segmentation fails to 
describe privacy markets or consumer choices accurately. The 
segmentation divides survey respondents into “privacy fundamentalists,” 
“privacy pragmatists,” and the “privacy unconcerned.” It describes the 
average consumer as a “privacy pragmatist” who influences market 
offerings by weighing the costs and benefits of services and making 
choices consistent with his or her privacy preferences. Yet, Westin’s 
segmentation methods cannot establish that users are pragmatic in theory 
or in practice. Textual analysis reveals that the segmentation fails 
theoretically. Original survey data suggests that, in practice, most 
consumers are not aware of privacy rules and practices, and make 
decisions in the marketplace with a flawed, yet optimistic, perception 
of protections. Instead of acting as “privacy pragmatists,” consumers 
experience a marketplace myopia that causes them to believe that they 
need not engage in privacy analysis of products and services.

Westin’s work has been used to justify a regulatory system where the 
burden of taking action to protect privacy rests on the very individuals 
who think it is already protected strongly by law. Our findings begin to 
suggest reasons behind both the growth of some information-intensive 
marketplace activities and some prominent examples of consumer backlash.

Based on knowledge-testing and attitudinal survey work, we suggest that 
Westin’s approach actually segments two recognizable privacy groups: the 
“privacy resilient” and the “privacy vulnerable.” We then trace the 
contours of a more usable segmentation and consider whether privacy 
segmentations contribute usefully to political discourse on privacy.

interpretation of the basic terms at issue — especially ""license"" and 
""sale"" — affected nearly every American recording artist signed to a 
major record label, including many members of amicus Motown Alumni 
Association. For example, one agreement between Motown Records and The 
Temptations drew exactly the same distinction in its royalty structure 
between records sold and recordings that were licensed to third parties.

During the proceedings below, the District Court failed to give adequate 
consideration to the broader context of the contractual terms at issue 
and the role they play in the music industry. In this appeal, amicus 
urged the Court not to make the same mistakes and, in particular, to 
consider three key factual and legal aspects of the music industry that 
are relevant to resolving the dispute: (1) the major labels’ frequent 
and repeated use of strained contractual interpretations, abstruse 
royalty structures, and strategic accounting practices to deny artists 
proper notice and fair compensation, including the historical failure to 
pay out accurate royalties earned under artist contracts; (2) the 
incentives record labels have to contort contractual terms in order to 
avoid paying higher “license” royalties to artists, given their changing 
role in a music market rapidly shifting to digital distribution; and (3) 
the specific context and meaning of common copyright terms such as 
“license” and “sale” in the federal Copyright Act.

In light of these considerations, amicus urged the Court to adopt a 
strong presumption that when music contracts conveying copyright 
interests use terms derived from within the Copyright Act, such as 
""license"" or ""sale,"" the Act's default terminology should apply, and 
only in rare cases where there is substantial evidence that the parties 
unambiguously agreed to deviate from these common statutory meanings 
should these terms be susceptible to different interpretations. This 
practice comports with well-settled principles of contract law, the 
proper allocation of risks in recording contracts, and the reasonable 
expectations of artists, enabling them to rely on common industry 
understandings and the plain meaning of the terms, regardless of changes 
over time in technology, distribution methods, or the labels' business 
models.

Homo economicus reliably makes an appearance in regulatory debates 
concerning information privacy. Under the still-dominant U.S. “notice 
and choice” approach to consumer information privacy, the rational 
consumer is expected to negotiate for privacy protection by reading 
privacy policies and selecting services consistent with her preferences. 
A longstanding model for predicting these preferences is Professor Alan 
Westin's well-known segmentation of consumers into “privacy 
pragmatists,” “privacy fundamentalists,” and “privacy unconcerned.”

To be tenable as a protection for consumer interest, “notice and choice” 
requires homo economicus to be broadly reliable as a model. Consumers 
behaving according to the model will know what they want and how to get 
it in the marketplace, limiting regulatory approaches to information 
privacy. While notice and choice is undergoing strong theoretical, 
empirical, and political critique, U.S. Internet privacy law largely 
reflects these assumptions.

This Article contributes to the ongoing debate about notice and choice 
in two main ways. First, we consider the legacy Westin's privacy 
segmentation model itself, which as greatly influenced the development 
of the notice-and-choice regime. Second, we report on original survey 
research, collected over four years, exploring Americans’ knowledge, 
preferences, and attitudes about a wide variety of data practices in 
online and mobile markets. Using these methods, we engage in considered 
textual analysis, empirical testing, and critique of Westin’s 
segmentation model.

Our work both calls into question longstanding assumptions used by 
Westin and lends new insight into consumers’ privacy knowledge and 
preferences. A close textual look at factual and theoretical assumptions 
embedded in the segmentation model shows foundational flaws. With 
testing, we find that the segmentation model lacks validity in important 
dimensions. In analyzing data from nationwide, telephonic surveys of 
Internet and mobile phone users, we find an apparent knowledge gap among 
consumers concerning business practices and legal protections for 
privacy, calling into question Westin’s conclusion that a majority of 
consumers act pragmatically. We further find that those categorized as 
“privacy pragmatists” act differently from Westin’s model when directly 
presented with the value exchange — and thus the privacy tradeoff — 
offered with these services.

These findings reframe the privacy pragmatist and call her influential 
status in U.S. research, industry practice, and policy into serious 
question. Under the new view, she cannot be seen as “pragmatic” at all, 
but rather as a consumer making choices in the marketplace with 
substantial deficits in her understanding of business practices. This 
likewise calls into question policy decisions based on the segmentation 
model and its assumptions. We conclude that updated research and a 
policy approach that addresses both rationality and knowledge gaps are key.
