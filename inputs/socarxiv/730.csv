These cases not only tread the line between fact and original expression, but underscore the difficulty of separating process from product in copyright.

provisions to the Indian copyright law with the objective of providing
“adequate” protection for copyrighted material in the online digital
environment. Film industry was one of the biggest lobbying groups behind
the new DRM provisions in India, and the industry has been consistently
trying to portray online piracy as a major threat. The Indian film industry
also extensively uses John Doe orders from the high courts in India to
prevent the access of Internet users to websites suspected to be hosting
pirated material. This paper explores two questions in the context of the
new DRM provisions in India: (1) Is online piracy a threat to the
Indian film industry? and (2) Are the present measures taken by the film
industry the optimal measures for addressing the issue of online piracy?
Based on data from an extensive empirical survey conducted in India, this
paper questions the claims of the industry that online piracy is at a
substantial level in India. The Internet usage related data in India also
support the findings from the empirical survey. However, the paper observes
that pirated Indian movie content is abundant in the Internet and this
shows the existence of strong demand for those content. Based on a careful
analysis of different websites hosting pirated Indian movies, the paper
illustrates that the most probable consumers of those pirated
movies are the millions of (potential) consumers residing abroad. The paper
argues that the enactment of DRM provisions under Indian copyright law or
wide sweeping John Doe orders may never be a solution for such piracy.
Piracy of Indian movie content abroad is primarily attributable to the
failure of the Indian film industry to explore innovative business models
to reach (potential) consumers abroad. The paper argues that the Indian
film industry may achieve sustainable solutions for online piracy only by
making the legitimate products reach those consumers.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:30.570330,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T02:06:41.554000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/citation/,cz32p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96cc6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/relationships/node/,96cc6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578996b29ad5a101f3f5c3d7/,578996b29ad5a101f3f5c3d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cz32p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cz32p

He reads the two processes against each other as a prelude to recommending Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reform. The amendment to FOIA that Professor Levine proposes would open the international IP policymaking process to greater public scrutiny by creating a qualified public right to ""foreign relations"" national security information, which was systematically withheld from the public during the ACTA negotiations. This article, prepared for the Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal's 2012 Symposium, ""Piracy and the Politics of Policing: Legislating and Enforcing Copyright Law,"" is a response to Professor Levine that draws on Jürgen Habermas' discourse theory of procedural democracy to examine the policymaking dynamics of ACTA and SOPA/PIPA and to assess the democracy-enhancing potential of the FOIA reform Professor Levine proposes.

The most widely publicized form of graduated response is a ""three strikes and you're out"" model, in which a user's Internet access is suspended or terminated by his or her ISP following that user's receipt of three successive notices of copyright infringement. As it has been presented by entertainment industry trade groups, the enforcement paradigm embodied in graduated response forgoes litigation and statutory mandates in favor of voluntary cooperation between rights owners and Internet access providers - parties that have long been at loggerheads with each other in the war on piracy.

This article seeks to explain, in the context of evolving network management technology and its impact on intermediary liability rules, why the time may be ripe for broadband providers and corporate rights owners to renegotiate their respective roles in the project of online copyright enforcement. Following an analysis of the turn to private ordering and technology-based mechanisms for policing copyrights online, this article proposes a set of principles to guide the implementation of graduated response regimes so that consumers, who have come to rely on uninterrupted Internet access for everything from banking to blogging, do not fall victim to immature filtering technologies and overzealous enforcement.

But the literature on knowledge production has to date recognized only in passing the role of intellectual property in this process. This paper applies the insights of knowledge production to the features of intellectual property regimes, both to flesh out the analysis of tacit knowledge codification, and to illuminate the role of intellectual property in the firm.  Patents, for example, constitute an explicitly codified form of technical knowledge, providing a stable common code for technical know-how, partially ameliorating the risks associated with loss of tacit knowledge. Codification through the patent system also provides important stability to attendant tacit knowledge. Patent doctrines regarding prior art, interference practice, and infringement all address the balance of tacit and codified knowledge. By functioning as a codification mechanism, patents may facilitate employee movement and entrepreneurial business spin-offs. Thus, aside from the usual justifications for patents in terms of incentive or disclosure, patenting may help to secure knowledge against loss or dissipation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,codification|knowledge management|patent|Preprint|socarxiv|tacit knowledge,2018-07-02T10:53:45.783670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T23:48:03.392000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/citation/,vuh9d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9rb37/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/relationships/node/,9rb37,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578976369ad5a101f2f5c3a3/,578976369ad5a101f2f5c3a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuh9d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vuh9d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vuh9d

In the United States, the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that shield Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from secondary copyright liability, are concomitantly available only to ISPs that lack the common law knowledge prerequisites for such liability. But this leads to the question of when a juridical corporate entity can be said to have 'knowledge' under the statute. Legal institutions have well-established processes for inferring the knowledge state of natural persons, but corporations are complex sociotechnical networks of human and non-human elements whose information state does not map well onto such inferential methods. This question is of course not unique to copyright liability; corporate entities may be responsible for 'knowing' actions under a variety of applicable legal provisions, and the question of corporate knowledge is generally under theorized. But consideration of ISP 'knowledge' in this context points the way to consideration of corporate epistemology that must be foundational to determining corporate responsibility in copyright protection.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,agency|attribution|contributory infringement|copyright|corporations|cyberlaw|DMCA|infringement|Internet Service Providers|ISP|knowledge|master servant doctrine|Preprint|respondeat superior|safe harbor|socarxiv|vicarious liability,2018-07-02T10:46:27.651086,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T23:37:55.424000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/citation/,69wpy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4482u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/relationships/node/,4482u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578973dc6c613b01f0347c48/,578973dc6c613b01f0347c48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69wpy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69wpy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69wpy

Association for Molecular Pathology, the United States Supreme Court will consider the patentability of human genes under the ""product of nature"" doctrine. Patentable subject matter is generally held to encompass materials and artifacts created by humans, and not that which exists independently in nature. However, it is not clear that this is a meaningful or helpful distinction. Given on one hand that the concept of a gene is a human construct, and on the other hand that all human creations are drawn from the material environment, the question of gene patenting is better addressed as a matter of innovation policy than of imponderable labeling.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:44.145406,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T23:24:04.329000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/citation/,uz84v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3j73y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/relationships/node/,3j73y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57897096594d9001f1859f29/,57897096594d9001f1859f29,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz84v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uz84v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uz84v
