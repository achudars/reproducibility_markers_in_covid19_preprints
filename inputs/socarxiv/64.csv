By investigating the practicalities of meeting these targets from an educator's perspective, this article proceeds with: arguing for a need to shift the central purpose of education; examining what is meant by education ‘for’ the three key areas included in the global indicator framework; exploring curricular opportunities offered by the SDGs; and presenting inquiry-based learning as a pedagogical approach for critically interrogating the SDGs with learners.

Social Patterns in Reliance on Automatic and Deliberate Cognition,"Sociologists increasingly use insights from dual-process models to explain how people think and act. These discussions generally emphasize the influence of cultural knowledge mobilized through automatic cognition, or else show how the use of automatic and deliberate processes vary according to the task at hand or the context. Drawing on insights from sociological theory and suggestive research from social and cognitive psychology, we argue that socially structured experiences also shape general, individual-level preferences (or propensities) for automatic and deliberate thinking. Using a meta-analysis of 63 psychological studies (N=25,074) and a new multivariate analysis of nationally representative data, we test the hypothesis that the use automatic and deliberate cognitive processes is socially patterned. We find that education consistently predicts preferences for deliberate processing and that gender predicts preferences for both automatic and deliberate processing. We find that age is a significant but likely non-linear predictor of preferences for automatic and deliberate cognition, and weaker evidence for differences by income, marital status, and religion. These results underscore the need to consider group differences in cognitive processing in sociological explanations of culture, action, and inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,action|cognition|cognitive styles|culture|dual-process models,2021-03-13T18:17:20.944042,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-13T18:16:55.400963,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Sociological Science,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/citation/,8qpuc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604cc025b57c9c013680d2ea/,604cc025b57c9c013680d2ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qpuc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8qpuc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8qpuc

This study leverages SDI data to model social distancing behaviour with time-series COVID-19 data, as well as an array of political and economic variables. The central aim of this study is to examine three hypotheses: (i) COVID-19 outbreaks within a state will induce social distancing by fear of the virus, (ii) states with more low-income workers will engage in less social distancing due to the nature of essential work, and (iii) political beliefs will influence social distancing behaviour, through the public debate over social distancing policy and a partisan logic defining state stay-at-home orders. We use Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Beta Regression models to determine the most influential variables in this study. VAR models for time-series relationships between cases and social distancing behaviour in California and Texas, and corresponding Granger-Cause Test results, are investigated through case studies. Significant Beta model variables influencing social distancing behaviour are closely examined through visual data analysis and qualitatively contextualized to describe relationships present in the data. Our results indicate statistically significant relationships between the severity of state outbreaks, age and income distribution, change in governor approval ratings, and social distancing behaviour. There are also clear relationships between the partisan make-up of a state and social distancing behaviour.

regarding its overall costs and benefits is mixed. To test the possibility that overconfidence might
yield important relative benefits that offset its absolute costs, we conducted an experiment (N=298
university students) in which pairs of participants bargain over the unequal allocation of a prize
that was earned via a joint effort. We manipulated confidence using a binary noisy signal to
investigate the causal effect of negotiators’ beliefs about their relative contribution on the outcome
of the negotiation. Our results provide evidence that high levels of confidence lead to relative
benefits (how much one earns compared to one’s partner) but absolute costs (how much money
one receives overall). These results suggest that overconfidence creates an inefficient equilibrium

New policies in high income countries (HICs) have responded to anecdotal evidence that many struggle to meet their menstrual health needs. Qualitative research has explored lived experiences of menstruating in HICs and can inform intervention approaches. 
Methods and findings: Primary, qualitative studies capturing experiences of menstruation in HICs were eligible for inclusion. Systematic database and hand searching identified 11485 records. Following screening and quality appraisal using the EPPI-Centre checklist, 104 studies (120 publications) detailing the menstrual experiences of over 3800 individuals across sixteen countries were included. We used the integrated model of menstrual experiences developed from studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as a starting framework and deductively and inductively identified antecedents contributing to menstrual experiences; menstrual experiences themselves and impacts of menstrual experiences. 
Included studies described consistent themes and relationships that fit well with the LMIC integrated model, with modifications to themes and model pathways identified through our analysis. The socio-cultural context heavily shaped menstrual experiences, manifesting in strict behavioural expectations to conceal menstruation and limiting the provision of menstrual materials. Resource limitations contributed to negative experiences, where dissatisfaction with menstrual practices and management environments were expressed along with feelings of disgust if participants felt they failed to manage their menstruation in a discrete, hygienic way. Physical menstrual factors such as pain were commonly associated with negative experiences, with mixed experiences of healthcare reported. Across studies participants described negative impacts of their menstrual experience including increased mental burden and detrimental impacts on participation and personal relationships. Positive experiences were more rarely reported, although relationships between cis-women were sometimes strengthened by shared experiences of menstrual bleeding. 
Included studies reflected a broad range of disciplines and epistemologies. Many aimed to understand the constructed meanings of menstruation, but few were explicitly designed to inform policy or practice. Few studies focused on socioeconomically disadvantaged groups relevant to new policy efforts.
Conclusions: We developed an integrated model of menstrual experience in HICs which can be used to inform research, policy and practice decisions by emphasising the pathways through which positive and negative menstrual experiences manifest

However, less work explores the experiences of young people from racialised backgrounds as they navigate the pandemic, and the specific consequences this has for their mental health.  Forty young people (age 16-25) from black, mixed and other minority backgrounds and living in London, participated in consecutive focus group discussions over a two-month period, to explore the impact of the pandemic on their lives and emotional wellbeing. Thematic analysis identified seven categories describing the impact of the pandemic, indicating: deepening of existing socioeconomic and emotional challenges; efforts to navigate racism and difference within the response; and survival strategies drawing on communal and individual resources. Young people also articulated visions for a future public health response which addressed gaps in current strategies.

Despite the consistency of this observation, the timing of within-individual changes in criminal justice contact in relation to TBI remains under-investigated.  For example, previous studies have primarily considered TBI as a causal influence of later criminal justice contact.  However, TBI may also serve as a consequence of criminal justice contact or a criminogenic lifestyle.  The current study simultaneously observes both possibilities by examining criminal justice contact before, around the time of, and after the first reported TBI.  
Methods: Drawing from a combination of self-report and lifetime official record data from a jail cohort admitted between February 2017 and September 2017 and who sustained their first reported TBI at age 21 or older (N = 531), the current study examines jail admissions in the 24 months before and 24 months after the first reported TBI and across eight biannual intervals (N = 4,248 person-periods).  
Results: Any and misdemeanor admissions slightly increased pre-TBI and continued to increase around the time of and following TBI, never returning to pre-TBI levels.  Felony admissions decreased around the time of injury and increased post-TBI.  The introduction of a comparison group further solidified these findings.

At the end of interviews, we asked participants to reflect on their motivations for agreeing or declining to share their data. The vast majority of respondents consented to data sharing and reported that helping others was a primary motivation for agreeing to share their data.

Previous research suggests that relevant risk behaviors for school injuries, risk-taking and aggression, are highly susceptible to peer effects. Specifically, evidence suggests that the ratio of males and females in peer groups (sex ratio) affects individuals’ propensity for aggression and risk-taking. However, research so far has ignored potential associations of classroom sex ratios with adolescent school injury risks. In this paper, we investigate the association of classroom sex compositions with adolescent school injuries in a longitudinal survey dataset containing 13,131 observations from 9,204 adolescent students (ages 13-16) from secondary schools in Germany. The data also allow us to identify injuries that were due to aggressive behavior and analyze these injuries in detail. Results from multilevel logistic regression models reveal that adolescent students’ risk for school injuries is significantly and positively associated with male-skewed classroom sex ratios. Moreover, we find an even stronger positive association between male-dominated classrooms and aggression-injury risks. Finally, we find that both boys’ and girls’ injury risks equally increase with a higher proportion of males in their classroom. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to the sex ratio literature and potential interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescent health|peer effects|School injury|sex composition|sex ratio,2021-03-12T18:27:42.194630,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-12T18:27:18.653368,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/citation/,nfcv4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hax3u/,hax3u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604b956336e58b0115bbdda5/,604b956336e58b0115bbdda5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfcv4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nfcv4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nfcv4
