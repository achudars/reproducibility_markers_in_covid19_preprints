In its inception in the late 1970s, RJ was conceptualized and developed as an alternative to formal criminal justice practices. Since this time, however, RJ has largely moved from being an alternative to criminal justice practices to an ‘alternative’ practice within criminal justice systems. This institutionalization has resulted in the significant growth of RJ practices, but has also resulted in RJ being used for criminal justice system goals that are at odds with the needs of victims or offenders. This paper examines the use of the Youth Justice Group Conferencing Program in Victoria, Australia. Drawing from interviews with conference conveners, our research highlights problems related to administrative ‘constraints’ and ‘co-options’ in conferencing in terms of referrals, preparation of conference participants, and victim participation. Following presentation of findings, we conclude
with a discussion of implications for the use of RJ within a highly institutionalized setting.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|criminal justice|criminology|institutionalisation|restorative justice|youth justice,2018-07-02T11:16:46.736411,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T22:50:03.299649,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Contemporary Justice Review,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/citation/,qsm6d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kx3yu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/relationships/node/,kx3yu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e5368c594d9002b1c75f69/,59e5368c594d9002b1c75f69,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qsm6d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qsm6d/,https://doi.org/10.1080/10282580.2017.1311194,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qsm6d

Unheard Voices from the Classroom,"Over the last two decades there has been an upsurge in the voices among TESOL/applied linguistics scholars calling for the teaching of English as an International (EIL) and Lingua Franca (ELF) language as opposed to the mainstream Standard English (MSE). These calls seem to be rather theoretical than empirical intellectual debates among those scholars without taking on board the voices of English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers and learners themselves as stakeholders. Focusing on a Sudanese EFL context, the present study therefore duly aims at empirically contributing to this intellectual debate by involving those stakeholders in the debate and by offering a reconciliatory third way forward. The study attempts to address two main research questions: (i) what kind of English(es) do Sudanese EFL teachers and learners want to teach, learn and identify with? And (ii) how do they view EIL and ELF language and to what extent are they willing to teach and learn this variety in the classroom? The study adopted a qualitative interview-based methodology and thirteen EFL teachers and learners took part in the investigation by allowing face-to-face interviews. Results of data analysis showed that both teachers and learners reportedly prefer to teach, learn and identify with the mainstream Standard English. They also showed unawareness of EIL/ELF as an emerging and competing variety to the MSE. Teachers and learners also reported varied views towards the potentials of teaching and learning EIL/ELF in the classroom.

Improving English language proficiency and skills among newly admitted university students is also a major objective of these programs. However, PYP programs do not achieve much outside the ordinary to set students on the road to the university. In particular, low-level English language proficiency and poor language skills are still apparent among most PYP students. Hence, this study is an attempt to conceptualize some of the challenges and obstacles faced by both English as a foreign language(EFL) teachers and students at the PYP program at a Saudi university. The study then develops a paradigm that can improve EFL practices and pedagogies within similar PYP programs. A number of 48 EFL teachers within the PYP program participated in the study, and then challenges were categorized into six subcategories relevant to the context of the study. Teacher participants' feedback was formulated into a developmental paradigm. The study used a questionnaire with open-ended questions.

Whilst ideologically young Malaysians can pick and choose where they want to learn, these schools are clustered around ethnicity, language and even religion. Only the majority national schools (or sekolah kebangsaan) reflect the diversity of the ideological Malaysian ‘race’ (or bangsa Malaysia). For national type schools (or sekolah jenis kebangsaan), these are almost exclusively subscribed by Tamil speaking students who are mostly Indians or by Mandarin speaking students who are mostly Chinese. The focus of this empirical paper is on a final school type, national religious schools (or sekolah kebangsaan agama), that represents the religious ideology of the Malaysian majority race, the Malay-Muslims. These are primary and secondary ‘Islamic schools’ that place heavy emphasis on Islamic education often through the medium of Arabic, for the Malay-Muslim majority in Malaysia. This paper focuses on the lived experiences of 30 first year university undergraduates who completed five to six years of secondary education in national religious schools. Data were collected from periodic focus group discussions and also written narrative ‘reflections’ of their Islamic school days with three cohorts of selected undergraduates from March 2016 to May 2017 at two university campuses in northern Malaysia.

At the syllabic and prosodic level, mechanisms like cluster simplification, syllabic consonant conversion, gemination, etc. are found at work and by far systematic in MSA borrowings.

Thus, the main research question focuses on the perceived English language needs of the learners at Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB), and the study involves an investigation into the mismatch between the Cutting Edge course book and the needs of PSAB students. A total of 70 students from different technical sections at Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB), Saudi Arabia participated in the study. Two types of data collection methods were used in this study: quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (interviews). The results obtained reveal that the current course book being used at PSAB does not meet their needs because the activities provided are not relevant to the specific context of their field, which is mainly military and aviation. Finding and adapting a textbook that is clearly linked to these students’ needs and to the course objectives is suggested as one possible solution. In the context of PSAB, data from the interviews and surveys shows the need to assess the content of the course book in relation to the needs of the learners. It also indicates the strong demand of the students for supplementary materials that provide linguistic input to match their needs.

A number of studies have supported the use of STAD in different subject areas and in different socio-cultural contexts. However, it is still an under-researched area in countries like Saudi Arabia where English is taught as a Foreign Language. This quasi-experimental study was conducted in Unaizah Community College, Saudi Arabia. Both the experimental group and the control group were tested on 2000-word vocabulary test. A vocabulary test was prepared and administered by the researchers at the beginning of the experiment as a pre-test. The experimental group was taught with Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD) strategy whereas the control group was taught with traditional whole-class instruction method. The treatment was carried out for two weeks. At the end of the experiment, the same vocabulary test was re-administered as a post-test. Independent samples t-test was used to analyze the data using SPSS 21. Results showed that there was a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group in favor of the experimental group (p= 0.002 &lt; 0.05).",TRUE,FALSE,Cooperative learning|EFL learners|STAD|vocabulary learning,2018-07-02T11:15:54.328196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T02:12:26.005205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/citation/,cya9b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zabqt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/relationships/node/,zabqt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e4142f594d9002b2c584c4/,59e4142f594d9002b2c584c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cya9b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cya9b/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.23,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cya9b

The present paper addresses a major feature of gender depiction in the Moroccan English as a Foreign Language (EFL) textbooks officially approved by the Ministry of Education and compulsory for high school students. Adopting a feminist theoretical approach, the study has quantitatively and qualitatively processed the gendered dialogues along with the related illustrations embedded in four EFL Moroccan textbooks, in addition to the gender roles assumed throughout different contexts (occupational/family roles, interests, activities). The textbooks were selected on the basis of their common themes and the different publication dates, starting from 1990 to 2005. The main aim is to see whether the English textbook designers adopt a gender-based approach as a preliminary initiative for pedagogical innovation, or they implicitly and explicitly use them to disseminate discriminatory discourses. The study reveals that women’s positive representation is persistently deteriorated in the Moroccan EFL textbooks. This stands against all steps towards pedagogical innovation and reinforces the traditional gender ideology. It suggests the urgent need for more pedagogical improvement at the level of gender representation in the Moroccan EFL textbooks. More importantly, is the need for all teacher training centres to prepare new teacher generations ready to use sexist texts constructively. The results’ implication is instrumental to the learning materials’ revision. It is also useful for all English language practitioners, textbook designers, and pedagogical experts addressing the challenge of adopting a gender-based approach as a way to open all avenues for pedagogical innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,curriculum|deterioration|gender discriminatory discourses|Moroccan EFL textbooks|pedagogical innovation,2018-07-02T11:15:54.281532,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T02:05:21.918969,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/citation/,9n74b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mkrgv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/relationships/node/,mkrgv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e41351594d9002b1c6b705/,59e41351594d9002b1c6b705,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n74b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9n74b/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9n74b
