We hypothesize that probability weighting plays a role and that one ought to differentiate between periods in which agents overweight extreme events and those in which they underweight them. Overweighting inflates the probability of extremely bad events and demands greater compensation for beta risk.  Underweighting has the opposite effect.  Overall, these two effects offset each other, resulting in a flat or slightly negative return--beta relationship. Similarly, overweighting the tails enhances the negative relationship between return and coskewness, whereas underweighting reduces it.

On the Evolution of Income Composition Inequality in Italy 1989-2016,"We study the evolution of inequality in income composition in terms of capital and labor income in Italy between 1989 and 2016. We document a rise in the share of capital income accruing to the bottom of the distribution, whilst the top of the distribution increases its share of labor income. This implies a falling degree of income composition inequality in the period considered and, hence, the fact that Italy is moving away from being an economy composed of poor laborers and rich capitalists. This result is robust to the use of different definitions of capital and labor income. A falling degree of income composition inequality implies a weaker link between the functional and personal distributions of income. Therefore, fluctuations in the total factor shares of income are having an increasingly weaker impact on income inequality in Italy. Finally, we conceptualize a rule of thumb for policy makers seeking to reduce income inequality in the long run. This rule relates fluctuations in the total factor shares and the level of income composition inequality to the specific income source to be redistributed.

However, their implications in policy application usually remain superficial and fail to fully exploit state-of-the-art resources which digital era holds for text analysis. This paper illustrates the potential of deep-narrative analysis in energy policy research using text analysis tools from the cutting-edge domain of computational social sciences, notably topic modelling. We argue that a nested application of topic modelling and grounded theory in narrative analysis promises advances in areas where manual-coding driven narrative analysis has traditionally struggled with directionality biases, scaling, systematisation and repeatability. The nested application of the topic model and the grounded theory goes beyond the frequentist approach of narrative analysis and introduces insight generation capabilities based on the probability distribution of words and topics in a text corpus. In this manner, our proposed methodology deconstructs the corpus and enables the analyst to answer research questions based on the foundational element of the text data structure. We verify the theoretical and epistemological fit of the proposed nested methodology through a meta-analysis of a state-of-the-art bibliographic database on energy policy and computational social science. We find that the nested application contributes to the literature gap on the need for multidisciplinary polyvalence methodologies that can systematically include qualitative evidence into policymaking.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|energy policy|methodological framework|narratives|text analysis|topic modelling,2020-03-27T12:33:47.566574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-27T12:33:25.145988,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/citation/,hvcb5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7c67197190ce005893e112/,5e7c67197190ce005893e112,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hvcb5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hvcb5

There is currently no gold-standard definition or method for identifying suicide clusters, resulting in considerable heterogeneity in the types of suicide clusters that are detected.  This study sought to identify the characteristics, mechanisms, and parameters of suicide clusters using three cluster detection methods.  Specifically, the study aimed to: 1) determine the overlap in suicide clusters among each method; 2) compare the spatial and temporal parameters associated with different suicide clusters; and 3) identify the demographic characteristics and rates of exposure to suicide among cluster and non-cluster members.
Methods: 
Suicide data were obtained from the National Coronial Information System. N=3027 Australians, aged 10-24 who died by suicide in 2006-2015 were included. Suicide clusters were determined using: 1) poisson scan statistics; 2) a systematic search of coronial inquests; and 3) descriptive network analysis. These methods were chosen to operationalise three different definitions of suicide clusters, namely clusters that are: 1) statistically significant; 2) perceived to be significant; and 3) characterised by social links among three or more suicide descendents. For each method, the demographic characteristics and rates of exposure to suicide were identified, in addition to the maximum duration of suicide clusters, the geospatial overlap between suicide clusters, and the overlap of individual cluster members. 
Results: 
Eight suicide clusters (69 suicides) were identified from the scan statistic, seven (40 suicides) from coronial inquests; and 11 (37 suicides) from the descriptive network analysis. Of the eight clusters detected using the scan statistic, two overlapped with clusters detected using the descriptive network analysis and one with clusters identified from coronial inquests. Of the seven clusters from coronial inquests, four overlapped with clusters from the descriptive network analysis and one with clusters from the scan statistic. Overall, 9.2% (12 suicides) of individuals were identified by more than one method. Prior exposure to suicide was 10.1% (N=7) in clusters from the scan statistic; 32.5% (N=13) in clusters from coronial inquest; and 56.8% (N=21) in clusters from the descriptive network analysis.
Conclusion: 
Each method identified markedly different suicide clusters. Evidence of social links between cluster members was largely limited to clusters detected using the descriptive network analysis. However, these data were limited to the availability information collected as part of the police and coroner investigation.  Communities tasked with detecting and responding to suicide clusters may benefit from using the spatial and temporal parameters revealed in descriptive studies to inform analyses of suicide clusters using inferential methods.",TRUE,FALSE,Adolescents|Clusters|Public health|Suicide|Suicide contagion|Youth,2020-03-29T02:08:01.719505,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-29T02:07:42.379866,FALSE,NA,no,Due to confidentiality restrictions data is only avialable through direct application with the NCIS,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/citation/,a6q3p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7c55fdc3f8d3004afa0143/,5e7c55fdc3f8d3004afa0143,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6q3p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6q3p

Despite several advances, these “cognitive cultural” concepts are drawn on selectively, and limited work has attempted to assemble them into a coherent framework, leading to conceptual murkiness and ambiguous use of terms like “schema.” This article synthesizes literature on culture and cognition to develop a conceptual model of four interrelated but distinct types of cultural knowledge beneath the level of explicit discourse. Using emergence theories, the author theorizes how these types relate to each other, as well as to discourse and public culture. The utility of the model is then illustrated using the empirical case of American religious understandings.

One approach theorizes that people actively update their beliefs and behaviors in the face of new information. The other argues that, following early socialization experiences, dispositions are stable. We formalize these two models, elaborate empirical implications of each, and derive a simple combined model for comparing them using panel data. We test this model on 183 attitude and behavior items from the 2006-14 rotating panels of the General Social Survey. Though the pattern of results is complex, it is somewhat more consistent with the settled dispositions model than the active updating model. Most observed change in the GSS appears to be short-term attitude change or measurement error rather than persisting changes. When persistent change occurs, it is somewhat more likely to occur in younger people than older people and more common for public behaviors and beliefs about high-profile issues than private attitudes. We argue that we need both models in our theory of cultural evolution but that we need more research on the circumstances under which each is more likely to apply.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitude change|Cultural change|Panel data|Public opinion|Socialization,2020-03-25T14:53:44.365259,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-25T14:53:28.041209,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/citation/,8za35,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7b3cfed2927f00b8dcfb09/,5e7b3cfed2927f00b8dcfb09,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8za35/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8za35/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8za35

The underlying mechanisms remain understudied. The “cognitive perspective” of group identiﬁcation oﬀers a possible explanation, but is tacit on exact causal pathways. We predict that indiscriminate violence by armed actors induces fear of future attacks which in turn leads to prejudice, enhanced in-group cohesion, and calls for segregation. Selective violence that yields a lower probability of aﬀecting bystanders does not contribute to fear and thereby does not foster prejudice, segregation, and cohesion. To test our predictions, we rely on large-scale, reimbursed, electronic panel surveys conducted in Nairobi and Mombasa during the violent Kenyan elections in the Summer of 2017. Relying on the same 2,109 respondents, we conducted interviews before, during, and after violence erupted. We ﬁnd evidence for the predicted eﬀects among Christians while accounting for individual and survey wave ﬁxed eﬀects and in an additional endorsement experiment.",TRUE,FALSE,electoral violence|Kenya|panel survey|religious conﬂict,2020-03-25T14:58:21.457964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-25T14:58:11.773963,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/citation/,kngq2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7b0bbdd2927f009add4e5c/,5e7b0bbdd2927f009add4e5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngq2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kngq2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kngq2
