The earlier discussion on hunter-gatherer’s health, illness, and healthcare management knowledge system involves the discourse of epidemiological transitions. This research aims to understand the health knowledge system of present-day hunter-gatherers through cross-cultural comparison beyond the dichotomy of natural diseases and rational treatments. The researcher has focused on four contemporary hunter-gatherer’s communities  i.e. Arana-dan, Cholanaicken, Kattunayakan, Paniyan/Kattupaniyan of Nilambur valley, Kerala to understand the hunter-gatherer’s perception/conception of health and illness and what are mechanisms of healthcare and healing among them.  This research has highlighted the problem of static versus dynamic in the conception of health in the time spatiotemporal transition and the existing uniformity in the conception of health despite the diversity in socio-cultural practices. The research also delineates of hunter-gatherers relation to landscape (in the context of health and healthcare), and questions assumptions of ecofeminism and axioms of knowledge distribution system among the hunter-gatherers based on a Marxian division of labour.

Directional motives have two effects: (1) divergence -- voters with different preferences hold different beliefs, and (2) desensitization -- the relationship between incumbent performance and voter beliefs is weakened. While motivated reasoning does harm accountability, this is generally driven by desensitized voters rather than polarized partisans with politically motivated divergent beliefs. We also analyze the relationship between government performance and vote shares, showing that while motivated reasoning always weakens this relationship we cannot infer that accountability is also harmed.

Using online survey experiments, we examine whether exposure to populism increases out-group antipathy among white Democrats and Republicans. In Study 1, we randomly assign respondents to three conditions featuring vignettes based on political speeches: a morally neutral argument, a populist critique of political elites, and a morally framed anti-immigration appeal. We then assess respondents’ sentiments toward Latinos, an ethnic group commonly vilified in U.S. right-wing political discourse. The results demonstrate that exposure to populist rhetoric alone results in lower feeling-thermometer ratings of Latinos, but only among Republicans. Study 2 uses a similar design to evaluate the link between left-wing economic populism and economic nationalism: the populist condition features a critique of economic elites, the nationalist condition blames China for the offshoring of U.S. jobs, and the outcome variable measures respondents’ sentiments toward China. Economic nationalism generates increased chauvinism among conservative Democrats but economic populism does not. Together these findings suggest that the cross-domain spillover effects between nationalism and populism observed in Study 1 are driven by the discursive bundling of anti-elite talk with ethno-nationalism on the right, which stands in contrast to the decoupling of economic populism and economic nationalism on the left.

Not all opt-in samples are alike, however, and matching may improve data quality. Replicating and extending prior work, we compare the generalizability of relational inferences from unmatched and matched opt-in samples.

METHODS: Estimating identical models for four criminal justice outcomes, we compare multivariate regression results from national matched (YouGov) and unmatched (MTurk) opt-in samples to those from the General Social Survey (GSS). 

RESULTS: YouGov coefficients are almost always in the same direction as GSS coefficients, especially when statistically significant, and are mostly of a similar magnitude; less than 10% of the YouGov and GSS coefficients differ significantly. By contrast, MTurk coefficients are more likely to be in the wrong direction, more likely to be much larger or smaller, and are over twice as likely to differ significantly from GSS coefficients.

CONCLUSIONS: Matched opt-in samples provide a relatively inexpensive data source for criminal justice researchers, compared to probability samples, and also appear to carry a smaller generalizability penalty than unmatched samples.

Previous research has documented how age structures and co-residence patterns shape the vulnerability of populations to outbreaks of covid-19, with Spain being among the most vulnerable countries.
Objective
To document the role of age-specific co-residence patterns in shaping the vulnerability of Spanish provinces to mortality arising from within-household transmission of covid-19.
Method
We use data from the Spanish Population Registry 2018 on 10% of the population residing in private households in Spain. We combine information on the age and number of household members with infection fatality ratios related to covid-19 to estimate the average number of deaths per infection if a person becomes infected and transmits the virus to other household members. 
Results
Children live in the largest households of all age groups on average. However, the age profile of the persons that children live with reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of mortality arising due to within-household transmission of the virus.
Provinces with aged populations face a double challenge. Not only do they have large numbers of vulnerable persons due to their age, older persons are also more likely to share the same households in aged provinces.

This paper analyzes how the Great Recession affected the drop-out rate among university students in Italy, and whether their chosen field of study moderated its effect. To examine the potential long-term effects of this economic downturn on social inequality, we also explore whether students from less-advantaged families who enrolled in prestigious fields were those pushed out from university in disproportionally high numbers. We investigate the interacting influence of the economic crisis, social inequalities and field of study on drop-out rate using data from the Istat “Survey on the educational and occupational paths of high school graduates” in two cohorts of university students (one who attended university prior to and one during the Great Recession). Results obtained from propensity score matching show that the economic crisis had a negative effect on university participation, which was however less strong for Medicine students. Students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in the most remunerative fields of study (those leading to liberal professions), tended to leave university more often than their well-off peers.",TRUE,FALSE,Drop-out|Field of study|Great Recession|Higher education,2020-06-30T07:34:21.436064,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-30T07:34:11.839569,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/96042,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Loris Vergolini and Eleonora Vlach,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/citation/,d7me8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efa0021761b2c015f5c9e3c/,5efa0021761b2c015f5c9e3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d7me8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d7me8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d7me8

The strength of a welfare state shapes individual risk perceptions under normal circumstances. My research question is whether it also shapes risk perceptions in abnormal disaster scenarios, for example amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. I test this using the data from the global COVIDiSTRESS survey to compare 70 countries in April of 2020, a month where deaths resulting from Covid-19 affected three-quarters of the world’s societies. Controlling for local timing and severity of the pandemic, welfare state strength predicts lower risk perceptions. However, this it is not a universal effect as I expected. The welfare state impact depends on how quickly a government introduced strong ‘lock down’ measures. The longer it took a government to respond the more the welfare state reduces risk perceptions. Governments that took lock down measures in advance of the virus show no variation in risk perceptions, whereas governments that took 30 days to respond have up to a 1.5 standard deviation range of risk perceptions depending on the strength of the welfare state. I conclude that the welfare state matters very much when governments fail to take effective intervention measures in a global emergency.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|COVIDiSTRESS|Novel Coronavirus|Pandemic|Policy Intervention|Risk Perceptions|SARS-CoV-2|Welfare State,2020-06-30T07:32:20.914439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-30T07:32:07.685157,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/muhdz/,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/citation/,96fd2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/muhdz/,muhdz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef97b9b761b2c012a5cde9b/,5ef97b9b761b2c012a5cde9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96fd2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/96fd2/,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616696.2020.1793215,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/96fd2

This is only the second study investigating the effectiveness of defaults in tourism, and the first testing also the combined effect of default changes and pro-environmental appeals in the context of changing room cleaning defaults in hotels from automatic daily cleaning (with the choice of opting out) to no daily routine cleaning (with the choice of opt-in and requesting a free room clean every day). Results from a quasi-experimental study conducted in a three-star city hotel suggest that the change in defaults significantly reduced room cleaning, with only 32% of room cleans requested on average. Adding a pro-environmental appeal to the change in defaults did not further reduce room cleaning overall, but has an effect on certain segments of hotel guests.",TRUE,FALSE,choice architecture|defaults|hospitality|hotel room cleaning|pro-environmental behavior|sustainability|tourism,2020-06-29T04:21:02.177271,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-29T04:20:47.956142,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon request with data sharing agreement.,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leisure Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/citation/,vb9qa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3r95f/,3r95f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef929069fceff010c82dbe0/,5ef929069fceff010c82dbe0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb9qa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vb9qa/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0047287519879779,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vb9qa
