predicts that consensus will develop among a connected population as the
result of diffusion. In spite of the popularity of social diffusion models
that predict consensus, few empirical studies examine consensus, or a
clustering of attitudes, directly. Those that do either focus on the
coordinating role of strict hierarchies, or on the results of online
experiments, and do not consider how consensus occurs among groups in situ.
This study uses longitudinal data on adolescent social networks to show how
meso-level social structures, such as informal peer groups, moderate the
process of consensus formation. Using a novel method for controlling for
selection into a group, I find that centralized peer groups, meaning groups
with clear leaders, have very low levels of consensus, while cohesive peer
groups, meaning groups where more ties hold the members of the group
together, have very high levels of consensus. This finding is robust to two
different measures of cohesion and consensus. This suggests that consensus
occurs either through central leaders’ enforcement or through diffusion of
attitudes, but that central leaders have limited ability to enforce when
people can leave the group easily.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:09.144210,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-07T20:39:41.753000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/citation/,fzjh3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5nvws/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/relationships/node/,5nvws,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57f8080e9ad5a100499a2c21/,57f8080e9ad5a100499a2c21,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fzjh3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fzjh3/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496517704859,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fzjh3

*We use data from the 2002-2013 National Surveys of Family Growth to
examine change across U.S. cohorts born between 1966 and 1995 in whether
individuals have had sex with same-sex partners only, or with both men and
women, and in whether they have a bisexual or gay identity. Adjusted for
age, race/ethnicity, immigrant status, and mother’s education, we find
increases across cohorts in the proportion of women who report a bisexual
identity, who report ever having had sex with both sexes, or who report
having had sex with women only. By contrast, we find no cohort trend for
men; roughly 5% of men in every cohort have ever had sex with a man, and
the proportion claiming a gay or bisexual attraction changed little. In
concluding, we speculate that the gender difference is rooted in a broader
pattern of asymmetry in gender change in which departures from traditional
gender norms are more acceptable for women than men.*",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:09.852653,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-07T17:39:52.781000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/citation/,2y2xp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d96na/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/relationships/node/,d96na,nodes,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57f7ddea9ad5a101e2a27443/,57f7ddea9ad5a101e2a27443,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2y2xp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2y2xp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2y2xp

Because of the inherent uncertainty about the risks involved, debates  on the topic abound. Scientists agree that more research is needed on both the potential impacts of geoengineering on humans and ecosystems, and the governance mechanisms that would be the most appropriate for conducting field research and for eventual deployment. Despite an explosion of publications in the last decade or so, properly sociological analysis is still lacking. In this paper, I develop an approach to geoengineering based on metabolic rift theory to consider the broad political economic context in which geoengineering technologies are being developed. I argue first that the eventual recourse to such last resort approaches is a consequence of the ever expanding carbon rift created by capitalism and the growth imperative it entails. Second, we discuss how geoengineering technologies would likely be deployed within the context of the neoliberal climate policy regime that is currently in place and that relies heavily on carbon markets. I outline some of the foreseeable consequences of tying geoengineering to carbon markets on greenhouse gas emissions reduction and on the possibility of exerting democratic control over the technologies themselves.",TRUE,FALSE,Capitalism|Carbon markets|Climate capitalism|Climate change|Commodities|Geoengineering|Negative emissions technologies|Political economy|socarxiv|Solar radiation management,2018-07-02T10:51:50.557838,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-04T19:08:40.675000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/citation/,qm8wj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bj2sb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/relationships/node/,bj2sb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57f3fe3a6c613b01f113e740/,57f3fe3a6c613b01f113e740,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qm8wj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qm8wj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qm8wj

Exploring the links between regulation, markets, and technology at the Securities and Exchange Commission, 1935-2010","Why did financial regulators neglect oversight of rapid technological change in markets, despite the increasingly transformative power of technology? In this paper, I turn to this puzzling omission as an opportunity to consider the conjoined histories of technology, governance, and regulatory imaginaries in finance. For this, I leverage the concept of market ontologies (Lie 1997) as a way of addressing the semantic and cultural constellations that shape attitudes about, and the governance of, the economic world. To understand the relative neglect of technology as an object of regulation, I study the content, constraints, and possibilities implied by the market ontologies of American financial regulators between c. 1930 and 2012. In identifying these loose and nebulous constellations of understanding, I link my exploration of ontologies to their uses in computer science, where they are operationalized as representations of discourse within particular domains that outline meaning as formed by how concepts are classified into larger, interrelated sets (Poli et al 2010). This computational characterization inspires my methods and allows tracing the ontological evolution of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s understanding of technology in relation to markets over much of the twentieth century. To regulate markets, agents must first conceptualize these entities to render them concrete objects for governance. Studying regulators’ market ontologies is thus an opportunity to understand what type of objects they think need governing and which might be glossed over.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:11.308026,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-10-04T18:52:32.971000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/citation/,m7rjz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hmvtq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/relationships/node/,hmvtq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57f3fa739ad5a101fc77fd0c/,57f3fa739ad5a101fc77fd0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7rjz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m7rjz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m7rjz

I discuss sociological roadblocks to economic thinking, namely disagreements about preference formation, social influence, and the importance of group-level phenomena. I show that these ideas can be integrated into an individual choice modeling approach based on the assumption that individuals maximize the ""morality"" or ""rightness"" of a choice in a particular context, rather than its rational utility. I suggest that scholars place explicit constraints on the analysis itself, rather than on the cognition of the actors being analyzed, which allows for truly scientific, endogenous models of individual choice that maintain analytical rigor.

Proponents claim it will fuel a research revolution, but skeptics challenge it as unreliably measured and decontextualized, with limited utility for accurately answering social science research questions. We argue that social scientists need effective tools to quantify big data’s measurement error and expand the contextual information associated with it. Standard research efforts in many fields already pursue these goals through data augmentation, the systematic assessment of measurement against known quantities and expansion of extant data by adding new information. Traditionally, these tasks are accomplished using trained research assistants or specialized algorithms. However, such approaches may not be scalable to big data or appease its skeptics. We consider a third alternative that may increase the validity and value of big data: data augmentation with online crowdsourcing. We present three empirical cases to illustrate the strengths and limits of crowdsourcing for academic research, with a particular eye to how they can be applied to data augmentation tasks that will accelerate acceptance of big data among social scientists. The cases use Amazon Mechanical Turk to (1) verify automated coding of the academic discipline of dissertation committee members, (2) link online product pages to a book database, and (3) gather data on mental health resources at colleges. In light of these cases, we consider the costs and benefits of augmenting big data with crowdsourcing marketplaces and provide guidelines on best practices. We also offer a standardized reporting template that will enhance reproducibility.
