This qualitative study was done in two stages namely subjects selection and investigation on the subjects’ professional development for their pedagogical competence in teaching implementation. The criteria of subjects selection have reflected the four competences that professional teachers need to possess which include personal, social, pedagogical and professional competences. The data collection was done by using questionnaire, interview guide, observation sheet. This study involves four  selected professional English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers from Malang city, Malang Regency, and Batu town. The results show that PD activities done by the subjects include having discussion with colleagues, joining teacher association forum, attending seminars and workshops, taking courses, doing research, reading relevant sources, surfing the net,and doing team teaching. The ways how the subjects learn cover doing reflection, taking and giving feedback, discussing, broadening knowledge, researching, and problem solving.

The participants included 100 students (55 male, 45 female). All participants were pursuing their third years of study in an English department.  Two instruments were employed: questionnaires regarding Motivation for Foreign Language Learning (MFLL) and Vocabulary Size Test (VST). The primary goal of this study is to determine which factors of motivation profoundly affect the foreign language learning processes of Iraqi EFL students and to what extent they should develop their depth and breadth English vocabularies in order to sufficiently acquire the language and elaborate the importance of both components in language acquisition. Findings showed that female students experienced both types of motivation, with the mean score of extrinsic motivation being 29.91, and that for intrinsic motivation being 31.20, while the mean score of male students was 27.10 for extrinsic motivation and 28.00 for intrinsic motivation. The VST ranged from 1,000 to 14,000 word-families, and the vocabulary size of both groups was over 6,000 word-families. Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between learner motivation and vocabulary size. For both groups, the results indicated no relationship between these two aspects of students' foreign language leaning.

Different approaches and methods have emerged throughout the history of language learning/teaching based on the influence of different theories of language, psychology, and related domains such as psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, pragmatics and cultural studies. Two major trends in language teaching emerged under the influence of these mentioned language theories, namely, accuracy based versus fluency based approaches. This article gives a historical sketch up to these trends in an attempt to provide a historical background and to empirically bring evidence that wait time instruction and teaching experience can impact classroom feedback in Moroccan classes. Relevant questions related to the role of teachers’ experience in leading different types of feedback, the effect of the number of teaching years as well as the correlation between wait time instruction and the corresponding teaching experience are closely investigated. This article adheres to a mixed design or what has been identified in research methodology as ex-post facto (Cohen, Manion, Morrison, 2007). Therefore, it is both a qualitative and a descriptive one. For the type of instructions used, the results obtained show the insignificance of the impact of experience on this variable. On the other hand, results retained that wait- time instruction in comparison to other items recorded a higher significance of the impact of experience.

This research was qualitative case study conducted in English Language 1 class Economics Education Study Program of Teacher Training and Education Institute Persatuan Guru Republik Indonesia Bojonegoro, East java. The participants were an English teacher and thirty four students. Observations were conducted twice in November 2016. The data were analysed by using the combination of interaction analysis system adapted from (Flanders, 1970; Moskowitz, 1971; Brown, 1975; Al-Otaibi, 2004; and Erling et al., 2012). The findings show that the teacher produced almost all types of teacher talk. They also produced almost all types of student talk in learning process. The teaching-learning activities used produced the patterns of group work, choral responses, closed-ended teacher questioning (IRF), individual work, student initiates-teacher answers, open-ended teacher questioning, and collaboration.

Words that share a similarity of meaning are called to be synonymous, and words that share a contrary of meaning are called to be antonymous. Both of them are universal linguistic phenomenon that exist in terms of linguistic system of every language. The present study aims at finding out areas of difficulty that Iraqi EFL learners encounter in the use of synonymy and antonymy, both on the recognition and production levels. Also tries to detect the main reasons behind such difficulties. A diagnostic test of two parts, namely, recognition and production, is designed. The test is built to include two linguistic phenomenon which are: synonymy and antonymy. A random sample of one (100) third year College students of two Colleges of Education, in University of Baghdad and University of Diyala, (50) students each. Data analyzed were based on Cruse's taxonomy (1986). The study has come up with the following conclusions: in spite of being students at an advanced level in learning English, they used a general lexical item, instead of their other synonyms and antonyms which imply a narrower sense of meaning. And although Iraqi EFL learners learn a number of synonym words and antonym words during their academic years of studying English, still they cannot utilize them correctly in context.",TRUE,FALSE,antonyms|production|recognition|synonyms,2018-07-02T11:03:34.281604,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T03:38:39.999907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/citation/,nqt7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nczfb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/relationships/node/,nczfb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972c8326c613b0228372573/,5972c8326c613b0228372573,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqt7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nqt7g/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nqt7g

This study employed a quantitative approach, whereby a total of 132 high school students were randomly selected from the Karkh’sdistrict of Baghdad to constitute the sample of the study. A 30-item 3-point Likert scale questionnaire on writing strategy use that was adapted from Petrić&amp;Czárl’s (2003) writing strategy questionnaire served as the instrument of the study. The results of the study reveal that the frequency of strategy use was low among the participants. In addition, no significant difference was found between high and low proficiency students’strategy use. Finally, it was found that there is significant difference between female and male students’ strategy use. Female students were found to use writing strategies more than males. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|Iraqi EFL learners|language proficiency|writing strategy,2018-07-02T11:03:34.236181,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T03:35:04.344784,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/citation/,wext4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s9rd5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/relationships/node/,s9rd5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972c6d4594d90022980fccb/,5972c6d4594d90022980fccb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wext4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wext4/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wext4
