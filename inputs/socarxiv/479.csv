We explore how trends differ by gender, race and class background. We use data from the 1988-2016 General Social Surveys. We find steady increases across birth cohorts in the proportion of men and women who have had both male and female sexual partners since age 18. A key finding is a race-gender intersection: black men and women of all races had similar increases— increases which were much steeper than those observed for white men. We suggest that women’s increase is rooted in a long-term asymmetry in gender change, in which nonconformity to gender norms in many arenas is more acceptable for women than men. As the increase for men is largest among black men—and this is the population most affected by the rise of mass incarceration—we suggest the latter may be a contributing factor.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-24T18:06:42.052356,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-24T18:06:17.420595,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,Emma Mishel,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/citation/,af8qk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w2b5t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/relationships/node/,w2b5t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3fae774e95590013ac6963/,5b3fae774e95590013ac6963,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/af8qk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/af8qk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/af8qk,NA

Most colleges require criminal history information on their applications, suggesting that an applicant’s criminal history could be a significant impediment to accessing the benefits of higher education. We conducted a modified experimental audit to learn whether criminal records affect admissions decisions. Matched same-race pairs of tester applications were sent to a national sample of non-elite four-year colleges, with both testers applying as either Black or White. Within each pair, one application signaled a prior low-level felony conviction when required by the application. Consistent with research on employment, the rejection rate for applicants with felonies was 2½ times the rate of our control testers. But unlike the large racial differences observed in employment, we find smaller racial differences in admissions decisions. Nevertheless, Black applicants with criminal records who disclosed their records were particularly penalized at colleges with high campus crime rates. We address implications for reentry, racial progress, and the college “Ban the Box” movement.

The following are the examples of theoretical and practical questions that are driving our research:

What does it mean to represent ""culture"" by ""data""? What are the unique possibilities offered by computational analysis of large cultural data in contrast to qualitative methods used in humanities and social science? How can we use quantitative techniques to study the key cultural form of our era — interactive media? How can we combine computational analysis and visualization of large cultural data with qualitative methods, including ""close reading""? (In other words, how does one combine analysis of larger patterns with the analysis of individual artifacts and their details?)  How can computational analysis do justice to variability and diversity of cultural artifacts and processes, rather than focusing on the ""typical"" and ""most popular""?

Eight years later, the work of our lab has become only a tiny portion of a very large body of research. Thousands of researchers have already published tens of thousands of papers analyzing patterns in massive cultural datasets. First, there are data describing the activity on the most popular social networks (Flickr, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, etc.), user-created content shared on these networks (tweets, images, video, etc.), and also users' interactions with this content (likes, favorites, reports, comments). Second, researchers have also started to analyze particular professional cultural areas and historical periods, such as website design, fashion photography, twentieth-century popular music, nineteenth-century literature, etc. This work is carried out in two newly developed fields — social computing and digital humanities.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-23T20:56:01.205595,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-23T20:55:39.065387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/citation/,b2y79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/94wqp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/relationships/node/,94wqp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7de5698c6d9f001bae1638/,5b7de5698c6d9f001bae1638,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2y79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b2y79/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b2y79,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.004

We argue that performance indicators should be used for learning and innovation rather than for indicator-based accountability. Accountability can only enhance innovation when it allows for staff and stakeholders to critically think about the results. They have to engage in a performance dialogue on the meaning of indicators that also accounts for complexity. Indicator-based accountability, however, typically does not allow for such thinking. In our view, reforming accountability therefore implies that results- based accountability needs to be saved from its indicators.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|innovation|learning|performance indicators,2018-08-23T21:04:42.936173,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-23T21:04:20.355256,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/citation/,z4vk2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7d26af99a6cb001c4bc9d4/,5b7d26af99a6cb001c4bc9d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4vk2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z4vk2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z4vk2,NA

The current study takes this research in a different direction by examining (1) whether pornography use may be associated with entrance into marriage during early adulthood and (2) whether this association is moderated by both gender and religion, two key factors strongly related to both pornography use and earlier marriage. Longitudinal data were taken from waves 1, 3, and 4 of the National Study of Youth and Religion, a nationally-representative panel study of Americans from their teenage years into early adulthood (N = 1,691). It was theorized that frequent pornography use at earlier survey waves may foster more sexually progressive attitudes that may lead to devaluing marriage as an institution, and, for religious men in particular, may disincentivize marriage as a “socially legitimate” means of sexual fulfillment. Findings affirmed that, compared to more moderate levels of pornography use, higher levels of pornography use in emerging adulthood were associated with a lower likelihood of marriage by the final survey wave for men, but not women. This association was not moderated by religiosity for either gender. Moreover, among men, higher frequency pornography viewers were not significantly different from non-viewers in their likelihood of marriage entry. Data limitations and implications for future research are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,early adult|emerging adult|family|marriage|pornography|young adult,2018-08-22T13:01:23.088765,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-22T13:01:09.139464,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/citation/,xry3z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/csydh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/relationships/node/,csydh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7c89af99a6cb001a4b6abf/,5b7c89af99a6cb001a4b6abf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xry3z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xry3z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xry3z,NA
