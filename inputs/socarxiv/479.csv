Statistical Probability and the Rise of the Novel,"Literary scholars in the information age, whatever issues we may differ on, have long shared a belief that the amount of ""information"" in literary language is not a phenomenon that can be empirically investigated. We tell our students, and remind each other, that the meaning in literary texts is inherently subjective, culture-specific, and contextual rather than fixed. Scholar Katherine Bode reaffirms this article of faith in a new book on digital literary methodology, writing that ""literary data are inevitably constructed and transactional, whether they are explicitly designated so or not."" Long prose forms such as the novel seem especially immune to empirical assessment. As Thomas Pavel notes, the wide-open form of the novel allows ""for any imaginable kind of confabulation without constraint,"" while the fact that each reader can reinterpret and recontextualize a novel anew seems to guarantee that the meanings latent in such texts can never be fully described, much less quantified. Probably because both digital and traditional humanists hold these beliefs, most data mining, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and other distant reading methods used on fiction search for subtle patterns or relative thematic trends across time, or for faint signals of style detectable in genres or the works of individual writers.

Yeats,"Much has been said about myth, especially in relation to poetry. Contemporary studies have also revealed modern poetry’s immense interest in myth. However, only dispersed references to the potential impact the use of myth in poetry may have on nationalism have been made. Moreover, the complex interweaving of poetry and myth has been probed only in general terms, disregarding sundry aspects. Thus, this article investigates some issues pertaining to myth and poetry. Specifically, it interrogates the relationship between poetry and myth, both of which are cogently interwoven to the extent that we can hardly disassociate them. This interrogation attempts to question the role of the ubiquitous presence of myth in the poetry of William Butler Yeats. To meet this objective, this article explores the Cuchulain myth in his poems.

With a so ancient a practice as intertextuality; influence, allusion and quotation seem to smolder the old assumptions about originality and creativity. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the utilization of intertextuality in the novel entitled The Lonely Londoners (1956) by the Trinidadian postcolonial writer Sam Selvon (1923-1994). To do so, a survey on the provenance of intertextuality is displayed, with reference to its pioneers who claimed that the text is a heterogeneous combination of texts, namely Kristeva and Bakhtin. Additionally, the article introduces several models of the concept that are relevant to the analysis of the aforementioned novel along with a brief overview on the cultural and social parameters leading to its creation. This inquiry shows that The Lonely Londoners textually intertwines with a few works of the literary canon, biblical characters and eminent legal cases via some names of its characters, in addition to other direct quotations. As this paper submits, the audience should reach a rational stance on the use of intertextuality in the postcolonial novel to relate to universally shared images about racial prejudice and alienation.",TRUE,FALSE,alienation|allusion|intertextuality|literary canon|quotation|racial prejudice|Sam Selvon|The Lonely Londoners,2019-07-25T19:31:22.084559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:31:02.807536,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/citation/,3qwbe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f627782a3950017cc1e1f/,5c6f627782a3950017cc1e1f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3qwbe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3qwbe,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.17

Remaining true to one’s identity and being faithful to the core values of one’s culture is a complicated matter when it comes to a black living in white society like America, where color and racial identity are rudimentary prerequisites in self-definition and naming. Philip Roth’s novel entitled The Human   Stain (2000) shows how some black figures undress their black identity to wear the prestigious       white one to go onward with life as full selves, to have access to all the privileges the whites enjoy,  and, above all, to live without the specter of race and the decisiveness of epidermal signs. The novel calls into question and revision such essentialist notions as other, class,andrace by describing the crises the subject or self undergoes in the light of racial prejudices, center-periphery relations, and class stereotypes. The present paper, then, addresses the act of self-abdication the protagonist, Silk Coleman, carries out to overstep the feeling of otherness and to dodge racial discrimination. The paper looks into the notions of selfhood and Otherness by negotiating the definition of the self and the distortion it undergoes in its encounter with the Other . The study aims at revealing, primarily, the effects of Black racial-passing, a common phenomenon in American society of the first half of the twentieth century, on familial relationships and cultural heritage.

The significant of the study is based on the fact that it contributes to the understanding of how linguistic and stylistic analysis of a text can be used, extensively, to clarify features and meanings in texts. Nine poems were selected to represent Wordsworth poetry. The poems were selected randomly. Cohesive devices were identified in the poems and analyzed using the content analysis technique. They were analyzed quantitatively. The analysis revealed a number of interesting results, namely: All types of cohesive devices were used in the poems selected for the purpose of the study (reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and lexical cohesion). There were some variations in the use of some devices; in that certain devices were used at a very high rate of frequency compared to others. The main function of the use of cohesive devices within the poems was to help the poet express romantic values. Based on the results obtained, the study suggests the following: First, it would be interesting, for further studies to conduct more studies on the coherence of English literary discourse.

The approach adopted while investigating such postulation is a critical discourse analysis perspective steeped in Van Dijk’s (2004) model of probing ideologies to six of al-Mu’allaqa’s most culturally challenging lines of verse.

Victorian literature is usually read against the relationship between art and reality. The literary merit of a book is determined by the degree of its conformity with the moral values of the time. This paper offers a detached reading of the novel where the value of the book is found in its ability to initiate the reader into an aesthetic world. The research argues that Wilde fragments the act of artistic creation among the artist (the painter Basil), the sitter (Dorian Gray) and the audience (Lord Henry Wotton).

However, at the very beginning novelists seem to support the victimization of Americans and accuse the Muslims but later, many voices, including Muslim as well as non-Muslim writers, contribute through giving a voice to the ‘enemy’, and the American novelist Jess Walter is no exception. This analytical study, then, aims at providing evidence that Walter portrays Muslim characters in his work The Zero (2006) and that he does so to deconstruct the idea that Americans are totally innocent and victims while Muslims are the only entity to blame. The present paper, thus, is an attempt to pinpoint that through depicting several characters, including American and Middle Eastern ones, as reacting to the dominating ‘truth’, Walter seems to be giving a voice to the voiceless and providing readers with a different version of reality. Therefore, the ultimate purpose of this study is to prove that The Zero can be considered as a counter-discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,9/11 fiction|discourse|Jess Walter|Muslim characters|reality,2019-07-25T19:15:41.269534,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:15:15.467859,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/citation/,75s3a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f47488d5d98001a34379e/,5c6f47488d5d98001a34379e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s3a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75s3a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75s3a,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.8

The identity of the American subject should be investigated in the light of his/her restless search of “Other modes of freedom” and imaginary homelands.  -Pondering upon this, the researcher realizes that three fundamental questions need to be addressed: What are the aspects of Henderson's spiritual quest?  -As a Jewish hero, how could Henderson be associated with quest, victimization and madness?  Can one think about identity or identities?  To unmask these blind spots, the theme of the quest will be investigated, first.  The researcher shall trace Henderson's movement from a material world – New York – to a spiritual and romantic one, Africa.  Second, Henderson's failure to cope with the new world and therefore his failure to (re) – construct the identity of the American character will be examined in details.  This safely allows us to argue for the madness of the hero.  The conclusion is that there is no ‘absolute identity’ to the American subject.  Henderson's attempts to re-construct a “new identity” shall be seen in line with poststructuralist premises regarding “difference, multiplicity, other, cultural diversity.”",TRUE,FALSE,Alienation|Hegel|Henderson the Rain King|identity|Saul Bellow,2019-07-25T19:14:02.645246,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:13:34.233285,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/citation/,9vedb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f45a062c82a0018d80991/,5c6f45a062c82a0018d80991,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vedb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9vedb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9vedb,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.7
