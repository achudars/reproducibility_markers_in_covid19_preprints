After setting out in brief the emergence of smart cities and current key debates, we note a number of practical, political and normative questions relating to citizenship, justice, and the public good that warrant examination. The remainder of the paper provides an initial framing for engaging with these questions. The first section details the dominant neoliberal conception and enactment of smart cities and how this works to promote the interests of capital and state power and reshape governmentality. We then detail some of the ethical issues associated with smart city technologies and initiatives. Having set out some of the more troubling aspects of how social relations are produced within smart cities, we then examine how citizens and citizenship have been conceived and operationalised in the smart city to date. We then follow this with a discussion of social justice and the smart city. In the final section, we explore the notion of the ‘right to the smart city’ and how this might be used to recast the smart city in emancipatory and empowering ways.",TRUE,FALSE,citizenship|ethics|right to the city|smart cities|social justice,2018-10-19T13:07:01.440865,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T13:06:40.806098,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/citation/,b8aq5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/76d3s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/relationships/node/,76d3s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc854a9f97c53001614ba34/,5bc854a9f97c53001614ba34,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8aq5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8aq5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8aq5

This hostility is typically attributed to social group identity, motivated reasoning, or a combination thereof.  In this paper, I empirically examine a novel explanation: the ``unmotivated'' cognitive bias of overprecision (overconfidence in precision of beliefs).  Overprecision could cause partisan hostility indirectly via inflated confidence in one's own ideology, partisan identity, or perceptions of social distance between the parties.  Overprecision could also cause this hostility directly by causing excessively strong inferences from observed information that is either skewed against the out-party or simply misunderstood.  Using a nationally representative sample, I find consistent support for direct effects of overprecision and mixed support for indirect effects.  The point estimates imply a one standard deviation increase in a respondent's overprecision predicts as much as a 0.71 standard deviation decline in relative out-party favorability.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-19T13:24:21.784079,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T13:24:09.120886,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/citation/,hr5ba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mwjys/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/relationships/node/,mwjys,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc74f1953cec40018af0356/,5bc74f1953cec40018af0356,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr5ba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hr5ba/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hr5ba

Bias and Bayesian affective polarization,"I present a model of affective polarization---growth in hostility over time between two parties---via quasi-Bayesian inference.  In the model, two agents repeatedly choose actions.  Each choice is based on a balance of concerns for private interests and the social good.  More weight is put on private interests when an agent's character is intrinsically more self-serving and when the other agent is believed to be more self-serving.  Each agent Bayesian updates about the other's character, and dislikes the other more when she is perceived as more self-serving.  I characterize the effects on growth in dislike of three biases: a prior bias against the other agent's character, the false consensus bias, and limited strategic thinking.  Prior bias against the other's character remains constant or declines over time, and actions do not diverge.  The other two biases cause actions to become more extreme over time and repeatedly be ``worse'' than expected, causing mutual growth in dislike, i.e., affective polarization.  The magnitude of dislike can become arbitrarily large---even when both players are arbitrarily ``good'' (unselfish).  The results imply that seemingly irrelevant cognitive biases can be an important cause of the devolution of relationships, in politics and beyond, and that subtlety and unawareness of bias can be key factors driving the degree of polarization.",TRUE,FALSE,affective polarization,2018-10-19T13:22:05.081917,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-19T13:21:51.058026,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/citation/,58sru,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uxjae/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/relationships/node/,uxjae,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc74c418811c10019567033/,5bc74c418811c10019567033,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58sru/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58sru/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58sru

This reconfiguration used cultural and religious fundamentalism in the form of Hindutva as its instrument to assert their right to access the resources and strive towards a non-State centric redistribution. However, this new middle class, which was mainly conversing in the vernacular and had its base in the smaller urban areas, was also faced with the assertion of the lower class identarian groups. In such a situation, a large section of the urban Indian middle class shied away from taking part in the electoral process citing moral crises of the corrupt secular English speaking elite on one hand and the lowly criminal nature of the lower class political assertion on the other. Taking hints from the works of Christophe Jaffrelot, I would try to argue in this paper, that non-participation of a major section of the urban middle class was a manifestation of securing the rechanneled and partially redistributed rent legitimised through the instrument of Hindutva. This has led to increased persona-centric populist narratives from the mid-1990s to the present times with efforts to undermine parliamentary democracy (which is associated as an institiution of the immoral secular nationalists).

Descriptive and Injunctive Norms in a Wikipedia Sub-Community,"Open online communities rely on social norms for behavior regulation, group cohesion, and sustainability. Research on the role of social norms online has mainly focused on one source of influence at a time, making it difficult to separate different normative influences and understand their interactions. In this study, we use the Focus Theory to examine interactions between several sources of normative influence in a Wikipedia sub-community: local descriptive norms, local injunctive norms, and norms imported from similar sub- communities. We find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. We contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration.",TRUE,FALSE,intra-group processes|online communities|open collaboration|socialization|social norms|virtual teams|Wikipedia,2018-10-17T00:28:04.005892,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-17T00:27:44.390648,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science,Jonathan T.
