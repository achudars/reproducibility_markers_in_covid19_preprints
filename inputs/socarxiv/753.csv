Exacerbating these concerns, an influential Monte Carlo study by Stegmueller (2013) suggests that frequentist methods yield biased estimates and severely anti-conservative inference with small upper-level samples. Stegmueller recommends Bayesian techniques, which he claims to be superior in terms of both bias and inferential accuracy. In this paper, we reassess and refute these results. First, we formally prove that frequentist maximum likelihood estimators of coefficients are unbiased. The apparent bias found by Stegmueller is simply a manifestation of Monte Carlo Error. Second, we show how inferential problems can be overcome by using restricted maximum likelihood estimators for variance parameters and a t-distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom for statistical inference. Thus, accurate multilevel analysis is possible without turning to Bayesian methods, even if the number of upper-level units is small.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian inference|Bias|Maximum Likelihood|Mixed Effects Models|Multilevel analysis|SocArxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:05.325128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-10T09:48:46.604000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,by the authors,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/citation/,z65s4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fkn3u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/relationships/node/,fkn3u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584bcd15b83f6901f6ad298c/,584bcd15b83f6901f6ad298c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z65s4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z65s4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z65s4

Differences in skills distributions and the labor market disadvantage of less-educated adults across 21 countries,"Less-educated adults bear the highest risk of labor market marginalization in all advanced economies, but the extent of their disadvantage differs considerably across countries. Exploiting unique data on the actual skills of adults from PIAAC 2011/12, we examine two prominent explanations for this cross-country variation. Human capital theory suggests that the marginalization of less-educated individuals reflects a lack of skills. The signaling explanation emphasizes the role of educational credentials as easy-to-observe proxies for skills and productivity. It suggests that the skills distribution of educational groups can affect their labor market position beyond any individual-level effect of skills by influencing the signaling value or “skills transparency” of educational credentials. Applying a two-step regression approach to a sample of 48,033 adults in 21 countries, we find support for both explanations. Consistent with human capital theory, literacy and numeracy skills are positively related to occupational status at the individual level and partly account for cross-national differences in the labor market disadvantage of less-educated adults. Yet, cross-country variation remains considerable even after controlling for skills and further key observables. Consistent with the signaling account, country-level regressions show that the remaining variation is related to two direct measures of skills transparency: the aggregate skills differential between less- and intermediate-educated adults and the internal homogeneity of these groups. We also find that the labor market disadvantage of less-educated adults increases with the vocational orientation of secondary education, presumably reflecting individual- and aggregate-level effects of occupation-specific skills, which were not assessed in PIAAC.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Inequality|International comparison|Labor market|PIAAC|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:47.324662,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-09T11:56:25.875000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",by the authors,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/citation/,wc4s9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8jb4r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/relationships/node/,8jb4r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584a9878b83f6901f6ad26ea/,584a9878b83f6901f6ad26ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wc4s9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wc4s9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wc4s9

This paper examines an emerging effort in South Africa to counter this fragmentation: the United Front project, initiated and led by the National Union of Metalworkers South Africa (NUMSA). Drawing on 74 interviews conducted at two different NUMSA-led protests in Johannesburg, the analysis unpacks two sets of tensions. One set of tensions revolves around class politics, which pertain to the divide between unionized workers in relatively stable employment, and impoverished communities ravaged by unemployment. The other set of tensions revolves around party politics, including divisions with respect to the United Front's opposition to the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC).

Answering this question is key to understanding the impact on transnational legal mobilization of Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Shell, in which the US Supreme Court sharply limited the scope of the ATS. Yet socio-legal scholars know remarkably little about the experiences of ATS litigants, before or after Kiobel. This article describes how activist litigants in a landmark ATS class action against former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos faced a series of strategic dilemmas, and how disagreements over how to resolve those dilemmas played into divisions between activists and organizations on the Philippine left.

Stylized facts are both positive claims (about what is in the world) and normative claims (about what merits scholarly attention). Much of canonical social science research can be usefully characterized as the production or contestation of stylized facts. Beyond their value as grist for the theoretical mill of social scientists, stylized facts also travel directly into the political arena.

The author uses the perceptions of a sample of successful Taiwanese immigrant parents regarding marriageable partners for their children to examine how integration can result in resistance to intermarriage with whites. An analytical framework called marital boundaries is proposed to show how differences between ‘marriageable us’ and ‘undesirable them’ are perceived by individuals who occupy different family positions. Data from 37 interviews with highly achieving Taiwan-origin immigrants residing in San Diego reveal a long-term effect of homeland politics on their Asian-centered hierarchies for preferred marriage partners for their children. Impacted by a growing sense of Taiwanese nationalism starting in the 1970s, many interviewees described a moral line between different Asian groups that helped them define their marital boundaries. The data provide evidence of a tendency among Asian immigrants to follow segmented assimilation paths based in part on transnational influences. The findings challenge assumptions found in the immigration literature that define intermarriage with whites as a form of social mobility, as well as descriptions of Asians as a single homogeneous category.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:48:29.522339,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-12-08T08:19:27.211000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/citation/,cpxh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wdvnt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/relationships/node/,wdvnt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/584917509ad5a102066b4631/,584917509ad5a102066b4631,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpxh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cpxh8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cpxh8
