Second- and third-generation Chinese-Argentines are quickly abandoning their home language variety (e.g. Taiwanese or Fujianese) for Spanish. At the same time, their parents are sending them to weekend language schools to acquire Standard Mandarin, a variety distinct from the language of the home.
     Through an ethnographic study of a weekend language school in Buenos Aires Chinatown, I seek to explore the phenomenon of language loss in the Chinese-Argentine community. In order to provide sufficient background to explain the linguistic and sociological phenomena observed, this paper will begin by providing a description of the Chinese community in Argentina, outlining theories of language loss in minority communities, and reviewing historical language shifts in China and Argentina. After laying out this framework, I will then describe the ethnographic project and analyze the observations I gathered in the field. 
     I find that the Chinese community in Argentina is generally following the Fishman (1965) model of language shift, in which the Argentine-born second-generation is dominant in Spanish and chooses to raise children in that language, meaning that subsequent generations are monolingual in Spanish. However, weekend language schools complicate this shift by teaching Standard Mandarin to the youth of the community. Because second- and third-generation children are still acquiring Standard Mandarin in these schools, Chinese language and culture are being maintained at some level; however, it is still unclear how stable this maintenance is. What is clear is that because there is little to no reinforcement outside of the home, non-standard varieties of Chinese will not survive past the second generation. I hope that this paper will spur further research on the Chinese-Argentine community, on which there is very little social science literature.",TRUE,FALSE,Argentina|China|heritage language education|immigration|Taiwan,2018-07-02T11:12:50.509039,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-22T16:49:16.499418,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/citation/,ywrcn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8pr92/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/relationships/node/,8pr92,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c53d88594d900250e96843/,59c53d88594d900250e96843,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ywrcn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ywrcn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ywrcn,NA

The main findings come from research in the U.S. revealing that the 90th/10th income achievement gap has widened by about 50% in the last 30 years. This chapter aims to investigate whether there are discernible patterns in the evolution of the achievement gap from a comparative perspective. Using over 15 years of data and 32 countries from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), I find that there is considerable variation in the way in which the gap is evolving, with the U.S. and Germany closing at about 50% and 30% in the last 15 years while France is widening at a similar rate. I find that curricular tracking and vocational enrollment explain 40% of the variance in the achievement gap between countries and show that the relationship is conditioned by a strong interaction. Low curricular tracking is associated with a small achievement gap, whereas high levels of curricular tracking is associated with wide achievement gaps. However, once tracking is coupled with high vocational enrollment this can remedy the potential adverse effects and reduce the gap by over 1 standard deviation. I use simulations to show that switching to less curricular tracking can help decrease a country’s SES gap by about 11% while switching to more tracking would increase the achievement gap by about 51% percent.",TRUE,FALSE,inequality education|PISA|ses|stratification|tracking|vocational enrollment,2018-07-02T11:12:48.438326,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-21T14:54:45.447581,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/citation/,3mvxa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ej9hv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/relationships/node/,ej9hv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c3d17a594d900251e92d25/,59c3d17a594d900251e92d25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mvxa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3mvxa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3mvxa,NA

Yet, this literature is still predominately focused on developed countries. The goal of this research is to investigate how investments in public transport networks can reshape social and geographical inequalities in access to opportunities in a developing country, using the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) as a case study. Recent mega-events, including the 2014 Football World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, have triggered substantial investment in the city’s transport system. More recently, though, bus services in Rio have been rationalized and reduced as a response to a fiscal crisis and a drop in passenger demand, giving a unique opportunity to look at the distributional effects this cycle of investment and disinvestment have had on peoples’ access to educational and employment opportunities. Based on a before-and-after comparison of Rio’s public transport network, this study uses a spatial regression model and cluster analysis to estimate how accessibility gains vary across different income groups and areas of the city between April 2014 and March 2017. The results show that recent cuts in service levels have offset the potential benefits of newly added public transport infrastructure in Rio. Average access by public transport to jobs and public high-schools decreased approximately 4% and 6% in the period, respectively. Nonetheless, wealthier areas had on average small but statistically significant higher gains in access to schools and job opportunities than poorer areas. These findings suggest that, contrary to the official discourses of transport legacy, recent transport policies in Rio have exacerbated rather than reduced socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities. These results also suggest that future research should consider how the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) can influence the equity assessment of transport projects.",TRUE,FALSE,Accessibility|distributive justice|Equity|mega-events|Rio de Janeiro|Spatial scale|transport policy,2018-07-02T11:12:48.224037,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-21T14:44:29.385740,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,Rafae H M Pereira,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/citation/,cghx2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ax9qw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/relationships/node/,ax9qw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c3ca1c6c613b025ae15115/,59c3ca1c6c613b025ae15115,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cghx2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cghx2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cghx2,NA

But what characterizes this relationship? This study investigates social mechanisms explaining how social ties affect well-being through social integration and social influence, and how well-being affects social ties through social selection. We hypothesize that highly integrated individuals–those with more extensive and dense friendship networks–report higher emotional well-being than others. Moreover, emotional well-being should be influenced by the well-being of close friends. Finally, well-being should affect friendship selection when individuals prefer others with higher levels of well-being, and others whose well-being is similar to theirs. We test our hypotheses using longitudinal social network and well-being data of 117 individuals living in a graduate housing community. The application of a novel extension of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for ordered networks (ordered SAOMs) allows us to detail and test our hypotheses for weak- and strong-tied friendship networks simultaneously. Results do not support our social integration and social influence hypotheses but provide evidence for selection: individuals with higher emotional well-being tend to have more strong-tied friends, and there are homophily processes regarding emotional well-being in strong-tied networks. Our study highlights the two-directional relationship between social ties and well-being, and demonstrates the importance of considering different tie strengths for various social processes.",TRUE,FALSE,emotional well-being|ordered stochastic actor-oriented models|social influence|social integration|Social Networks|social selection|weak ties|well-being,2018-07-02T11:12:46.969576,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-20T15:06:45.558517,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Network Science|Cambridge University Press,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/citation/,ayu6k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b4drp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/relationships/node/,b4drp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c283346c613b025be0fd1f/,59c283346c613b025be0fd1f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ayu6k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ayu6k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ayu6k,https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2017.20

Citizen science goals include enhancing scientific knowledge generation, contributing to societally relevant questions, fostering scientific literacy in society and transforming science communication. These aims, however, are rarely evaluated, and project managers as well as prospective funders are often at a loss when it comes to assessing and reviewing the quality and impact of citizen science activities. To ensure and improve the quality of citizen science outcomes evaluation methods are required for planning, self-evaluation and training development as well as for informing funding reviews and impact assessments. Here, based on an in-depth review of the characteristics and diversity of citizen science activities and current evaluation practices, we develop an open framework for evaluating diverse citizen science activities, ranging from projects initiated by grassroots initiatives to those led by academic scientists.  The framework incorporates the social, the scientific and the socio-ecological/economic perspectives of citizen science and thus offers a comprehensive collection of indicators at a glance. Indicators on a process- and impact-level can be selected and prioritized from all three perspectives, according to the specific contexts and targets.

Existing research assumes that such restrictions are accepted as a quid pro quo for resolving the problem of double taxation, which might act as an obstacle to inward investment. This paper uses archival documents to examine treaty negotiations between the United Kingdom (UK) and developing countries during the 1970s, focusing on contentious provisions concerning ‘tax sparing’, the taxation of shipping, and withholding taxes. Consistent with critical literature on tax treaties, it finds that neither side was concerned about the double taxation problem, which was resolved unilaterally by the UK’s tax credit. Rather, developing countries were primarily focused on obtaining matching tax credits in the UK to maximise the benefits to investors from their tax incentives. UK priorities, meanwhile, were to bind developing countries into OECD-type tax treatment of British firms. Negotiated outcomes did not reflect the true balance of costs and benefits to each side, but their different negotiating capacities, the political salience of particular taxes, and the precedent certain concessions might set for future negotiations",TRUE,FALSE,Developing countries|Double taxation|Foreign direct investment|International tax|Tax|United Kingdom,2018-07-02T11:12:46.811507,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-20T12:33:11.745771,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c13|Law|Tax Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdf|Arts and Humanities|History|Legal|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/citation/,qwjrx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r26bx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/relationships/node/,r26bx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c25d6d9ad5a1025fb34940/,59c25d6d9ad5a1025fb34940,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwjrx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qwjrx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qwjrx,NA

Birthright citizenship, reproductive futurism, and the “panic” over Chinese birth tourism in southern California","In September 2012, residents of Chino Hills, California—a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles—exposed a maternity hotel in their city. Subsequently, controversy erupted as protesting residents argued that Chinese birth tourism is an immigration loophole, where foreigners took advantage of jus soli birthright citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This paper uses this controversy as a springboard to explore how temporalities—both the past and the future—come to shape politics in the present. Considering reproductive futurism in the contexts of citizenship and migrations, this paper argues that the figure of the fetal citizen emerges as the defining site of struggle between preserving, or exposing, the fantasy of a national future. Reports of panic over Chinese birth tourism, then, show how “backwards” racialized citizenship is continually brought to this present struggle, especially vis-a-vis discourses of the “worthy immigrant” and “anchor babies”, to determine who may give birth to citizens in the U.S.",TRUE,FALSE,birthright citizenship|birth tourism|critical media studies|immigration|reproductive futurism|temporality,2018-07-02T11:12:46.746130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-20T10:35:05.159194,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/citation/,s3rgq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y8qhm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/relationships/node/,y8qhm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c243c0594d900253e8a37e/,59c243c0594d900253e8a37e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3rgq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s3rgq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s3rgq,https://doi.org/10.1177/0263775816679832
