We incorporate both unmarried sex ratios and the economic status of unmarried men within each racial group, using multilevel logistic models. We find higher marriage odds in markets with more (same-race) unmarried men, holding constant women’s own characteristics. In addition, for White women only, local men’s education and employment rates also predict higher odds of women’s first marriage. The findings imply that if White and Black women experienced similar unmarried sex ratios in their local markets, the gap in first marriage rates would be much smaller.

In this paper, I ask how exposure to mortgage default through social networks affects perceptions of the housing market, judgements about the strategic default behavior of other households and expectations for homeownership. Although individuals purposively draw on information from their social networks to aid in their housing search, theories of social influence have yet to be applied to the negative experience of mortgage delinquency or default.  Drawing on the National Housing Survey, I find that individuals exposed to mortgage delinquency through their social networks express more negative expectations for the housing market and hold a more permissive opinion about strategic default.  Homeowners reporting network exposure to mortgage strain are more likely to prefer rental housing when they next move. These results are strongest when individuals are connected to someone who has fallen behind on a mortgage payment in the previous three months.",TRUE,FALSE,homeownership|housing|mortgage delinquency|mortgage strain|social networks,2018-07-02T11:48:42.291200,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-18T13:19:31.306368,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Brian J.

This review of the literature identifies three mechanisms—opportunity, motivation, and ability—through which individuals, groups and organizations learn from failure, and it bridges the gaps between different levels of analysis. Opportunity to learn from failure mostly takes the shape of more information about errors and failures that are generated by one's own and others' prior failures or near-failures. Motivation to learn from failure is hindered by punitive leaders and organizations. Finally, ability to learn from failure partly relies on inherent attitudes and characteristics; but can be further developed through thoughtful analysis and transfers of successful routines. Our review leads us to distinguish between erroneous versus correct processes and adverse versus successful outcomes to better understand the full gamut of events that are faced by organizations. We identify the existence of noisy learning environment, where spurious successes (when erroneous processes still lead to successful outcomes) and spurious failures (when correct processes are combined with adverse outcomes) lower the opportunity to learn. Considering noisy learning situations is helpful when understanding the differences between slow- and fast-learning environments.

In this analysis however we compare Urban, Rural and Migrant Chinese populations to illustrate how comparisons between Europe and China are often over simplistic and misguided. Our results suggest that co-residence in Urban China, whilst higher than in Europe, shares similar dynamics with European Families relative to families in Rural China or among migrant populations.

Explicit prejudice, a direct measure based in beliefs about the group-level inferiority of Blacks, is used less frequently. We investigate whether these attitudes pre- dict anti-Black discrimination and evaluations of the fairness of intergroup inequality. Study 1 used the Ultimatum Game (UG) to obtain a behavioral measure of racial discrimination and found whites engaged in anti-Black discrimination. Explicit prejudice explained which whites discriminated whereas resentment did not. In Study 2, white third-party observers evaluated intergroup interactions in the UG and explicit prejudice explained racially biased fairness evaluations, but resentment did not. This demonstrates that resentment and prejudice are distinct constructs, and that explicit prejudice has clear behavioral implications. We also find that explicit prejudice is widespread among white Americans and significantly less partisan than resentment.",TRUE,FALSE,american politics|discrimination|experiment|fairness|political behavior|prejudice|public opinion|racial resentment|racism|resentment|symbolic racism|ultimatum game,2018-07-02T11:48:52.030592,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-18T00:27:39.074689,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/1Y2DLT,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/citation/,qwusz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2wsez/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/relationships/node/,2wsez,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad4f62dc148380010d8264e/,5ad4f62dc148380010d8264e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qwusz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qwusz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qwusz,https://doi.org/10.1086/711558

The total count decreased from 1,101 in the 2011-2015 edition, to 599 in the 2012-2016 edition. An analysis by disciplines is carried out to detect which ones have been affected the most. After considering several hypothesis to explain this phenomenom, we conclude that the main cause was the sudden disappearance of the Spanish bibliographic database Dialnet from Google Scholar. Since Dialnet is the only place online that provides information about an important number of Spanish journals (which do not have any other sort of online exposure), being dropped by Google Scholar meant that all these Spanish journals which had been previously indexed in Google Scholar Metrics became suddenly invisible.",TRUE,FALSE,Coverage|Dialnet|Google Scholar|Google Scholar Metrics|Indexing|Institutional repositories|Journals|Open Access,2018-07-02T11:48:51.945447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-18T00:30:10.691716,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Cataloging and Metadata,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/citation/,7taqn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j8wm7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/relationships/node/,j8wm7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad4e531c148380010d80981/,5ad4e531c148380010d80981,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7taqn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7taqn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7taqn,NA

We ask: “Related to The Fappening, what manhood acts are employed in virtual social space?” Using search terms for “fappening” or “#thefappening”, we collected 100 tweets per hour from August 31 to October 1, 2014 (Average: 1700/day). Coding and qualitative analyses of a sub-sample of tweets (N=9750) reveal four virtual manhood acts commonly employed to claim elevated status in the heterosexist hierarchy and reproduce gendered inequality. These acts include: 1) creation of homosocial, heterosexist space 2) sexualization of women 3) signaling possession of a heterosexual, male body and 4) humor as a tool of oppression. This article introduces the concept of “virtual manhood acts” and contributes to growing understandings of the reproduction of manhood and the oppression of women in online social spaces.",TRUE,FALSE,gender equality|hegemonic masculinity|identity|manhood acts|patriarchy|technology,2018-07-02T11:48:51.859857,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-16T17:45:31.756659,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Mairead Eastin Moloney and Tony P.
