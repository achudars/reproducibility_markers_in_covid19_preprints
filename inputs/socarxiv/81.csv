It is associated with various other schools and theories like Marxism and poststructuralism, as well. In the field of literature, feminist literary criticism managed to throw away the dust that cumulated on women’s writing and succeeded in raising interest in those forgotten female artists. Some critics in the field of feminism claim that there are no separate spheres, masculine and feminine, whereas others have opted for post-feminist thinking. Some women writers used metafiction to write literary criticism. Therefore, how do Gaskell and Woolf implement metafiction in their stories? Accordingly, this work aims at shedding light on Wives and Daughters by Gaskell and Orlando by Woolf to tackle metafiction from a feminist perspective.

The article aims to demonstrate that The Hairy Ape is not only a play concerning the subject of social classes but also an application of Social Darwinism. It opens up new significant issue to highlight the exploitation, isolation, and alcohol prohibition and women’s role in the society that affected all classes of society in the US. However, a social study proposed that Social Darwinism is the essence for illustrating social classes, the cause of class struggles, and changes to the status of women in America in the 1920s. This paper presents a novel finding that men, as workers, were adversely persecuted, growing numb to their human responses and emotions; they were personified as animals, devoid of intellectual thinking and acting on a level of basic instinct and pack mentality.

Racism is probably one of the most important themes of the work. However, the psychological dimension of this novel is also predominant. This aspect is embodied mainly through the protagonist, Mary Turner. Mary’s troubled experiences and unconscious accumulations cause her much suffering and pain in her adult life. The present study is an attempt to investigate the character of Mary from a psychoanalytic perspective. It aims to shed light on the variables that overlap during Mary’s successive life stages to end up in her being murdered. In other words, the study analyses how the accumulated experiences of Mary’s childhood past, reinforced by present hardships, led her to develop psychological complexes and act upon them to end in her tragic death. This study is important in the sense that it may help explaining numerous psychological disorders by referring them to childhood events and socio-cultural factors. In other words, the present study builds on the following question: to what extent childhood events and socio-cultural troubles could lead to psychological traumas and disorders? Briefly, the study findings proved that Mary’s traumatic childhood and its unconscious painful memories were determinant factors to manifest character aberrations like hatred and aggressiveness.

Also, it intends to examine Austen’s creativity in unfamiliar concepts such as women’s freedom of choice and education from a feminist perspective. This study is significant for shedding light on the empowerment of love decision, females’ self-awareness and women’s voice presented in conventional systems. In addition, it will help feminists to figure out the feminism issues reflected in Austen’s work. Further, this study addresses the question of unfamiliar concepts in Austen’s familiar contexts and identify the impact of decision making on women’s equality. The researcher uses textual analysis to discuss main themes and address research questions. The findings of the study show that Austen best novels preached out women’s emancipation of so-called marriage-market. Also, the result indicates that women of her time postulated love in marriage for achieving self- recognition and self-esteem through creative technique of familiarizing unfamiliar concepts.

The paper serves as an attempt to fill two gaps; presenting Saudi identity from a Saudi perspective and examining the Saudi translators’ agency. To fill these gaps, the following question is raised: what is the role of the Saudi translators when translating Orientalists’ accounts about Arabia to reconstruct the image of Saudi Arabia? The paper aims to examine the prevailing practices of Saudi translators of Orientalists’ writings about Arabia into Arabic. The paper adopts Bourdieu’s apparatus of doxa, and Genette’s conception of peritexts to analyze the practices of three Saudi academics/translators in Saudi History; namely, ‘Abd Allah Al ‘Askar, ‘Abd Allah Al-‘Uthaymīn, and ‘Uwaīdah Al Juhany. The argued misrepresentation of Saudi Arabia within Orientalists’ writings led Saudi academics/translators to adopt deconstruction as a doxic critique in the peritexts of their TTs to reconstruct the image of the Self (i.e., Saudi Arabia), and hence overturn the Other’s (i.e., Orientalists’) narratives. Owing to the Saudi academics/translators’ ability to compare historical sources and evaluate Orientalists’ assumptions about the Kingdom, one of the rules of the game is that deconstruction is practiced by these academics. Saudi academics/translators perceive such a practice as a national service, considering that, through their peritexts, they grant Saudi Arabia an opportunity to represent itself through its own voice. This doxic practice presents Saudi translators, not as servants of the STs, but rather as authors, with something to say about their national identity.",TRUE,FALSE,Bourdieu|deconstruction|doxa|Orientalist writings|peritexts|Saudi translators’ agency,2020-11-10T01:04:43.228844,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T01:04:12.316010,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/citation/,e2bvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa45cd09c4dcb01a3e474ea/,5fa45cd09c4dcb01a3e474ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2bvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2bvx/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no4.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2bvx

Based on Bourdieu’s assumption that individuals’ practices result from the interwoven relation between their habitus and the field in which they grow up and work, ʿAbd al-Fattāḥ Ṣabrī’s translation of Gulliver’s Travels (1909) was chosen as a testing ground, through which this assumption will be proven or rejected. This paper aims to contribute to the growing area of sociological research by contextualizing this translation within its socio-cultural context. To carry out this analysis, Bourdieu’s concepts – field, habitus, and doxa – are used as research tools to understand the relationship between the decisions a translator makes at the micro-level and the stimuli at the macro-level. This entails examining the genesis of the field of children’s literature in Egypt during the late nineteenth century to identify the prevalent doxic practices that conditioned cultural productions. It also requires focussing on the socio-political factors that influenced the translator’s habitus. The analysis is expected to determine to what extent the decisions taken at the textual level were affected by both the prevalent doxic practices and the translator’s habitus. This research concludes that the habitus may exert powerful effects on the translator’s strategic decisions to a greater extent than the prevalent doxic practices in the field. Examining the influences of the translator’s habitus in the translation has produced some results worthy of further analysis. It may be possible to expand on this study by including different genres in the same field, such as fantasy books for children. The same sociological theory also could be applied to other genres outside the field of children’s literature, such as the translation of political books.",TRUE,FALSE,A Bourdieusian Account|Children’s Classics|field|habitus|translated Gulliver’s Travels (1909),2020-11-10T01:04:42.218439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T01:04:24.783671,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/citation/,vw6ez,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa45c119c4dcb019ee46e13/,5fa45c119c4dcb019ee46e13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw6ez/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vw6ez/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no4.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vw6ez

These plays are Tennyson’s Becket, Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral, and Anouilh’s Becket, or the Honour of God.  The study examines the three plays in the light of their manipulation of the details of Thomas Becket’s contest with Henry II.  The shifting relationship between the two men raised fascinating questions that were considered useful materials for playwrights.  From the narrow confines of historical conflict, each of the three writers presented a unique artwork of a different dramatic vision.  Through shedding light on the tale of the murder of Thomas Becket, this study highlights the significance of his fatal conflict with King Henry II to each of the three dramatists.  First, it investigates how Tennyson’s primary purpose was to write a work of “documentary” authenticity.  Then, this paper clarifies how Eliot’s interpretation of the play is a religious symbolic one.  It also explores how Anouilh’s employed the Becket tale to present his perspective of the dilemma of twentieth-century man.  Thus, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the different interpretations of the story in the three plays are not only distinctive in themselves but are also, in varying degrees, relating the past to the present.",TRUE,FALSE,Anouilh’s Becket|Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral|Historical Thomas Becket|Twentieth-century man’s dilemma,2020-11-10T01:05:02.015631,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T01:04:40.285770,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/citation/,kbu3p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa45b4c23568c0190d64e67/,5fa45b4c23568c0190d64e67,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbu3p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kbu3p/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no4.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kbu3p

To this end, four of Shakespeare’s Mediterranean plays Othello, the Moor of Venice (1603), The Merchant of Venice (1596), The Tempest (1611), and Cymbeline (1611) are taken understudy. By considering the Postcolonial historicist approach developed by literary scholars such as Stephen Greenblatt and Edward Said, the research argues that the issues of imperial relationships in Shakespeare are not solely centered on the transatlantic colony of Virginia, but it was also extended to the Mediterranean basin. The latter, during Tudor England and, later, Stuart Britain had much more trade and diplomatic activity than on the Atlantic seaboard. This economic activity created a cosmopolitan zone of contact wherein people of the Orient elbowed people from the West. This encounter gave rise to a pre-modern form of Orientalism, which is reflected in Shakespeare’s celebration of marital-cum-political endogamous relationships in his four plays mentioned earlier.",TRUE,FALSE,British Empire|endogamy|exogamy|Mediterranean world|political alliances|representation|Shakespeare’s plays|‘Turk’,2020-11-10T01:05:21.028534,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T01:04:55.914609,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/citation/,f4q7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa45a24a5bb9d01670a1c82/,5fa45a24a5bb9d01670a1c82,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f4q7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f4q7c/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no4.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f4q7c

Shakespeare’s texts are rife with metaphoric language which serves multiple functions on the cognitive, cultural, pragmatic as well as stylistic levels. This paper aims to analyse the translation of literary metaphors from a stylistic perspective in Mohamed Enani’s version of Othello. The analysis is conducted in the framework of conceptual metaphor theory which provides a microscopic description of how metaphors are influenced by the translation process. The findings of the analysis unveil the translation strategy adopted by Enani to reflect the stylistic function of metaphors while preserving their cognitive content and reveals that translating metaphors is influenced by the cognitive and professional background of the translator. Amplification emerges as a successful translation strategy which is used to extend metaphors creatively thus adding cognitive value to the Source Text content and compensating for a possible loss in the style of the Target Text. This paper concludes that, contrary to the prevalent assumptions, a source-text-oriented approach can deliver an accurate yet stylistically-functional translation if the translator is creative enough and willing to exert an additional cognitive effort similar to that exerted by the original writer. Enani’s translations of Shakespeare into Arabic are worth a life-long research project on the translation of style in literature.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-10T01:06:01.164147,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T01:05:12.690687,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/citation/,gcyxv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa4594b9c4dcb01a3e46ae6/,5fa4594b9c4dcb01a3e46ae6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gcyxv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gcyxv/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no4.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gcyxv
