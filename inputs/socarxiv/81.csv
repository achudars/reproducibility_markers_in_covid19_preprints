The literature on the subject appears to zero down the issue of Local Government fiscal autonomy to a political ‘devil’. The position of existing scholarship on the subject concludes that by taking advantage of Sections 7 and 162 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, it is common practice for the State Governors to usurp the autonomy of the Local Governments. The Governors are also accused of using the Joint Account framework to control the statutory allocations of the Local Governments. Hence, Local Governments in Nigeria lacks fiscal autonomy which is one of the main principles of the three tiers of government structure. However, the underlying politics that has played out in the Fourth Republic in Nigeria reveals that this historical and legalistic perception does not provide a complete explanation of the problem. This is because the literature does not consider the role of the political elite at the Local Government level in sustaining the shrewd nature of State and Local Governments interaction in Nigeria’s Federal structure, rather the existing literature focused entirely on the governor as a ‘devil’ and ignores the role of the political class at the grassroots level as “lying angels”. This paper is therefore an invitation for a deeper theoretical deconstruction of this phenomenon to stimulate an encompassing and interesting perceptive on what we conceptualize as State-Local Government Interactions in Nigeria (SLIN). Our primary objective is to draw attention to the role of the personalities of the political class at the grassroots level which makes up the highest cadre of the hierarchy in the Local Government in shaping SLIN. We present a case that future debates should go beyond “devil” and also focus on the profound role of “lying angels”.",TRUE,FALSE,Federalism|Fiscal Autonomy|Local Government|Nigeria|Rural Development|State-Local Government Interaction,2021-02-25T13:18:22.328128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T13:17:57.702474,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/citation/,r7jz8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/relationships/node/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60346f2c88ea1a0461eebdf8/,60346f2c88ea1a0461eebdf8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7jz8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r7jz8/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.01.257,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r7jz8

In trying to review the support and outrage of Bill 10 on Twitter, this article uses thematic analysis to investigate 600 Bill 10-related tweets from 21st June 2019 to 21st June 2020 that were retweeted at least 500. The statistical cybermetrics and thematic approaches used generated quick insights into widely resonating subjects of Bill 10 related issues at the time of debate in Zambia. The findings in this article are highly suggestive of the value of Twitter for disseminating information and in this case more especially about understandings, contents and contexts of governance issues of Bill 10. Twitter also offered or requested for support, the ability of many citizens with divergent views and different political affiliations to adjust to the process of the amendment of Bill 10, and information about the contents of the Bill in Zambia. This article highlights, that as gathered from Twitter, it is key to entrench fundamental principles in constitution amendment processes and such principles in a constitutional text, the idea is to firmly embed them, making them very difficult for any governing body to change for their own advantage. Bill 10 retweets shows that amendment procedures are vital for the protection of the underlying constitutional principles, and are generally considered to have a somewhat unassailable status. As shown by many tweets analysed, a government supporting amendment to the constitutional amendment procedure, could in itself be considered an abuse of power.",TRUE,FALSE,Bill 10|constitution|retweeting|social media|thematic analysis|Twitter|Zambia,2021-02-23T08:18:02.830372,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-23T08:17:45.825733,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/citation/,ba4me,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/relationships/node/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60346cca4ad52e04816e2937/,60346cca4ad52e04816e2937,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ba4me/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ba4me/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.01.256,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ba4me

The article interprets this 'energetic productivism' in terms of indirect geopolitical competition. While this form of competition clearly did not rule out national conflicts over resources and territories, it created a new medium––the national power economy––via which supremacy could be asserted. The article outlines the roots of energetic productivism in the 19th century and shows how it related to imperial competition around the turn of the century. It presents two forms of energetic productivism that emerged out of two distinct nation states, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. On the basis of these examples, the article argues that ‘power competition’ was wedded to two wider political conflicts. The first was between Great Britain and ‘rising’ rival powers whose ascendence was beginning to end its industrial and political hegemony. The second power competition occurred between the Soviet Union and the capitalist countries whom this experimental new polity sought to supersede. The article concludes by contrasting these two iterations of energetic productivism with a more well-known formulation of energetic statehood proposed in the US in the 1930s.",TRUE,FALSE,british empire|energy history|imperialism|soviet union|technocracy|world politics,2021-02-25T13:21:41.041671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-25T13:20:49.558270,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce3|Arts and Humanities|History|European History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/citation/,pq82b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60342a9688ea1a042ceee899/,60342a9688ea1a042ceee899,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pq82b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pq82b/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pq82b

An analysis of decision making among vulnerable populations in Florida during Hurricane Irma.,"Natural disasters preparedness measures are of paramount importance in reducing fatalities, economic tolls, and health concerns for vulnerable populations. One such preparedness measure that policymakers can take is issuing an evacuation order. Our study focuses on vulnerable populations including people in low lying areas, flood evacuation zones, low income communities, sparsely populated areas, and in manufactured or mobile homes. We analyze the evacuation decision and distance of over 170,000 individuals using passively collected location-based service (LBS) data in Florida before, during and after Hurricane Irma. We control for evacuation order, evacuation order date, and storm path. The results of the analysis are in line with hurricane evacuation studies using survey data, which provides validation that using big data can be a reliable and efficient method to analyze hurricane evacuation decision making. Our major findings are that (1) individuals issued a mandatory order are far more likely to evacuate than if given a voluntary order, (2) manufactured and mobile home residents are more likely to evacuate short distances than site-built home residents but less likely to evacuate longer distances, (3) people living in low income census tracts were less likely to evacuate longer distances than those in higher income census tracts and (4) population, employment and road density were positively associated with decision to evacuate. The authors recommend that policies and hurricane preparation measures pay particular attention to less densely populated and low-income regions as these were identified as vulnerable areas that were less likely to evacuate.",TRUE,FALSE,evacuations|natural disasters|Passively collected location-based services data|vulnerable populations,2021-02-23T08:17:17.296390,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-23T08:16:41.777365,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/citation/,d9hw8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6034243c34d304046de3f1d0/,6034243c34d304046de3f1d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9hw8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d9hw8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d9hw8

We argue that exile not only fragments opposition movements but fundamentally alters how they express opposition, because it internationalizes their networks and removes them from day-to-day life under the regime. Providing the first large-scale, quantitative study of the effects of exile on online dissent, we show that after exile Venezuelan activists 1) increase discussion of and support for foreign-led solutions to Venezuela’s political and economic crisis—including military intervention, sanctions, and diplomacy; 2) decrease discussion of local political dynamics; and 3) express harsher criticisms of the Maduro regime. Our analysis of over 5 million tweets sent by 357 activists over seven years suggests that the internationalization of networks is one mechanism by which exile shapes how activists communicate. After exile, activists increase their interactions with foreign entities and international actors and tweet in English at higher rates.

First of all, most data-sets utilized for multilevel modeling include only a small number (N&lt;30) of macro-level units, and therefore, the estimated models have a small number of degrees of freedom on the country level. If models are correctly specified paying regard to the small, level-2 N, only a few macro-level indicators can be controlled for. Furthermore, the introduction of random slopes and cross-level interaction effects is then hardly possible. Consequently, (1) these models are likely to suffer from omitted variable bias regarding the country-level estimators, and (2) the advantages of multilevel modeling cannot be fully exploited.
The fixed effects approach is a valuable alternative to the application of conventional multilevel methods in country-comparative analyses. This method is also applicable with a small number of countries and avoids the country-level omitted variable bias through controlling for country-level heterogeneity. Following common practice in panel regression analyses, the moderator effect of macro-level characteristics can be estimated also in fixed effects models by means of cross-level interaction effects. Despite the advantages of the fixed effects approach, it is rarely used for the analysis of cross-national data.
In this paper, I compare the fixed effects approach with conventional multilevel regression models and give practical examples using data of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) from 2006. As it turns out, the results of both approaches regarding the effect of cross-level interactions are similar. Thus, fixed effects models can be used either as an alternative to multilevel regression models or to assess the robustness of multilevel results.",TRUE,FALSE,Fixed Effects regression|multilevel regression|Random Effects regression,2021-02-22T13:16:10.106311,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-22T12:01:37.721270,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Katja Möhring,2012,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/citation/,3xw7v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60338f2688ea1a03e7eea77f/,60338f2688ea1a03e7eea77f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3xw7v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3xw7v/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3xw7v

Although location-based services (LBS) and other mobile technology have rapidly grown in recent years, it can be challenging to infer meaningful places from such data, which - compared to conventional datasets – can be devoid of context. Existing approaches are often developed ad-hoc and can lack transparency and reproducibility. To address this, we introduce an R software package for inferring home locations from LBS data. The package implements pre-existing algorithms and provides building blocks to make writing algorithmic ‘recipes’ more convenient. We evaluate this approach by analyzing a de-identified LBS dataset from Singapore that aims to balance ethics and privacy with the research goal of identifying meaningful locations. We show that ensemble approaches, combining multiple algorithms, can be especially valuable in this regard as the resulting patterns of inferred home locations closely correlate with the distribution of residential population. We hope this package, and others like it, will contribute to an increase in use and sharing of comparable algorithms, research code and data. This will increase transparency and reproducibility in mobility analyses and further the ongoing discourse around ethical big data research.",TRUE,FALSE,comparison and reproducibility|identifying home locations|location-based services (LBS)|R package|Twitter,2021-02-22T16:05:50.421567,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-22T16:05:32.377277,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/spatialnetworkslab/homelocator|https://github.com/spatialnetworkslab/identifying-meaningful-locations,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/citation/,k3jp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/603310084ad52e03b66e27ed/,603310084ad52e03b66e27ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k3jp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k3jp2/,https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2021.1887489,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k3jp2

Contrary to the dominant paradigm of civil-military relations in the West, civil-military relations in Vietnam follow a very different logic, that of the Leninist system. The relationship between the military and the party-state in Vietnam is characterized by mutual embeddedness. This is not a zero-sum game as the concept of civilian control implies. In the Leninist system, the military's politicization, political influence and involvement in politics are critical for the Communist Party's hegemony. The Party's absolute, direct, and comprehensive control of the military is the core of civil-military relations in the Leninist system. However, Party control is a reciprocal relationship that gives military leaders more say and more privileges than they would have under more democratic conditions. This reciprocity explains the system’s endurance as well as its internal stability. The Vietnam People's Army is deeply politicized and the political control of the military serves the interests of both the Party and the military leadership. Barring a major political reform in the Vietnam Communist Party itself, the Vietnam People's Army will remain more political than professional and commercial.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil-military relations|Vietnam|Vietnamese Politics,2021-02-20T23:39:44.669796,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-20T23:39:16.467881,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Military and Veterans Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Defense and Security Studies",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/citation/,4a9z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60316ca64ad52e021e6e180d/,60316ca64ad52e021e6e180d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4a9z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4a9z7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4a9z7

Class-Biased Economic Reporting in the United States,"There is substantial evidence that voters’ choices are shaped by assessments of the state of the economy and that these assessments, in turn, are influenced by the news. But how does the economic news track the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality? Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of U.S. news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households, with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further, we present evidence that this “class bias” emerges not from pro-rich journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the media’s focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the relationship between economic growth and distribution. The findings yield a novel explanation of distributionally perverse electoral patterns and demonstrate how the structure of the economy conditions economic accountability.",TRUE,FALSE,Income Inequality|Journalism|Media|Newspapers|Political Economy,2021-02-20T19:19:40.913705,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-20T19:19:30.847261,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q9E8RF,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/citation/,rdx6u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/85cfr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/relationships/node/,85cfr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60315b1888ea1a020feedee3/,60315b1888ea1a020feedee3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdx6u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rdx6u/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rdx6u
