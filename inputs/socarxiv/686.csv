I find that religiosity is clearly gendered, but in different ways for women and men. Consistent with the feminine-typing of religion in the Christian-majority context of the United States, gender expression is linked with more religiousness among women but not men. Consistent with religion being a sometimes patriarchal institution, those with more pride in being men are more religious.

Contrary to the standard assumption that income is proportional to productivity, I hypothesize that income is most strongly determined by social power, 	as indicated by one's  position within an institutional hierarchy.  While many theorists have proposed a connection between personal income and power, this paper is the first to quantify this relation. I propose that  power can be quantified in terms of the number of subordinates below one's position in a hierarchy. Using this definition, I find that relative income within firms scales strongly with hierarchical power.  I also find that hierarchical power has a stronger effect on income than any other factor for which data is available.

In this sense, it explores the world of Arab women and investigates aspects of taboos surrounding their issues and language use. In other terms, the focal point of this paper is centered on the linguistic devices that females employ to express taboos. This paper also evaluates women’s discourse and the reasons that keep their lives surrounded by mystery and ambiguity. Hence, Arab females’ issues and language are investigated in the light of the stereotypes Westerners have about the Islamic religious beliefs. Our study further explores the lexicon related to females’ topics like virginity, menstruation, menopause and their body parts. To this vein, a thorough examination was made depending on the informants’ gender, age and their sociocultural background with the support of a structured questionnaire, a focus group interview and participant observation. The findings demonstrate that Algerian females’ issues are directed by the cultural norms of their society.

The study compares between Saudi learners and native speakers in their use of discourse markers and to investigate similarities and differences between the two groups. The results support previous studies as the analysis proves that Saudi learners overuse discourse markers. They have been used unnecessarily and redundantly.

In general, since second language learners experience difficulties with grammatical tenses, these dictogloss tasks (which were developed by Wajnryb (1990) and preformed either with pairs or small groups) were utilized to find out whether their application lead to better performance on grammar tests, particularly in regard to verb tense accuracy. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of using the dictogloss task procedure on female Translation university students enrolled in Grammar (1) at the College of Languages and Translation (COLT), King Saud University (KSU), Riyadh. The study also aimed to survey participants' attitudes and perceptions toward the application of dictogloss tasks. The researcher applied a quasi-experimental design model and survey research. The findings of the study demonstrated that in general, there was no significant statistical difference in verb-tense performance between the three groups’ weekly test scores that were immediately administered after presenting dictogloss tasks, but most students, in both experimental groups, expressed satisfaction with the dictogloss task as a whole. It is recommended that future researchers investigate whether and to what extent FonF tasks, such as the dictogloss, are effective for the different proficiency levels for which they are intended to appropriately generalize the findings to other contexts and/or language skills, and identify how instruction and reinforcement can be best designed to promote second language learning.",TRUE,FALSE,dictogloss|focus on form|FonF|grammar|traditional exercises,2018-07-02T11:03:34.816809,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:29:57.925478,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/citation/,t826f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wrkc7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/relationships/node/,wrkc7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972d42b9ad5a1023755cfef/,5972d42b9ad5a1023755cfef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t826f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t826f,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.24

The present study adopts a quantitative research design. Therefore, the main instruments are questionnaires, and English achievement tests. Both the questionnaires and language tests are analyzed and interpreted quantitatively. The reliability of the questionnaire sections and scales as well as tests constructs matches the criterion for acceptable internal consistencies (α=70). The statistical tools used in order to help analyze and interpret data include descriptive and inferential statistics which make use of frequencies, percentage, and Correlation tests. Following what has been hypothesized; the test results do not support the four research hypotheses claiming there is no statistically significant relationship between the VLS, ALS, KLS, and R/WLS and students’ level of EA. The findings of the present study highlight some implications to improve students’ achievement in English with the help of e-learning style preference.",TRUE,FALSE,computer-based learning|educational technology|English achievement|learning styles|sensory modality|VARK strategies,2018-07-02T11:03:34.773277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:26:18.477604,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/citation/,yh538,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7teqn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/relationships/node/,7teqn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972d34bb83f6902293019c9/,5972d34bb83f6902293019c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh538/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yh538/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yh538,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.23

This research aims to explore the Saudi learners’ perceptions of speaking anxiety in language classrooms and provide some effective and helpful solutions for reducing it. The sample of this study involved 10 Saudi female students, studying their foundation year at the English Language Institute (ELI), King Abdulaziz University. Their ages range between 18 to 20 years old. To reach a richer insight and better understanding of the research phenomenon, a qualitative approach was conducted. For gathering data, ten semi-structured interviews with ten Saudi female students from levels 102, 103, and 104 were used and then thematically analyzed using Nvivo 10 software. The qualitative data found that Saudi female students do feel worried and anxious in foreign language classrooms when speaking the foreign language. However, they showed a positive attitude and a willingness to improve their English speaking proficiency level as a way of reducing anxiety by watching English movies, using English internet sites, traveling abroad and talking to native speakers, doing more presentations, practice reading English books and joining English institutes during summer vacation.",TRUE,FALSE,foreign language anxiety|reducing speaking anxiety|Saudi EFL learners|speaking anxiety,2018-07-02T11:03:34.714591,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:22:36.344914,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/citation/,w634s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kz2bj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/relationships/node/,kz2bj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972d2479ad5a10238560683/,5972d2479ad5a10238560683,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w634s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w634s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w634s,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.22
