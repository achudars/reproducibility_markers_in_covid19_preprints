Evolutionary scholars have argued that childhood co-residence is one of the most important indirect cues for kinship. While childhood co-residence duration has been found to correlate with kin investment in intragenerational studies (i.e., among siblings), intergenerational investigations considering the association between childhood co-residence duration and kin investment have been scarce. Here, we investigate whether the investment of biological and stepfathers is correlated with childhood co-residence duration. We used data from adolescents and adults (aged 17–19, 27–29, and 37–39 years) from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (Pairfam), wave 2, collected in 2010–2011. Paternal investment was measured as financial and practical help, emotional support, intimacy, and emotional closeness. We found that while stepfathers invested less than biological fathers, both biological and stepfathers’ investments increased with increased childhood co-residence duration in most measures. Financial help correlated with childhood co-residence in stepfathers but not in biological fathers who helped financially more than stepfathers regardless of childhood co-residence duration. Emotional support, intimacy, and emotional closeness were correlated with childhood co-residence in both biological fathers and stepfathers. Practical help did not correlate with co-residence in either father. Thus, our results partially support the hypothesis that childhood co-residence duration serves as a kin detection cue and directs intergenerational altruism.",TRUE,FALSE,family|kin detection|kin investment|parenting|paternal investment|stepfather,2021-05-19T22:49:05.054924,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-19T22:48:41.512891,FALSE,NA,no,Pairfam: https://www.pairfam.de/en/data/data-access/,,no,No preregistration,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Jenni E.

Developing and evaluating indicators measuring inequalities in pedestrian accessibility can help planners and policymakers benchmark and monitor the progress of city planning interventions. However, measuring and assessing indicators of urban design and transport features at high resolution worldwide to enable city comparisons is challenging due to limited availability of official, high quality, and comparable spatial data, as well as spatial analysis tools offering customizable frameworks for indicator construction and analysis. To address these challenges, this study develops an open source software framework to construct pedestrian accessibility indicators for cities using open and consistent data. It presents a generalized method to consistently measure pedestrian accessibility at high resolution and spatially aggregated scale, to allow for both within- and between-city analyses. The open source and open data methods developed in this study can be extended to other cities worldwide to support local planning and policymaking.

However, Latinos/as remain underrepresented at four-year universities, and college completion rates and household earnings lag other groups’. Yet, little theoretical attention has been paid to the processes that drive these trends, or to what happens when students not traditionally expected to attend college begin to enroll in large numbers. Longitudinal interviews with 50 Latino/a college aspirants in the San Francisco East Bay Area reveal near-universal college enrollment among these mostly low-income youth, despite significant barriers. East Bay Latino/a youth draw on a set of interrelated logics (economic, regional, family/group, college-for-all) supporting their enrollment, because they conclude that higher education is necessary for socioeconomic mobility. In contrast to the predictions of status attainment and rational choice models, these rationally optimistic college aspirants largely ignore known risks, instead focusing on anticipated gains. Given a postrecession environment featuring increasing costs and uncertain employment, this approach led many to enroll in low-cost, less supportive two-year institutions, resulting in long and winding pathways for some. Results suggest that without structural supports, access to college fails to meaningfully redress stratification processes in higher education and the postrecession economy that significantly shape possibilities for mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,class|education|gender|Latinx sociology|race/ethnicity|racial/ethnic minorities,2021-05-19T22:53:49.229941,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-19T22:53:21.379463,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/citation/,5u6hq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a411802cb36e00a8c13d48/,60a411802cb36e00a8c13d48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6hq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5u6hq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5u6hq,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496516663220

Investigating Researcher Variability in a Crowdsourced Replication,"The paper reports findings from a crowdsourced replication. Eighty-four replicator teams attempted to verify results reported in an original study by running the same models with the same data. The replication involved an experimental condition. A “transparent” group received the original study and code, and an “opaque” group received the same underlying study but with only a methods section and description of the regression coefficients without size or significance, and no code. The transparent group mostly verified the original study (95.5%), while the opaque group had less success (89.4%). Qualitative investigation of the replicators’ workflows reveals many causes of non-verification. Two categories of these causes are hypothesized, routine and non-routine. After correcting non-routine errors in the research process to ensure that the results reflect a level of quality that should be present in ‘real-world’ research, the rate of verification was 96.1% in the transparent group and 92.4% in the opaque group. Two conclusions follow: (1) Although high, the verification rate suggests that it would take a minimum of three replicators per study to achieve replication reliability of at least 95% confidence assuming ecological validity in this controlled setting, and (2) like any type of scientific research, replication is prone to errors that derive from routine and undeliberate actions in the research process. The latter suggests that idiosyncratic researcher variability might provide a key to understanding part of the “reliability crisis” in social and behavioral science and is a reminder of the importance of transparent and well documented workflows.",TRUE,FALSE,Immigration|Meta-Reliability|Noise|Policy Preferences|Replication|Researcher Variability|Secondary Observer Effect,2021-05-18T20:10:43.833095,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-18T20:10:13.545315,FALSE,NA,no,The data contains personal identifiers of the participants.

family process affects youth's educational outcomes in the U.S.
Previous research does not have a conclusive understanding
regarding parental influence and educational achievement.
Some studies determine that some parental influence is
connected with positive academic achievement, while others
conclude that it is not associated with young adults' academic
achievement. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth 1997, an event history analysis was conducted to
address how family process measures (family routines and
parental monitoring) during adolescence change the rates and
timing of the completion of a bachelor's degree. Although
mothers' monitoring does not have a significant relationship with
having an academic degree, higher father monitoring was
positively associated with having the degree. Family routines
provide a complex result. Average family routines are associated
with a higher likelihood of academic achievements, while low and
high family routines have the same outcomes. The research's
findings imply the role of fathers and the multidimensional
nature of the family process, suggesting that the family process is

Neighborhood relations, subjective well-being, and trust during the COVID-19 pandemic","Neighborhoods and neighbors are important sources for people's life chances and well-being. Their importance is highlighted in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic: Neighbors helped vulnerable and at-risk groups by providing small services and a sense of community. Using panel data from Switzerland, this study investigated how and for whom relations with neighbors changed to the better or worse during the pandemic. In a second step, changes in subjective well-being and trust in other people, both of which dropped considerably during the pandemic and social confinement, were linked to changes in neighborly relations. The results show that the negative impact of the pandemic on people's subjective well-being and trust was much less pronounced for those who improved their relations with neighbors during the pandemic. At the same time, those with more resources prior to the pandemic were more likely to improve neighborly relations. Consequently, this study finds evidence for a social gradient in subjective well-being and trust during the crisis that partly works through changes in neighborhood networks. Robustness analyses further show that the documented effects are indeed attributable to changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding social confinement measures.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|neighborhood effects|neighborhood relations|panel data|subjective well-being|trust,2021-05-19T22:51:26.649027,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-19T22:51:09.979449,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/17411/0/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/citation/,etywg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a3ad8e2cb36e0079c139c3/,60a3ad8e2cb36e0079c139c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etywg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/etywg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/etywg,NA

Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in science and policy, but their potential for transformative change remains unexplored. We provide a framework to evaluate how NbS contribute to transformative change and apply it to 93 NbS from mountain social-ecological systems (SES). The framework serves to assess what elements may catalyze transformative change, how transformative change occurs, and what its outcomes are. Our results show that NbS are as much “people based” as “nature based.” Most NbS are based on four elements with transformation potential: nature's values, knowledge types, community engagement, and nature management practices. Our results confirm the potential of NbS for transformative change, observed through changes in non-sustainable trajectories of SES. We illustrate the components of our framework through a novel classification of NbS. The framework provides key components for assessing the effectiveness of NbS and allows tracking long-term transformative change processes.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|ecosystem servcies|knowledge|mountain|nature-based solutions|nature´s contributions to people|participation|social-ecological system|transformative adaptation|transformative change|values,2021-05-19T21:25:09.665742,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-19T21:24:40.238890,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/x4wwzxjm7b/1,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,One Earth,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/citation/,vwde3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a39c96e2a9800087a630ef/,60a39c96e2a9800087a630ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwde3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vwde3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vwde3,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2021.04.013

The impact of parental death on early life mortality and height in the Netherlands 1850-1940,"We investigate how parental death in infancy, childhood and adolescence affects boys’ health using two distinct measures: mortality before age 20 and height in young adulthood. These indicators enable us to identify critical age periods at which parental loss was most harmful for health, and to gain more insights into the mechanisms at play. Employing nationally representative data for the Netherlands for the period 1850-1940, we analyze survival of roughly 18,000 boys using Cox proportional hazard models, and stature of more than 4,000 young men using linear regression models. Results reveal that experiencing parental death in general and maternal death in particular during infancy and in early childhood is strongly associated with increased mortality risk. Among children aged 5-20, however, only paternal death is associated with increased mortality. Young adult height, in contrast, is most strongly affected by parental death taking place between the ages five and 12. While maternal death in this age group is associated with shorter height, paternal death is associated with taller stature among surviving children. Our results demonstrate that both indicators of health complement each other, and suggest that the loss of resources and care traditionally provided by mothers was particularly harmful for child well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,early life conditions|health outcomes|Height|mortality|parental death,2021-05-19T22:49:48.061739,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-19T22:49:23.933562,FALSE,NA,no,Data is available after signing a data sharing agreement with the International Institute of Social History.
