While the doctrine has deep common law and statutory roots, its exact rationale and scope have never been fully explored and articulated. As a result, the law remains somewhat unsettled, in particular with respect to the ability of IP owners to opt-out of the doctrine and with respect to the applicability of the doctrine to situations of parallel importation.

This Article provides answers to these unsettled issues. By applying insights from the economics of post-sale restraints, the Article shows that the main benefits of post-sale restraints involve situations of imperfect vertical integration between coproducing or collaborating firms, which occur during the production and distribution phases or shortly thereafter. In such situations, opting out of the first sale doctrine should be permitted. Beyond such limited circumstances, however, the first sale doctrine promotes important social and economic goals: it promotes efficient long-term use and preservation of goods embodying IP and facilitates user-innovation. Therefore, contrary to some other views, I conclude that the economics of post-sale restraints confirm the validity and support the continued vitality of the first sale doctrine.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:23.897234,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T20:48:34.667000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/citation/,58a4j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7u7v7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/relationships/node/,7u7v7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57894c24594d9001f6859ecb/,57894c24594d9001f6859ecb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58a4j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58a4j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58a4j

According to conventional wisdom, the cost and delay involved in this process diminish the incentives to invest in the development of new drugs. Accordingly, several reforms aimed at restoring such incentives have been implemented and others have been advocated.

This paper challenges the central argument in the debate on the topic, namely that drug regulation and drug innovation are necessarily at odds with each other. Although intuitively appealing, the argument that drug regulation negatively affects the incentives to innovate does not fully capture the role that regulation plays in this industry. This paper shows that the regulatory framework is not solely a burden imposed on the industry; it also provides a valuable service to the industry.

Specifically, drug regulation provides certification of drug quality. Such certification, which may not be easily achieved by private market-based mechanisms, prevents the market from becoming a market for lemons. Therefore, rather than decreasing the expected returns to innovation, this aspect of regulation contributes to the value of new drugs and may actually encourage innovation. This point has largely been absent from most cost-benefit analyses of drug regulation, yet without it any discussion of the merits of regulation is incomplete.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:26.106510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T20:47:49.024000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/citation/,5w8xs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ve6mv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/relationships/node/,ve6mv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57894bf69ad5a101f8f5c46e/,57894bf69ad5a101f8f5c46e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w8xs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5w8xs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5w8xs

It traces the shared common law origins of fair use and fair dealing in English and American copyright law, and shows that the enactment of the 1911 UK Copyright Act - the basis for current copyright laws of most Commonwealth jurisdictions - was not designed to cause any major alteration in the common law of fair dealing. The historical record shows that the distinction between US-style open-ended fair use and fair dealing as a myth: the codification of fair dealing in 1911 was not designed to limit its application to the enumerated purposes included in the statute.

The question of whether the list of enumerated purposes is exhaustive or, instead, illustrative of a broader principle has never been put squarely before the courts, let alone the higher courts, and certainly not in Canada. Therefore, the question of whether fair dealing in Canada can apply to purposes that are not explicitly mentioned in the Copyright Act is an open one, and as this Chapter shows, can and should be answered affirmatively. Doing so will not transplant a foreign legal concept. Rather, it will reunite present copyright doctrine with its rich and historic roots that were latent but never discarded.

We argue that, at least in the context of copyright protection, this conventional wisdom is false. While European antitrust regulation of refusal to license one's intellectual property does seem much more robust and activist than U.S. antitrust regulation of similar conduct, focusing solely on one narrow aspect of antitrust doctrine — the treatment of a unilateral refusal to deal — tells less than half the story.

Once various doctrines of copyright law are taken into account, the substantive difference between the European and American approaches not only narrows, but in some key respects is reversed. While European jurisdictions have relatively expansive copyright protection which may require antitrust intervention to check anti-competitive uses of copyrighted works, American copyright law provides stronger internal limits on copyright protection, which thereby lessens the need for resort to antitrust law as an external check on anti-competitive uses of copyrighted works. Furthermore, when the broader impact that antitrust law might have on the exercise of IPRs in the United States is considered (not only in substance, but also in antitrust process), it becomes apparent that in key respects, when innovative-competition is at stake, U.S. law grants overall weaker copyright protection than that available in Europe.

By providing a concise and unequivocal identifier of the particular source of particular goods, trademarks facilitate the exchange between buyers and sellers, and provide producers with an incentive to maintain their goods and services at defined and persistent qualities.

Working within this paradigm, this Article highlights that reducing search costs and providing incentives to maintain quality are related yet distinct functions and shows that recognizing their distinct nature enriches our understanding of trademark law. The Article first develops a distinction between two functions of trademarks: a linguistic and a trust functions. Then, the Article demonstrates how the distinction provides a matrix for evaluating the normative strength of various trademark rules and doctrines. Under this matrix, rules that promote both functions would be considered normatively strong; rules that promote neither function would be normatively weak; and rules that promote one function but not the other would be normatively ambiguous, their strength depending on the results of a closer cost-benefit analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:05.705888,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T20:38:36.752000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/citation/,z94kq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w3xwh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/relationships/node/,w3xwh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578949ce6c613b01f2347c74/,578949ce6c613b01f2347c74,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z94kq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z94kq

The key finding is that men who served in the US military prior to the advent of All-Volunteer Force (AVF) in 1973 are actually less civically engaged than those who never served. Military service has no significant effect on civic attitudes. These findings represent an especially powerful challenge to the notion that civic participation begets more civic participation. The fact that serving the citizenry through military duty actually decreases one’s subsequent civic involvement indicates that we cannot assume that all forms of civic activity are equally effective at inculcating their participants with civic values and habits.

National Security Agency","*Abstract: *

This case presents pressing questions regarding the executive's power to 
collect, store, and use Americans' telephony and other personal data for 
the purposes of conducting surveillance operations.

In the wake of recent disclosures revealing National Security Agency 
data collection programs, the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles and 
21 other membership and political advocacy organizations filed this 
lawsuit to challenge the NSA's collection of telephony data as an 
infringement of their members' First and Fourth Amendment rights.

In this amicus brief, experts in the history of American surveillance -- 
James Bamford, author of The Puzzle Palace; Peter Fenn, who served as 
Washington Chief of Staff for Senator Frank Church and as a staff member 
to the Senate Intelligence Committee; and Dr. Loch Johnson, who served 
as special assistant to the Church Committee chair and as staff director 
of the House Subcommittee on Intelligence Oversight -- explain the 
historical parallels between the executive surveillance programs that 
are presently coming to light and the development of abusive 
surveillance practices from the 1940s to the 1970s.

All amici were directly involved in the comprehensive review of 
twentieth-century American intelligence operations completed by the 
Church Committee in the 1970s, giving them a uniquely thorough 
understanding of these parallels.

Drawing from the experts’ extensive knowledge, the brief explains the 
clear parallels between the development and growth of the abusive 
practices of the mid-twentieth century -- when American intelligence 
agencies helped conduct politically motivated surveillance of Americans 
ranging from ordinary teachers, journalists and peace activists to civil 
rights leaders, members of Congress, and a Supreme Court justice -- and 
today’s vast surveillance programs. History shows that abusive 
surveillance does not require bad actors to grow and flourish: instead, 
it is the natural outgrowth of too much secrecy and too little oversight 
by other branches of government.

In light of this clear historical pattern, the brief argues that the 
court should carefully apply existing legal limits on the government’s 
surveillance powers to address the risks posed by the executive branch 
and the intelligence agencies’ claims to expansive power to determine 
the limits of their own activities.

In the last decade, São Paulo has witnessed a 70% decline in homicide rates, a result that policy-makers attribute to a series of crime-reducing measures implemented by the state government. While recent academic studies seem to confirm this downward trend, no estimation of the total impact of state policies on homicide rates currently exists. The present article fills this gap by employing the Synthetic Control Method to compare these measures against an artificial São Paulo. The results indicate a large drop in homicide rates in actual São Paulo when contrasted with the synthetic counterfactual, with about 20,000 lives saved during the period. The theoretical usefulness of the Synthetic Control Method for public policy analysis, the role of the Primeiro Comando da Capital as a causal mediator, and the practical implications of the security measures taken by the São Paulo state government are also discussed.

We offer the first comprehensive look at how a district judge’s 
experience affects decisionmaking in patent cases. We find that that 
there is a strong, statistically significant relationship between a 
judge’s experience and case outcome: more experienced judges are less 
likely to rule for the patentee. Notably, the relationship exists for 
rulings finding noninfringement; judicial experience had no relationship 
to the likelihood a judge would find a patent invalid. The relationship 
appears to hold across judges, rather than to be driven by the rulings 
of particular judges. Beyond individual judges, some technologies 
(biotechnology, mechanics) are associated with more patentee wins, while 
patentees are less likely to win computer hardware and software cases. 
Some district courts (Delaware, New Jersey) are more likely to find 
patents infringed. By contrast, perhaps surprisingly, we find no 
significant relationship between litigation in the Eastern District of 
Texas and a judge’s ruling for or against the patentee. Finally, we find 
that suing on multiple patents is associated with an increased 
likelihood that at least one patent will be found to be infringed.

Our results challenge what has been an implicit assumption in the 
literature and discussion that particular districts are biased in a 
particular direction, driving forum shopping. And they test for the 
first time the implicit assumption in the literature, in calls for 
specialized patent trial courts, and in the Patent Pilot Program, that 
experience with patent cases at the trial level will lead to different — 
usually assumed to be “better” — outcomes from what we see from 
generalist courts. Our results suggest that there is a difference, but 
that “better” may be in the eye of the beholder. They suggest some sort 
of learning effect among district court judges across the country, and 
that patentees benefit from litigating before inexperienced judges, at 
least on issues of infringement. Depending on the reason for this 
effect, adoption of a specialized patent trial court might help accused 
infringers but not patentees, raising broader questions about patent 
reform and how to measure the value of an expert court.
