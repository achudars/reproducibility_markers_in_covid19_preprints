In addition, it can be considered a Second Language (L2) teaching method that can increase learner’s engagement and language learning outcomes. Owning to its context-sensitive and culture-dependent nature, however, TSD topics, purposes, and considerations may vary cross-culturally. This study is an endeavor to investigate EFL University teachers' consciousness of suitability and appropriateness of TSD as well as to find out differences and similarities between male and female EFL teachers' conceptions of the relevance of TSD to successful L2 teaching. In order to achieve these objectives, the Appropriateness of Teacher Self-Disclosure Scale is administered to 60 EFL teachers (30 females and 30 males) from the Foreign Languages Departments at the Faculties of Arts and Humanities of Al Baha University, KSA. Results of the current study refer to the extent to which EFL teachers consider TSD topics, purposes, and considerations to be proper or improper. Moreover, the study finds out concurrence and indifference between male and female teachers' conceptions in topics of TSD, the purposes TSD achieves in classroom settings, and considerations the teachers consider when practicing TSD. The results of the study recommend that EFL teachers can use TSD as a teaching and career development tool to improve learning despite the fact that they should be alert of its influences in some features as TSD is culture and context oriented.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL|teacher consciousness|teacher self-disclosure,2018-08-21T13:25:42.175273,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:25:14.930801,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/citation/,7dqkw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z7ahn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/relationships/node/,z7ahn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b5f6f2da7bb001b708999/,5b7b5f6f2da7bb001b708999,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7dqkw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7dqkw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7dqkw

Benchmarks are necessary for improving the quality of instruction. Considering the importance of benchmarking and taking it as a point of reference, a small study was undertaken at the Centre for Preparatory Studies to develop benchmarks for each course offered in the General Foundation Program. One of the aims of developing benchmarks was to make it clear to students what is expected of them at the end of each course. The study draws on some examples of benchmarking models to draft benchmarks for the purpose of study. The exploratory method was followed for gaining insights to write benchmarks. Literature review showed that course objectives are used synonymously with benchmarks. The outcomes of the research project played a significant role in designing curricula for the GFP courses though it was quite a challenging task. It is important to draft concise and clear benchmarks, which are accessible and comprehensible for students and teachers. So, using the level-specific proficiency descriptors, can-do statements for each skill bench markers were written to make it comprehensible for students to know what is expected of them by the end of each course.

It adds authenticity to the work, indicates that the student has read extensively, and upholds academic integrity of the written piece. However, according to the author’s experience of teaching undergraduate level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students, using academic sources and citing references effectively is one of the most daunting features of academic writing. Therefore, this study investigates the challenges faced by students in citing academic sources while composing research based reports and, by the same token, the reasons behind them. It also considers teachers’ observations about these challenges and the strategies that can be adopted to support students. A mixed method approach was used where data were collected through student questionnaires, student focus groups, interviews with faculty members, and students’ assignment reports. The participants included 97 undergraduate-level Engineering students enrolled in three sessions of an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course called Communication Skills. The paper reports on the details of the research-based assignment and the measures used by the author to support students in integrating sources in the report. It was observed that the students found integration of academic sources as the most problematic requirements and features of the assignment. The data revealed that these challenges are direct consequences of students’ linguistic backgrounds; lack of appropriate writing skills; difficulty in comprehending articles due to the technical jargon used; and high word count of the academic papers. In response to that, the author strongly recommends the incorporation of academic literacies in the curricula of specialist courses as well as prompt, closer collaboration between language instructors and subject specialists.

However, engaging Arab EFL learners in ER might be a very difficult task especially when they lack motivation and enthusiasm. Therefore, the current study explores the effects of online ER tools such as M-reader on Arab EFL learners’ motivation to read extensively and autonomously. M-reader is a free online tool which helps educational institutions to manage extensive reading. It supports students to read and understand graded readers by taking online quizzes which are available in its database. The study was conducted on first year college students enrolled in the General Foundation Programme at a private college in Oman where M-reader was introduced for the first time. The study attempted to identify how M-reader motivates Arab EFL learners for extensive reading and how it motivates them to become autonomous learners. To gauge the efficacy of M-reader and to identify the extent to which it has been successful with the selected sample, reading records from M-reader, student participations through questionnaires, focus interviews with top readers, and samples of motivational strategies used by the researcher  were collected and analyzed. Findings revealed the learners’ attitudes towards using M-reader as well as the discrepancies in feedback on whether they have developed an autonomous reading culture following exposure to M-reader.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab EFL learners|extensive reading|General Foundation Programme|learner autonomy|M-reader,2018-08-21T13:31:05.002041,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:30:37.675378,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/citation/,jqpvd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7nwut/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/relationships/node/,7nwut,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b56fcd4676c0017abcaaf/,5b7b56fcd4676c0017abcaaf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqpvd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jqpvd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC1.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jqpvd

Part of the reason is that genre looks like a different thing at different points in the life of a text. Scholars of rhetoric tend to focus on the patterns of communicative action that produce memoranda or tragedies. Sociologists are sometimes more interested in institutions that organize reception. Literary scholars, for their part, have traditionally been preoccupied with the patterning of the texts themselves. Of course, all of these aspects of genre are connected. But it's not easy to describe the connections.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-21T13:30:44.040456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-21T13:30:23.520765,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/citation/,8629m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/urejg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/relationships/node/,urejg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b4373d4676c0017abbfe8/,5b7b4373d4676c0017abbfe8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8629m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8629m/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.005,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8629m

I extend the theorizing on frames by arguing that frame variation can be a response to new agendas and goals of countermovements and opponents. Specifically, for opponents to rights activism, frame variation can be reaction to the assertion of rights for new protagonists, specifically their entry into new spaces. This study analyzes frame variation of the most deleterious child protectionist claims about stranger danger, assertions that the presence of racial, gender, and sexual others in public spaces will harm children. This paper is a content analysis of political flyers and messages developed by Religious Right campaigns at the state and municipal level between 1974 and 2013; these campaigns framed gay men and transgender woman as threats to children in classrooms and bathrooms. For both gay men and transgender women these claims were most common at the start of rights advocacy. I argue that challengers make the most overt, deleterious arguments about harm to children when new groups initially advocate for legal rights and access to new spaces; as marginalized groups become more familiar and less “strange”, challengers make more covert claims about these groups, as stranger danger claims have waning cultural and political resonance.",TRUE,FALSE,framing|gay men|gender|sexuality|social movements|strangers|trans|transgender,2018-08-20T23:55:45.444005,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-20T23:55:30.947565,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/citation/,tb2ks,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/78kud/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/relationships/node/,78kud,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b0e082da7bb0019705b33/,5b7b0e082da7bb0019705b33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tb2ks/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tb2ks/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy077,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tb2ks
