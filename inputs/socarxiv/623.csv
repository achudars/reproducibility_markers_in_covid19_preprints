The experience of working with researcher-produced and/or analysed data shows how social research is a set of practices which can be shared with research participants, and which in key ways draw on everyday habits and performances.  Participant produced data has come to the fore with the popularity of crowdsourced, citizen science research and Games with a Purpose.  These address practical problems and potentially open up the research process to large scale democratic involvement. However at the same time the process can become fragmented and proletarianised. Mass research has a long history, an exemplar of which is the Mass Observation studies. Our research involved participants collecting video data on their intoxication practices.  We discuss how their experience altered their own subject position in relation to these regular social activities, and explore how our understanding of their data collection converged and differed from theirs.

This article compares these two methods by applying them to two common crime-analysis scenarios: focusing resources on the most-important types of crime and in the areas most affected by crime. The two measures are found to produce substantially different results when other factors are held constant.

It is open-access and available here: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-017-9297-8

Ethnic groups are universal and unique to human societies. Such groups sometimes have norms of behavior that are adaptively linked to their social and ecological circumstances, and ethnic boundaries may function to protect that variation from erosion by inter-ethnic interaction. However, such interaction is often frequent and voluntary, suggesting that individuals may be able to strategically reduce its costs, allowing adaptive cultural variation to persist in spite of interaction with out-groups with different norms. We examine five mechanisms influencing the dynamics of ethnically-distinct cultural norms, each focused on strategic individual-level choices in inter-ethnic interaction: bargaining, interaction frequency-biased norm adoption, assortment on norms, success-biased inter-ethnic social learning, and childhood socialization. We use Bayesian item response models to analyze patterns of norm variation and inter-ethnic interaction in an ethnically-structured Amazonian population. We show that, among indigenous Matsigenka, inter-ethnic education with colonial Mestizos is more strongly associated with Mestizo-typical norms than is even extensive inter-ethnic experience in commerce and wage labor. Using ethnographic observations, we show that all five of the proposed mechanisms of norm adoption may contribute to this effect. However, of these mechanisms, we argue that changes in relative bargaining power are particularly important for ethnic minorities wishing to preserve distinctive norms while engaging in inter-ethnic interaction in domains such as education. If this mechanism proves applicable in a range of other ethnographic contexts, it would constitute one cogent explanation for when and why ethnically-structured cultural variation can either persist or erode given frequent, and often mutually beneficial, inter-ethnic interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|Cultural evolution|Education|Ethnic boundaries|Indigenous peoples|Norms,2018-07-02T11:01:24.670982,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-22T11:56:52.442759,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/citation/,62kd9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7q4e5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/relationships/node/,7q4e5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594bae15594d9000458188c9/,594bae15594d9000458188c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62kd9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/62kd9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/62kd9,NA

While the admissions policies of elite institutions get the most political, scholarly, and media attention, little is known about the use of affirmative action in admissions across the broader field of selective higher education. Based on analysis of longitudinal panel data of almost 1,000 selective status colleges and universities, we find a dramatic shift in stated organizational policy starting in the mid-1990s. In 1994, 60% of institutions publicly declared that they considered race in undergraduate admissions; by 2014, just 35% did. Yet there is substantial variation depending on schools’ status (competitiveness) and sector (public or private). Notably, race-conscious admissions remain the stated organizational policy of almost all of the most elite public and private institutions. The retreat from race-conscious admissions occurs largely among schools relatively lower in the status hierarchy: very competitive public institutions and competitive public and private institutions. These patterns are not explained by the implementation of state-level bans.

Chicago: Association of College and Research Libraries, 2015.

Undergraduate students often struggle when asked to locate, evaluate, and use data in their research, and librarians have an opportunity to support them as they learn data literacy skills. Much of the literature on data librarianship in this area focuses on data reference services, but there is a lack of scholarship and guidance on how to translate data reference expertise into effective teaching strategies. In this chapter, the authors will bridge that gap between data reference and information literacy instruction.",TRUE,FALSE,data information literacy|data literacy|statistical literacy,2018-07-02T11:01:24.355290,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-21T14:42:13.562307,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Information Literacy,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/citation/,xur5n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fg8ju/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/relationships/node/,fg8ju,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594a8538594d900242976885/,594a8538594d900242976885,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xur5n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xur5n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xur5n,NA

In critical security studies, the concept’s purview has become increasingly limited by an abiding theoretical and analytical focus on various practices of securitisation. We argue that there is a need to clarify the logic and stakes of different forms of militarism. Critical security scholars have provided valuable insights into the conditions of ‘exceptionalist militarism.’ However, if we accept that militarism and the production of security are co-constitutive, then we have every reason to consider different manifestations of militarism, their historical trajectories and their inter-relationships. To that end, we draw on the work of historical sociologists and articulate three more ideal types of militarism: nation-state militarism, civil society militarism, and neoliberal militarism. We suggest this typology can more adequately capture key transformations of militarism in the modern period as well as inform further research on the militarism-security nexus.",TRUE,FALSE,civil society militarism|Critical Security Studies|Exceptionalist militarism|Liberal Militarism|Martin Shaw|Michael Mann|Militarism|Nation-statist militarism|Security,2018-07-02T11:01:24.204115,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-21T12:59:52.450669,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Srdjan Vucetic,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/citation/,ezdqr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/desym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/relationships/node/,desym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594a6cc66c613b022873c568/,594a6cc66c613b022873c568,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ezdqr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ezdqr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ezdqr,NA
