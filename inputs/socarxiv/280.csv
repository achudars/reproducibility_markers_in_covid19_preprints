1.	Individuals act and interact in variable ways from constantly shifting states-of-affairs in pursuit of variable and inconsistent interests;
2.	Groups are made-up of individuals and their actions/interactions;
3.	The vast majority of groups, current and historic, are stable.
Together, the above statements comprise one of the central, perennial problems of sociology; given that the three statements above are empirically verifiable and thus objectively true, we live in stable societies made up of mutually inconsistent, constantly fluctuating individual actions. But how can this be? How can the patterned regularity of social life be aggregated from the disorder and seeming randomness of individual actions? When modeled, sampled, and plotted, the data set of statement 1 should have wide fluctuation in its mean; indeed, rational choice models have shown this to be the case. However the data set for statement 3 should not, yet because 3 is derived from 1 (via the axiom held at statement 2), we are confronted with the above problem.
The answer lies in what I call the Predictability Hypothesis, consisting of two clauses: A) of the possible paths to achieving her desired goals, an individual will choose the most predictable path towards the most predictable desired goal; if the individual cannot sufficiently predict the behavior or attributes of their interest or the path that constitutes pursuit of its achievement, she is very unlikely to choose to pursue the interest or to follow that path to the interest, and will instead choose a path and/or interest with a higher predictability; B) for comparable societies, those that provide more choice to their members simultaneously provide more predictability and will, ceteris paribus, be more stable than those that provide less choice and, thus, less predictability.
I contend that this hypothesis allows the resolution of the above difficulty: the analytical centrality of (neo-Bayesian) predictability to every choice no matter the context bridges the explanatory gap between individual actions and the large-scale sociological phenomena of social stability; in the same way, the analytical centrality of stability to groups and group structures allows us to identify the predictable paths of agency. This analytical dualism is used to identify the mutual morphogenesis of both sociodynamic ‘poles’ in the example...individual and collective, ‘micro’ and ‘macro’, agent and structure-culture, in a way applicable to a wide range of rigorous sociological inquiry.",TRUE,FALSE,Bounded Rationality|Contract Theory|Decision Theory|Entrained Choice|Morphogenesis|Rational Choice|Social Stability|Social Trust|Sociodynamics|Sociological Constant|Uncertainty,2019-12-08T01:28:46.614719,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T01:28:27.481973,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/citation/,hyjd8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5deaca2331d852000903a6f5/,5deaca2331d852000903a6f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hyjd8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hyjd8,NA

They also make clear that these companies are unlikely to disclose their practices and often go to great lengths to keep them hidden. At the same time, however, these companies are responsible for wide-reaching, influential phenomena that should be of core interest to scholars of information technology. While scholars’ methodologies and ethical conventions have tended to privilege the agency of research participants and focused on the prevention of harm, we argue that the current landscape calls for a reevaluation of these conventions. Specifically, we consider here what it would mean for researchers to take a more investigative approach by seeking to discover and reveal information that the subjects of the research would prefer to remain unknown.

A Novel Test of Ethnic Competition Theory,"Whether labor market competition is shaping anti-immigration attitudes is a contentious issue. We conduct a novel test of ethnic competition theory by comparing the attitudes towards immigration of workers with fixed-term contracts to those with permanent jobs in Europe. Fixed-term contract workers are particularly at risk of competition as they have to compete for jobs in the foreseeable future. In the first step of our investigation, we analyze cross-sectional data (ESS, 2002–18) from 18 Western European countries. We find that—contrary to our expectation—fixed-term workers are less anti-immigration. The effect is substantively small. In the second step, we use a fixed-effects design with longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP, 1999–2015) to rule out time-constant unobserved heterogeneity. We find that transitioning from a fixed- to a permanent contract does not affect anti-immigration attitudes. Our combined results thus add to the evidence against labor market competition as an explanation of anti-immigrant attitudes.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-08T01:24:26.323952,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T01:24:11.958364,NA,NA,available,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DY6N2,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/citation/,42xbp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dy6n2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/relationships/node/,dy6n2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dea930fa7db99000a51604d/,5dea930fa7db99000a51604d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42xbp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42xbp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42xbp,NA

The standard historiography of clinical trials, at least in Britain, is built around the trial of streptomycin as a treatment for tuberculosis organised by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) in the late 1940s. A series of clinical trials took place in Glasgow in the 1930s which doesn’t feature in the standard account. The reasons for their exclusion, and why they did take place, are the subject of this paper.

In recovering the context in which the Glasgow clinical trials took place three factors stand out. Firstly, the practice operated by the Glasgow Corporation of treating most cases of skin infection by hospitalising patients. Secondly, the high degree of interconnectivity between voluntary and state-funded hospitals in Glasgow at the time. Thirdly, the belief of Thomas Anderson in the value of biometry as a basis for evaluating therapies.

These factors can be given names. The first is the moral economy of medicine - the practice of establishing fever and isolation hospitals as part of hospital provision in Glasgow in the nineteenth century. The second is the political economy of medicine - the relationships among doctors, especially the degree of interconnectedness between the health systems associated with the University of Glasgow and the Corporation of Glasgow. The third is the mathematization of causality - in this case, the biometric sensibilities of Thomas Anderson: his understanding of, expertise, and belief in, the efficacy of quantification as a means of progress in scientific medicine.",TRUE,FALSE,Clinical Trials|Fever Hospitals|Glasgow|John Brownlee|Medical-Policing|Medical Research Council|Prontosil|Randomisation|Ruchill Hospital|Thomas Anderson|United Kingdom,2019-12-08T01:18:22.787471,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T01:18:09.178792,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/citation/,a9jzc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dea82bba7db99000c5181bb/,5dea82bba7db99000c5181bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a9jzc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a9jzc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a9jzc,NA

In spite of accusations of bias and invalidity, student evaluations of teaching have dominated teaching evaluation at U.S. universities. However, studies on the topic have tended to be limited to particular institutional and disciplinary contexts.  Moreover, in spite of the idealistic assumption that research and teaching are mutually beneficial, few studies have examined the link between research performance and student evaluations of teaching.  In this study, we conduct a large scale exploratory analysis of the factors associated with student evaluations of teachers, controlling for heterogeneous institutional and disciplinary contexts.  We source public student evaluations of teaching fromRateMyProfessor.comand information regarding career and contemporary research performance indicators from the companyAcademicAnalytics.  The factors most associated with higher student ratings were the attractiveness of the faculty and the student’s interest in the class; the factors most associated with lower student ratings were course difficulty and whether student comments mentioned an accent or a teaching assistant.

We interpret a failure to keep up with parental social class (i.e. downward mobility) as an indicator that individual’s status achievements lag behind expectations and contribute to subjective feelings of loss and decline. An innovative feature of this paper is that we investigate both whether individual’s mobility experience -- micro level -- and also whether opportunity structures -- mobility on a macro level -- are linked with attitudes towards immigration. In contexts with high downward-mobility, opportunities for moving up are limited and hence perceived economic decline and loss might lead to more hostility towards immigrants. By contrast, high upward mobility expands opportunities for all and as such might promote positive attitudes towards immigrants. We use the European Social Survey data (2002-10) and conduct analyses on 30 countries using diagonal reference models that allow the effects of individual mobility trajectory to be disentangled from origin status and destination status. Our results show that the working classes hold stronger anti-immigration attitudes and parental class continues to exert an effect on attitudes in adulthood even after accounting for individual’s own social class position. Being downwardly mobile from parental class does not appear to be associated with more hostility towards immigrants, except in a few European countries like Italy, Poland, and Greece. Our random-effects meta-regression models show, however, that people living in contexts of high downward mobility are more hostile towards immigrants compared to people in contexts with high upward mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-08T00:59:03.395912,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T00:58:44.290608,NA,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TPXBH,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/citation/,yxe7u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpxbh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/relationships/node/,tpxbh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dea53dceb3ee6000c8a6dbe/,5dea53dceb3ee6000c8a6dbe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yxe7u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yxe7u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yxe7u,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2020.100543
