Developing and delivering a vaccine may be the most likely way to end the pandemic. If it were possible to shorten this development time by weeks or months, this may have a significant effect on reducing deaths. Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials could take less long to conduct if they used human challenge methods – that is, deliberately infecting participants with COVID-19 following inoculation.

This article analyses arguments for and against such methods and provides suggested broad guidelines for regulators, researchers and ethics committees when considering these matters. It concludes that it may be possible to maintain current ethical standards yet still permit human challenge trials in a context where delay is critical.

The model involves necessarily infinity even in any finitely dimensional subspace of the complex Hilbert space being due to the complex basis. Furthermore, infinity is what unifies duality and opposition, universality and openness, completeness and incompleteness in it. The deduced core of quantum complementarity in terms of infinity, duality and opposition allows of resolving a series of various problems in different branches of philosophy: the common structure of incompleteness in Gödel’s (1931) theorems and Enstein, Podolsky, and Rosen’s argument (1935); infinity as both complete and incomplete; grounding and self-grounding, metaphor and representation between language and reality, choice and information, the totality and an observer, the basic idea of philosophical phenomenology.

Existing research posits an array of explanations: from economic strain to political mobilization and state capacity. This diversity of accounts is attributable to scholars’ tendency to lump together different forms of ethnic violence. Analyzing anti-Christian violence in Egypt, we identify three types of event – beatings, burnings, and bombings. This typology distinguishes between the target of the attack and the level of violence. Beatings (unarmed attacks targeting individuals) are more likely where Christians are numerous, during economic downturns, and are patterned by religious calendars. Burnings (unarmed attacks targeting property) follow a political logic, occurring where Islamists are mobilizing, and following crackdowns. Beatings and burnings are more prevalent where the state’s coercive capacity is diminished.

Its viewpoint suggests that the crucial link of time and its course is omitted in understanding the problem. The common interpretation underlain by the history of quantum mechanics sees discreteness only on the Plank scale, which is transformed into continuity and even smoothness on the macroscopic scale. That approach is fraught with a series of seeming paradoxes. It suggests that the present mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is only partly relevant to its problem, which is ostensibly known. The paper accepts just the opposite: The mathematical solution is absolute relevant and serves as an axiomatic base, from which the real and yet hidden problem is deduced. Wave-particle duality, Hilbert space, both probabilistic and many-worlds interpretations of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and the Schrödinger equation are included in that base.

The adequate generalization of ‘measurement’ is discussed to involve the discrepancy, due to the fundamental Planck constant, between any quantum coherent state and its statistical representation as a statistical ensemble after measurement. Quantum invariance designates the relation of any quantum coherent state to the corresponding statistical ensemble of measured results.
A set-theory corollary is the curious invariance to the axiom of choice: Any coherent state excludes any well-ordering and thus excludes also the axiom of choice. However the above equivalence requires it to be equated to a well-ordered set after measurement and thus requires the axiom of choice for it to be able to be obtained.
Quantum invariance underlies quantum information and reveals it as the relation of an unordered quantum “much” (i.e. a coherent state) and a well-ordered “many” of the measured results (i.e. a statistical ensemble). It opens up to a new horizon, in which all physical processes and phenomena can be interpreted as quantum computations realizing relevant operations and algorithms on quantum information. All phenomena of entanglement can be described in terms of the so defined quantum information. Quantum invariance elucidates the link between general relativity and quantum mechanics and thus, the problem of quantum gravity.
The nonlocality of quantum information unifies the exact position of any space-time point of a smooth trajectory and the common possibility of all space-time points due to a quantum leap. This is deduced from quantum invariance.
Epistemology involves the relation of ordering and thus a generalized kind of information, quantum one, to explain the special features of the cognition in quantum mechanics.,",TRUE,FALSE,axiom of choice|entanglement|quantum information|quantum invariance|qubit,2020-05-04T17:57:58.012825,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-04T16:24:44.653503,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/citation/,w6pd8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eafa57769d3e100a9df2bc3/,5eafa57769d3e100a9df2bc3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w6pd8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w6pd8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w6pd8

Using detailed case data from Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April, 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong’s high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom.

This shift raises the question as to whether medical research has given proper attention to the diseases imposing the greatest burden on society. Therefore, with the aim of identifying correlations between research funding priorities and public demand in health, we examine grants issued by the major medical research funding bodies of China and the UK during the decade 2006-2017 and compare the focus of their funded projects with the diseases that carry the highest burden of death, risk, or loss of health. The results indicate that the funding decisions of both nations do correspond to the illnesses with the highest health impact on their citizens. For both regions, the greatest health concerns surround non-communicable diseases, and neoplasms and cardiovascular disease in particular. In China, national health priorities have remained focused on these illnesses for the benefit of its own population, whereas the UK has funded a wider variety of research, extending to projects with impacts outside its borders to some developing countries. Additionally, despite an increased incidence of mental illness and HIV/AIDs in China, there is evidence that less priority has been given to these conditions. Both of these health areas seem to require more attention from China’s national funding agencies and the society in general.

Information symmetry and mechanical motion,"The concept of quantum information is introduced as both normed superposition of two orthogonal subspaces of the separable complex Hilbert space and invariance of Hamilton and Lagrange representation of any mechanical system. The base is the isomorphism of the standard introduction and the representation of a qubit to a 3D unit ball, in which two points are chosen.
The separable complex Hilbert space is considered as the free variable of quantum information and any point in it (a wave function describing a state of a quantum system) as its value as the bound variable.
A qubit is equivalent to the generalization of ‘bit’ from the set of two equally probable alternatives to an infinite set of alternatives. Then, that Hilbert space is considered as a generalization of Peano arithmetic where any unit is substituted by a qubit and thus the set of natural number is mappable within any qubit as the complex internal structure of the unit or a different state of it. Thus, any mathematical structure being reducible to set theory is representable as a set of wave functions and a subspace of the separable complex Hilbert space, and it can be identified as the category of all categories for any functor represents an operator transforming a set (or subspace) of the separable complex Hilbert space into another. Thus, category theory is isomorphic to the Hilbert-space representation of set theory &amp; Peano arithmetic as above.
Given any value of quantum information, i.e. a point in the separable complex Hilbert space, it always admits two equally acceptable interpretations: the one is physical, the other is mathematical. The former is a wave function as the exhausted description of a certain state of a certain quantum system. The latter chooses a certain mathematical structure among a certain category. Thus there is no way to be distinguished a mathematical structure from a physical state for both are described exhaustedly as a value of quantum information. This statement in turn can be utilized to be defined quantum information by the identity of any mathematical structure to a physical state, and also vice versa. Further, that definition is equivalent to both standard definition as the normed superposition and invariance of Hamilton and Lagrange interpretation of mechanical motion introduced in the beginning of the paper.
Then, the concept of information symmetry can be involved as the symmetry between three elements or two pairs of elements: Lagrange representation and each counterpart of the pair of Hamilton representation. The sense and meaning of information symmetry may be visualized by a single (quantum) bit and its interpretation as both (privileged) reference frame and the symmetries 𝑈𝑈(1), 𝑆𝑆𝑆 (2), and 𝑆𝑆𝑆 (3) of the Standard model.",TRUE,FALSE,|axiom of choice|axiom of (transfinite) induction|category theory|Hamilton representation|Hilbert space|information|Lagrange representation|Minkowski space|nformation symmetry|Peano arithmetic|pseudo-Riemannian space|quantum mechanics|qubit|set theory|special &amp; general relativity|Standard model,2020-05-04T15:05:16.092324,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-03T23:40:53.216965,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/citation/,etp5f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaf19320ffc0500b96f821c/,5eaf19320ffc0500b96f821c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etp5f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/etp5f/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/etp5f
