This paper investigates sanctions for scientific misconduct and their preceding investigation processes as visible and legitimate symbols. Using three different data sources (retraction notices, expert interviews, survey of scientists), we show that sanctions for scientific misconduct operate within a cycle of visibility, in which sanctions are highly visible, while investigation and decision-making procedures remain mostly invisible. This corresponds to high levels of acceptance for sanctions in the scientific community, but rather low acceptance of the respective authorities. Such a punitivity in turn exacerbates confidentiality concerns, so that authorities become even more secretive. We argue that punitivity towards scientific misconduct is driven by such a cycle of invisibility.",TRUE,FALSE,Punitivity|Sanctions|Scientific Misconduct|Sociology of Science|Visibility,2019-11-13T09:03:02.452178,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-13T09:02:43.906921,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/citation/,52xk9,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcac111ee9bb9000e5026e6/,5dcac111ee9bb9000e5026e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/52xk9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/52xk9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/52xk9,NA

The Long Reagan Coalition’s project to deconstruct the administrative state has reopened the door to sweeping bureaucratic experimentation by political entrepreneurs like Trump and his appointees.

Innovations in causal inference have shed new light on these effects. Here, we motivate the importance of innovation in the characterization of fecundity, and prenatal selection in particular. We argue that such innovation is crucial for expanding knowledge of the fetal origins of later life health. Pregnancy loss is common, responsive to environmental factors, and closely related to maternal and fetal health outcomes. As a result, selection into live birth is driven by many of the same exposures that shape the health trajectories of survivors. Lifecourse effects that are inferred without accounting for these dynamics may be significantly distorted by survival bias. We use a set of Monte Carlo simulations with realistic parameters to examine the implications of prenatal survival bias. We find that even in conservatively specified scenarios, true fetal origin effects can be underestimated by 50% or more. In contrast, effects of exposures that reduce the probability of prenatal survival but improve the health of survivors will be overestimated. The absolute magnitude of survival bias can even exceed small effect sizes, resulting in inferences that beneficial exposures are harmful or vice-versa. We also find reason for concern that moderately sized true effects, underestimated due to failure to account for selective survival, are missing from scientific knowledge because they do not clear statistical significance filters. This bias has potential real-world costs; policy decisions about interventions to improve maternal and infant health will be affected by underestimated program impact.",NA,NA,developmental origins of health and disease|fecundity|fetal origins|live birth bias|mortality selection|survival bias,NA,2019-12-04T21:18:42.836561,,TRUE,withdrawn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,"Hi Jenna, the figures are showing up fine for me, both in the viewer and when I download the paper.

In this way, both the development on ‘smart’ technology itself and its criticisms are the latest chapter in a long-standing disciplinary debate around quantification and technology. We re-evaluate this history and argue that quantitative methodology and its theoretical critiques are not as incompatible as often claimed.

To illustrate how we might address this apparent tension between theory and quantitative methods we review how both approaches conceptualize one of Geography’s core concepts: space, and highlight opportunities for symbiosis. Although smart technologies can further orthodox positivist approaches, we argue that the actual practice is more nuanced and not necessarily absolute or totalizing. For example, recent computational work builds upon critical geographic theories to analyze and visualize topological and relational spaces, relevant to topics such as gentrification and segregation. The result is not a Geography in which smart technology and algorithms remove the need for human input but rather a rejoinder in line with the recent resurgence of a critical quantitative geography. In short, a Geography where social theory and the human intellect play a key role in guiding computational approaches to analyze the largest, most versatile and relevant datasets on social space that we have ever had.",TRUE,FALSE,geocomputation|GIScience|smart technology|space|spatial science,2019-11-11T20:52:02.557514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11T20:51:34.945491,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/citation/,u2w6n,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc98288ee9bb9000d4ccc10/,5dc98288ee9bb9000d4ccc10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2w6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2w6n,https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1674630

Our argument is that these two forms of critique are systematically opposed to each other: They are based on opposing epistemic premises, they are motivated by opposing political concerns, and they pursue opposing visions of social progress. Scholars of International Relations (IR) who want to work with the conceptual tools of practice theory are thus confronted with a consequential choice. Understanding the alternatives can help them to be more self-reflexive in their research practices and intervene more forcefully in contemporary political debates. We illustrate these advantages through a discussion of the scholarly debate on the practices of multilateral diplomacy through which the United Nations Security Council authorized a military intervention in Libya in 2011.",TRUE,FALSE,critical theory|critique|diplomacy|humanitarian intervention|international practices|Libya|practice theory|practice turn|pragmatism|United Nations Security Council,2019-11-11T20:50:04.188375,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11T20:49:44.496933,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/citation/,96pbm,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc97f3b8f0e5e000bd1af1b/,5dc97f3b8f0e5e000bd1af1b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96pbm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/96pbm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/96pbm,https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqz057

Examined phenomena include, for example, variation in past human population levels and climate-change-driven sea level fluctuations. These processes are thought to have affected the amount of organic carbon deposited into the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record at a given time. Time-series representing through-time fluctuations in the frequency of dated radiocarbon samples are, therefore, often used as proxies for such processes. However, there are important problems with radiocarbon-date proxies that have so far gone underappreciated in the scientific literature. The primary problem is that the proxies are easily misinterpreted, and this has serious implications for downstream analyses. Here we report the results of a two-part study. In the first part, we investigated the most accurate interpretation of radiocarbon-date proxies produced with each of the two established methods, widely-used summed probability density functions and a new kernel density estimation approach. In the second part, we performed a simulated regression experiment to determine whether the proxies could be used to quantitatively investigate the processes they are often thought to represent. Our analyses unfortunately reveal that the proxies do not reflect what they are generally thought to---i.e., through-time variation in processes correlated with radiocarbon sample frequency. Rather, they represent a combination of through-time variation in sample frequency and chronological uncertainty. More importantly, though, our regression experiment demonstrated that the proxies can produce very misleading results. While the proxies may be useful under certain conditions for addressing certain kinds of research questions, they are not generally suitable as representations of through-time processes. A major implication of this finding is that a significant number of high-profile published studies may be reporting false results based on misinterpretations of core data. Another major implication is that the proxies should be avoided in future research when the goal is to understand through-time variation in a given process.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeological and Palaeoenvironmental Data Science|Archaeology|Bayesian Regression|Palaeoenvironmental Science|Radiocarbon Date Proxies|Simulation|SPDF|Summed Probability Density Functions|Summed Radiocarbon Date Densities,2019-11-11T20:48:21.599206,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11T20:47:59.611851,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/citation/,yp38j,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v93zu/,v93zu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc9756c7f37e3000dccef95/,5dc9756c7f37e3000dccef95,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yp38j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yp38j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yp38j,NA
