The results are as follows: During the early Ratanakosin period, only one piece of Thai poetry recording the lives of two Hindu Indians fighting over a Melayu woman was written using a Thai setting. In the Middle Ratanakosin period, one renowned book about India recounted the visit of a young King Rama V of Siam to India to experience and learn from the positive and negative experience of colonized countries. His Majesty was inspired by that visit and reformed Siam (former name of Thailand) into a dynastic state with numerous new economic political and social developments. In the current Ratanakosin period of rampant globalization, “Indianness” presented in the settings and protagonists are plotted in many Thai novels mixing with “Thainess” through Thai or Indian-Thai characterisation and aspects of culture and concepts related to Hinduism and Buddhism. “Dharma” and “Karma” are the main key reflections found in Thai works.

In legal translation which is a special and specialized area of translational activity (Cao, 2007), and where documents are characterized by brevity, economy, and neatness to prevent fraud, additions, omissions or alterations in the text (Crystal &amp; Davy, 1969), mistakes or mistranslations can lead to disastrous repercussions. The present study deals primarily with the methods that translators of legal texts follow and adopt when rendering a legal document. A concise account of translation theories that have been adopted and are still being applied to legal translation is offered to attempt to show the main views towards the application of such translation theories to legal translation. Major methods often used in the translation of legal documents are then presented, discussing their validity to legal translation. This presentation includes literal translation, free translation, the functional approach to translation, transliteration &amp; transcription, loan translation, adaptation, description by definitions, lexical expansion, and descriptive substitution.

These concepts are REWARD, HUMILITY, HYPOCRISY, and ARROGANCE, which recur in many positions in the Qur’an. The researcher takes up selected Qur’anic verses that carry these abstract concepts and analyzes them at two levels: linguistic and conceptual. The study’s main theoretical contribution is to show how a linguistic approach can be transformed into a conceptual one and how this enriches our understanding of abstraction. The linguistic analysis of the verses is supported by translations of Qur’anic meanings, interpretation of the verses, and cultivating the use of Arabic and English dictionaries. To perform the cognitive analysis, the researcher uses Lakoff and Johnson’s Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), which examines metaphor from two domains: the target domain, which is the abstract concept to be explained and the source domain, which is the mental mapping that helps us understand that abstract concept. The study finds that metaphors in the Qur’an are meant to be understood not only linguistically but conceptually too. It concludes by emphasizing the significance of a conceptual approach to the study of metaphor in the Qur’an not only for conceptual metaphor theory but also for the interpretation of the Qur’an and for Arabic linguistics.",TRUE,FALSE,abstract concept|cognitive|conceptual metaphor|linguistic metaphor|Qur’an|source domain|target domain,2019-06-04T11:29:44.560644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:10:37.028496,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/citation/,42gkd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5ed12d987b5001689718c/,5cf5ed12d987b5001689718c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42gkd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42gkd

As English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students, English fiction is one of a good source to improve students ability in using English. By reading more fictions, EFL students can gain many benefits directly or indirectly to their English, and it can be seen easily from their fluency by using a special model named Poster Presentation. Furthermore, poster presentation can be used in teaching and learning as variations in reading activity. This research is to explore the use of fiction stories and Poster Presentations for Indonesian EFL students at Lambung Mangkurat University. There were some stages during the Fiction stories and poster presentation project which involved tutoring, group work, and the poster presentation. The students were asked to read short fiction stories, make a summary of it, and finally design the summary into posters. The tutoring part was beneficial to keep students understand the project.

Forster’s A Passage to India (1924) and Louis Bertrand’s La Cina (1901),"The main focus of this research paper is to study one of the key concepts of postcolonial critical theory which is “Identity and Representation”. It is based upon a textual reading and analysis of two texts as representatives of colonial literature written about British-India and French-Algeria, namely A Passage to India by E.M. Forster and La Cina by Louis Bertrand. Relying on Albert Memmi’s foundational postcolonial theory developed in his The Colonizer and the Colonized, we assume that both texts obey and reflect a similar ideological discourse. The narratives are revealed to operate through a complex system which tends to (re)fashion and to (re)mold the identity of both the colonizer and the colonized. We demonstrate that Forster and Bertrand shape the main characters into two types which Memmi labels as: ‘the Colonizer who Accepts’ and ‘the Colonizer who Refuses’. We have also showed that the writers though belonging to different imperial powers and writing in two different languages, they could not but adhere and support the colonial practices of their countries.  What comes also of this study is that Forster, though most often known for his Liberalism, vehicles a racial discourse which accounts for the superiority of the British colonizer. Bertrand is much more racist and jingoist, his attitudes are reminders of what Achebe said about Conrad; ‘a bloody racist’.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-04T11:30:50.198906,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:11:27.184012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/citation/,x692h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5e9994df3460019bda290/,5cf5e9994df3460019bda290,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x692h/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x692h

Many critics have commented on the plot and background of the novel. The main aim  of this study is to reveal various instances projecting kindness and sympathy in between the social conflict and social tension at the background of the novel “Great Expectation. The study will focus on the concept of kindness towards others which has been incorporated throughout the story of the novel between the narrator and the characters. Charles Dickens (1812- 1870) has shed light upon the theme of social mobility, manners, social injustice and prospect towards tangible reality. This study answers the question whether Dickens could be able to reflect the concept of kindness in the novel or not? Moreover, it will search whether the concept of kindness has been explored well in the story of the novel that it contains probable educational contents of kindness for research. To prove that, the article will explore various aspects of kindness, which has been observed during the course of the novel. The study would be based on qualitative research method from secondary resources. The aspect of kindness would be analyzed and highlighted through multiple scenes from the novel. The study would be concluded on the point where Dickens stresses on the dialect for up gradation of social status in Pip in order to establish himself as a desired partner of Estella despite having a social difference of class during the Victorian period.",TRUE,FALSE,Charles Dickens|dialect|expectations|kindness|mobility|social injustice|social tension,2019-06-04T11:31:29.592202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:11:40.527513,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/citation/,bh4y2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5e8b1b700fa001d9f7ab4/,5cf5e8b1b700fa001d9f7ab4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh4y2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bh4y2/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bh4y2

It argues that the tragic resolution brought to the theme of social protest and the characterization of the protagonist is what gives the play its unique place as the quintessential modern tragedy. It is concluded that tragedy and the social theme are not mutually destructive in Death of a Salesman as some critics stated. Rather, they are combined to make an intense dramatic treatment of the modern American individual’s most pressing issues. Without being constrained by prescriptive standardized rules, Miller produced a dramatic form that rightly claims the status of what can be labeled a modern tragedy, appealing to modern audiences as rarely any other modern play did.",TRUE,FALSE,Arthur Miller|catharsis|dramatic structure|social drama|tragedy.,2019-06-04T11:31:29.449021,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:12:02.464270,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/citation/,a5mnx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5e7c5d987b50016896e02/,5cf5e7c5d987b50016896e02,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5mnx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a5mnx/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a5mnx
