In a period of hyper-competition for resources, with perverse incentives that lead to academic capitalism and a “publish or perish” mentality, the lack of robust and cumulative research on approaches, models and practices of peer review can slow down efforts towards fostering research integrity and the credibility of scholarly communication. A major challenge in studying peer review systematically is the lack of available data. While data sharing in scientific research has made relevant progress in certain fields, the lack of infrastructures to promote the sharing of peer review data among publishers, journals and academic scholars, the challenges posed by privacy and data protection legislation, and the perceived lack of incentives for publishers, learned societies and journals to share data, have all hampered efforts in this important domain. While public authorities, learned societies and publishers may face different priorities, incentives and obstacles regarding data sharing, the time has come to call to action all stakeholders who play a part in this field. In this paper, we argue that an infrastructure for data sharing is needed to stimulate independent, collaborative, public research on peer review and we suggest measures and initiatives to set up a collaborative effort towards this goal.",TRUE,FALSE,Data sharing|Infrastructure|Journals|Peer Review|Scholarly communication,2019-11-05T12:42:41.706654,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-05T12:42:06.533837,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/citation/,sr6eg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc15077e18a3c000ac58aaf/,5dc15077e18a3c000ac58aaf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sr6eg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sr6eg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sr6eg

The lack of established measurement tools in the study of menstrual health and hygiene has been identified as a significant limitation of quantitative studies to date. However, there has been limited exploration of existing measurement to identify avenues for improvement. 
Methods. We undertook two linked systematic reviews of (1) trials of menstrual health interventions and their nested studies in low- and middle-income countries, (2) studies developing or validating measures of menstrual experiences from any location. Systematic searching was undertaken in 12 databases, together with handsearching. We iteratively grouped and audited concepts measured across included studies and extracted and compared measures of each concept.
Results. A total of 23 trials, 9 nested studies and 22 measure development studies were included. Trials measured a range of outcomes including menstrual knowledge, attitudes, and practices, school absenteeism, and health. Most measure validation studies focused on assessing attitudes towards menstruation, while a group of five studies assessed the accuracy of women’s recall of their menstrual characteristics such as timing and cycle length. Measures of menstrual knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and restrictions were inconsistent and frequently overlapped. No two studies measured the same menstrual or hygiene practices, with 44 different practices assessed. This audit provides a summary of current measures and extant efforts to pilot or test their performance. 
Conclusions. Inconsistencies in both the definition and operationalisation of concepts measured in menstrual health and hygiene research should be addressed. To improve measurement, authors should clearly define the constructs they aim to measure and outline how these were operationalised for measurement. Results of this audit indicate the need for the development and validation of new measures, and the evaluation of the performance of existing measures across contexts. In particular, the definition and measurement of menstrual practices, knowledge, attitudes, norms and restrictions should be addressed.

Testing the application of fan charts in monitoring national homicide trends over time,"Purpose: The goal of this study is to compare the increase in the 2015 national homicide rate to the historical data series and other violent crime rate changes.  
Methods: We use ARIMA models and a one-step ahead forecasting technique to predict national homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault rates in the United States. Annual Uniform Crime Report data published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are used in our analysis. 
Results: The 2015 homicide rate increased above the 90% prediction interval for our model, but not more conservative intervals. Predictions intervals for other national level crime rates consistently produced correct coverage using our forecasting approach.
Conclusions: Our findings provide weak evidence that the national homicide rate spiked in 2015, though data for 2016 – 2018 do not show a continued anomalous increase in the U.S. homicide rate.

This paper uses complete death certificate data from the Mortality Multiple Cause Files with American Community Survey data to examine age-specific mortality rates for married and non-married people from 2007 to 2017. The overall rise in White mortality is limited almost exclusively to those who are not married, for men and women. By comparison, mortality for Blacks and Hispanics has fallen or remained flat regardless of marital status (except for young, single Hispanic men). Analysis by education level shows death rates have risen most for Whites with the lowest education, but have also increased for those with high school or some college. Because mortality has risen faster for unmarried Whites at all but the lowest education levels, there has been an increase in the marriage mortality ratio.

Research on student loans has focused on quantitative estimation of the effects of borrowing on educational attainment, economic well-being, health, and life course milestones. Drawing on sixty interviews with respondents working as lawyers in the northeastern U.S., we argue that student loans also have underappreciated relational effects, even for relatively privileged borrowers. Relational work around student loans is particularly visible during three important moments: the decision to borrow, the decision to partner, and when planning children’s futures. While scholars have examined the effects of borrowing on marriage and childbearing decisions, they have implicitly assumed that it is difficulty repaying that causes such effects.

A psychologically taxing job, a handful of scholars and journalists have studied the emotional burden for content moderators in the West, many of whom are predominantly based in Silicon Valley. However, much of this work is increasingly outsourced to the Global South, namely in India and the Philippines. Despite the fact that these overseas moderators filter UGC from Western countries, where the cultural norms on topics like hate speech and sexuality differ from those in Eastern countries like India, the academic research to date has neglected to study foreign content moderators and the ways in which their culture may impact their decision-making processes in reviewing UGC. This thesis takes a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews to study content moderators in India with the objective of understanding not only the country’s booming and rapidly-evolving content moderation industry, but more essentially the subjectivities of Indian moderators and how their culture might influence their work. In addition to presenting novel findings in the general field of CCM, this research ultimately demonstrates that many of the assumptions about Indian content moderators – primarily that they are unable to separate their own cultural upbringings from the US-centric policy guidelines they are meant to uphold – are erroneous and in need of revisiting.",TRUE,FALSE,Commercial content moderation|Content moderation|Internet|Internet policy|Platform governance,2019-11-01T19:38:42.455857,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-01T19:38:20.863375,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/citation/,hjcv2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbc724bf3bb87000c8a5a18/,5dbc724bf3bb87000c8a5a18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hjcv2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hjcv2

Previous qualitative testing of questionnaire instruments that include questions about antibiotics or drug-resistant infections has suggested that questions on this topic are subject to measurement error for multiple reasons. This study used 13 cognitive interviews with pet owners to identify issues with a questionnaire instrument for a survey examining pet owners’ knowledge and behaviour around antibiotic use both personally and regarding their pets. Key findings from the study are that there are notable differences in quality of recollection between personal and pet-focused antibiotic use, and that socially desirable responding is only applied to certain behaviour questions. This article argues that cognitive interviews can provide substantial benefits as part of mixed-methods social research by supplementing dimension-reduced survey questionnaires with participants’ explanations, narratives, and experiences relating to the survey questions, with further benefits for qualitative theme generation.",TRUE,FALSE,Antibiotic Resistance|Antibiotic Use|Antimicrobial Resistance|Cognitive Interview|Companion Animals|Pet Owners|Social Science|Survey Research,2019-11-01T19:39:42.126464,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-01T19:39:29.952151,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/citation/,zyq2t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hm24q/,hm24q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbc5bdfbc32f4000f158a2c/,5dbc5bdfbc32f4000f158a2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyq2t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zyq2t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zyq2t

Previous research has found a negative association between network size and age, suggesting that people experience greater isolation from their personal networks with advancing age. In this paper, we evaluate age differences in how individuals perceive their social worlds to be structured, rather than focusing solely on network size.

Research Design &amp; Methods
A nationally represented sample of respondents (n=1,824) reported on their own ties to their close personal network members (i.e., ego-alter ties) as well as their perceptions of the acquaintanceship between those members (i.e., alter-alter ties). We used social network analysis to assess how the structure of these relationships vary by respondent age.

Results
There is a strong pattern of age-homophily with some inter-generational contact for both ego-to-alter and alter-to-alter ties. Egos perceive less age-heterophily among their alters than they perceive in their own ties. Net of the results for age-mixing, we find a positive association between ego age and personal network size and a negative association between average alter age and personal network size. Finally, we find that as alters’ ages increase, their expected degrees as perceived by ego decreases regardless of ego’s own age. 

Discussion &amp; Implication
Our results suggest that our social worlds shift in terms of size and structure across the life course. While contemporary close personal networks may grow slightly with age, our perceptions of older people having fewer network ties remains. We discuss these results in the context of recent findings that suggest aging uniformly insulates individuals from social contact from both structural and symbolic perspectives. Specifically, the findings here challenge the notion that network size declines with age suggesting that this result may be the product of perceptions and not reality.",TRUE,FALSE,aging|gerontology|social networks,2019-10-31T19:43:42.853967,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-31T19:23:31.335604,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/citation/,tfesn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eaxmj/,eaxmj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbb2680af84c3000ce6aeb7/,5dbb2680af84c3000ce6aeb7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tfesn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tfesn
