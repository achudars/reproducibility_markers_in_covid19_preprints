Such discussion relates to a debate about the production mode 1, in which basic knowledge is produced irrespective of industry-oriented applications, and the production mode 2, in which knowledge is produced in the context of industry-oriented applications.
In the literature review, a discussion on the New Legal Landmark for ST&amp;I and the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation (NSSTI) relates these themes to the Triple Helix Approach – interaction among university, industry and government. In addition, a discussion on the typologies of academic entrepreneurship and the concept of academic hybridity was carried out, by means of the analysis of how such configurations influence how scholars view the ways of producing, diffusing and commercializing knowledge. This study consists of a qualitative research, of an exploratory character, which is oriented by phenomenology and hermeneutics, and applies the snowball sampling technique for recruiting the interviewees. The subjects of this research consisted of 15 scholars from two public universities of the state of Rio de Janeiro, who somehow perform or have tried to perform academic entrepreneurship activities and/or self-identify as entrepreneurs, according to their cognitive representations of the phenomenon. Such individuals have been named hybrid life individuals. We opted for carrying out in-depth conversational semi-structured interviews as a data collection technique. The research was guided by the following guiding question: how do the hybrid life individuals relate to the new paradigms, tendencies and regulations that promote a greater interaction among university, industry and government at the Brazilian public universities? This central question was supported by three accessory questions: a) how do the so-called hybrid life individuals perceive of and describe their experiences as academic entrepreneurs?; b) what are the barriers that impede the interaction university-industry-government from the perspective of the hybrid life individual?; c) how do the so-called hybrid life individuals view the influence of the New Legal Landmark for Science, Technology and Innovation in their activities? In the analysis and discussion of the research results, we demonstrated the path taken by the interviewees in search for answers. The most relevant conclusions of this research provide some possible clues regarding the multiple and plural ways in the process of production, diffusion and commercialization of knowledge. These clues also point that, despite the advances, there are still barriers for the interaction among university, industry and government. It was also observed that the possibilities for implementing and operationalizing the New Legal Landmark will depend on the adherence by the legal operators and academic scientists to the new regulations.",TRUE,FALSE,academic entrepreneurship|academic hybridity|entrepreneur university|Triple Helix approach,2019-05-31T09:34:51.280752,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-31T09:34:14.434569,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,No,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/citation/,g6ukw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced79af2a50c4001980be6e/,5ced79af2a50c4001980be6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ukw/,https://doi.org/10.22409/PPGAd.2019.m.01656969742,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ukw

Existing research examines why active people “avoid” activist identities but has less to say about how active people adopt such identities as if they automatically follow participation. We draw on interviews with high school and college students from a midsize southwestern city to examine how young people make sense of what it means to be an activist, who identifies as such, and why youth are willing—or unwilling—to adopt this label. We find that respondents’ conceptualizations of “activists” are critical to (non)identification. Those who see activism as a broad category are more likely to identify, holding constant their level of activity. Those who see activism as a greedy institution, requiring significant substantive fluency, making the issue their primary focus, and willingness to sacrifice, do not, despite their level of engagement.

I argue that the political processes in Taiwan, as well as the outcomes of the local elections in 2018, reflect not the reversal of the liberal democratic ideals in the country but of the support of ‘underdogs’ and ‘黨外’, as well as the longstanding tradition of anti-establishment political affiliations among Taiwanese people. Using the 1992-2015 Taiwan Social Change Survey, I test the effects of demographic characteristics and of national identity (net of ethnic identity) on the anti-establishment political sentiments vis-à-vis the support of the mainstream political parties. I find that people with dual identity were at the core of the anti-establishment movement in the 90s and 00s. Moreover, they were more likely to be younger, well educated, and have higher earnings. The democratic process with periodic changes in power since the lift of the martial law was, therefore, driven by the electorate who used to identify themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese in the early years of the democratic rule in Taiwan.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-establishment sentiments|national identity|political affiliation|tang-wai,2019-05-28T21:23:07.407679,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-28T21:22:53.026586,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/citation/,zfeac,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced454135f2580016b0e3f6/,5ced454135f2580016b0e3f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zfeac/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zfeac/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zfeac

Yet it is among the least researched topics in police science. Other types of investigations are performed using the same overall methodology, but within different jurisdictions and with different objectives. Experience suggests that there is room for trans-organisational and inter-subject learning between various organisations performing investigations, and the miscellaneous fields of investigation and forensics. This document describes a preliminary investigation process model designed to be applicable in all situations where a systematic examination or study is performed. The model is based on previous work by contemporary scholars and shares similarities with Fahsing’s ”6 Cs” circular model. Descriptive Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) is used to visualise the process.

ICT with children. However, as they are found to have had no or only a little training or practical 
experience of pedagogical use of ICT, it is important to explore where the positive attitude comes 
from, and what pedagogical benefits early childhood educators believe ICT use brings about. This 
study focuses on the relationships of educators’ general and ICT-related pedagogical beliefs, and the 
foundations of educators’ positive ICT pedagogical beliefs.   
In their general pedagogical beliefs, the educators emphasized the learning of socio-emotional skills, 
and reported that they carry out practices where children have an active role in their learning. In their 
ICT pedagogical beliefs, the educators emphasized the learning of academic skills, and the methods 
they described were usually individual exercises which were either carried out using ICT or by 
following educators’ ICT-supported instructions. Positive ICT pedagogical beliefs were, to a large

time and place intersect in it and how places become one of the concrete
media through which the Mengen relate to each other . I start by focusing on how the Mengen organise their horticulture in time by following the cycles of particular trees thus dividing the year into several seasons during which different gardening tasks are done. This is a concrete example of the temporality of the Mengen landscape. It shows how ecological temporalities, such as the growth of certain trees and food plants, intersect or converge with human temporal trajectories. Following that, I show how people not only coordinate their activities by observing a temporal landscape, but through their gardening activities they also create it. Places created in the course of people’s lives are important historical markers and indices of people’s relations with each other and the land.",TRUE,FALSE,anthropology|environment|history|landscape|logging|place|politics|space and place|swidden horticulture|temporality|time,2019-05-28T14:22:21.848844,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-28T14:21:49.837632,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/citation/,3sf96,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cecf0012a50c40019805a61/,5cecf0012a50c40019805a61,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3sf96/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3sf96/,https://doi.org/10.21435/sfa.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3sf96

In this project, we wanted to assign OA tags to publications in KB database. We queried KB in-house database up to 2017 (including Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus) for all articles and reviews. We then matched the corresponding DOIs to three sources of OA information: Unpaywall, Crossref and Bielefeld list of gold OA journals. This allowed us to define the OA status for publications. We found close to 14 million publications (articles and reviews between 2000 and 2016) from WOS (69.75% of all) and close to 18 million from Scopus (68.67% of all) with an equivalent DOI in Unpaywall. We matched KB publications database with Crossref data (from April 2018) and found 53 distinct licence URLs, which define in many cases the legally binding access status of publications. We found that more than half a million publications have more than one licence record in Crossref (in contrast to near 8 million with only one record and more than 6 million without a licence URL). We evaluated if these licences were open or closed access. We also matched respective journal ISSNs with DOAJ and ROAD databases and presented a categorization of publications to Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and Delayed OA accounting for uncertainty due to missing licence information via a new sub-category Probable Hybrid OA. We validate our findings via manual checks and a crosscheck of OA information from the aforementioned varying sources. While the manual check on a sample of publications revealed a small but noticeable degree of apparently incorrect meta-information on publication’s OA status, the contrast of OA information from the diverse OA information sources highlights the partially unsteady base for an OA monitoring based on open data.",TRUE,FALSE,Crossref|DZHW|Hidden Gold OA|Hybrid OA|Open Access|Scopus|Unpaywall|WOS,2019-05-27T14:08:01.317161,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-27T14:07:44.939761,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/citation/,sdzft,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cebaced35f2580017aad11f/,5cebaced35f2580017aad11f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdzft/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sdzft/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sdzft
