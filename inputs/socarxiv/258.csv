The study adopts a qualitative technique of semi-structured interviews to elicit the views of 12 purposively chosen participants. The process of a thematic analysis of the qualitative data led to the emergence of three overarching themes that aimed to answer the main research question which is how the dental students in the Saudi context perceive the ESP materials and the impact these materials have on their language proficiency. The key findings indicate that the ESP learners in the dentistry department have a very positive attitude towards learning the English language in general and ESP in particular. Their awareness of their linguistic needs makes it a significant study in the field of ESP in Saudi Arabia. The results also suggest that the coursebook contents and material are outdated and inappropriate for the ESP learners in the Saudi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. The findings illustrate that the ESP teachers need to use the English language in classrooms and introduce learner-centred interactive activities to encourage students to participate in classroom activities.

Carlos Relvas's stereoscopic photography: the digital reunion of negatives and prints,"The beginning the photographic activity of Carlos Relvas (1838-1894) is closely connected to stereoscopic photography. This fact has not always been quite clear since Carlos Relvas’s stereoviews have remained one of the least known sides of his photographic work. The dispersion of his stereo cards among several public and private collections, as well as the long period of inaccessibility to his archive of negatives, hindered the perception of the meaningful work that Carlos Relvas carried out in the production of stereoscopic views of Portugal. One of the main challenges of the 21st-century studies of photography lies in the opportunity to publish online images from early photography collections. Digital media can enhance these collections and expand their reading. Among the main beneficiaries will be photographic negatives, which will gain new heuristic importance in this new environment of mediations. That was our intuition by developing a digital catalogue for the collections of Carlos Relvas’s stereoscopic photography aiming to bring together and combine all his negatives and positives and thus, for the first time, allow a comprehensive image of his passion for this type of photography.",TRUE,FALSE,Carlos Relvas|Catalogue Raisonné|Collodion-on-glass negative|Portuguese Nineteenth Century Photography|Stereoscopic Photography,2020-02-01T03:20:01.600140,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T03:19:30.652519,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76caa|Arts and Humanities|Photography,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/citation/,6qdj3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e34a66a57427b00620c301c/,5e34a66a57427b00620c301c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qdj3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qdj3

Our objective is to utilise metaphor to instigate critical reflection about the nature of social media use behaviour and the role of habitual social media use in our experiences of reality. The first metaphor, social media as a town square, draws attention to the centrality of social media platforms in their users’ lives, fear of missing out, augmented reality and digital dualism. Through the second metaphor, social media as a beauty pageant, we explore self-presentation or image crafting, social comparison and self-evaluation. The third metaphor, social media as a parliament, emphasises the role of social media platforms as spaces for online deliberation and we consider social media capital, homophily and polarisation as themes. Finally, we explore anonymity, deindividuation and deceptive self-presentation through our fourth metaphor, social media as a masquerade ball. We argue that social media scholars can use these and other metaphors to enhance communication of their research findings. Additionally, we believe that social media metaphors can be powerful pedagogical and communication tools, particularly when working with students for whom high levels of social media use is the norm.",TRUE,FALSE,Beauty pageant|masquerade ball|Metaphor|parliament|Social Media|Town Square,2020-02-01T03:18:42.470718,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T03:18:19.532315,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/citation/,58bvj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e340dd7f6631d012c5a320a/,5e340dd7f6631d012c5a320a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58bvj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58bvj

The method has been implemented for Stata in the popular oaxaca program for cross-sectional analyses.  In the last decades, however, research questions have been more often focused on the decomposition of group-based differences in change over time, e.g. diverging income trajectories, as well as decomposition of change in differences between groups, e.g. change in the gender pay gap over time.  We review five existing methods for the decomposition of changes in group means and contribute a complementing interventionist perspective, which is suitable for applications with a clear before-after comparison.
        These decompositions of levels and changes over time can be implemented using a first version of the program {\tt xtoaxaca}, which works as a postestimation command for different regression commands in Stata.

We introduce a new criterion based on two constraints, accounting for both ecological and human sustainability. The ecological constraint is defined trough   a novel indicator, the eco-balance, grounded on the well known concept of ecological footprint and the new concept of population biodensity. The human sustainability constraint is based on the minimum per capita consumption of natural capital needed to achieve a sufficient level of human well-being. ´ The application of our criterion to world countries shows where technological improvements and changes in consumption patterns are sufficient to reach sustainability, and where actions on population and  restoring ecological capital are also needed. This highlights complex patterns going beyond simplistic   schemes, such as overconsumption vs. overpopulation or developed vs. developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-31T08:32:42.084760,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-31T08:32:29.971916,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/citation/,axkb5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e32f505f6631d008e5a4d3f/,5e32f505f6631d008e5a4d3f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axkb5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/axkb5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/axkb5

Shifts in the distributions of temperature and precipitation may increase the volatility of farmers' yields, leading to rising but insurable risk, and/or reduce mean yields and thus cause permanent reductions in the returns to farming.  We use a multi-run climate model to predict the future distribution of yields at the district level for sixteen major crops.  For the average district, we project a sharp decline in mean agricultural revenue, but relatively small shifts in volatility.  This is because weather draws resulting in extremely low agricultural revenue -- what had once been 1-in-100-year events -- are predicted to become the norm by the end of the century, implying substantial uninsurable losses from the changing climate.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|CESM-LENS|climate change|crop yield|economics|extreme events|India|yield volatility,2020-01-31T08:33:42.978176,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-31T08:33:29.752474,FALSE,NA,no,ICRISAT Village Dynamics in South Asia (VDSA).
