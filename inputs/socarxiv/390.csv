One of the most recent strategies that exploit social
contacts for the purpose of marketing, is referral marketing, where a person shares information related to a particular product
among his/her social contacts. When this spreading of marketing information goes viral, the diffusion process looks like an
epidemic spread. In this work, we perform a systematic study with a goal to device a methodology for using the huge amount of
survey data available to understand customer behaviour from a more mathematical and quantitative perspective. We perform
an unsupervised natural language processing based analysis of the responses of a recent survey focusing on referral marketing
to correlate the customers’ psychology with transitional dynamics, and investigate some major determinants that regulate the
diffusion of a campaign. In addition to natural language processing for topic modeling, detailed differential equation based
analysis and graph theoretical treatment, experiments have been performed for generation of a recommendation network to
understand the diffusion dynamics in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous population. A complete mathematical treatment
with analysis over real social networks can help us to determine key customer motivations and their impacts on a marketing
strategy, which are important to ensure an effective spread of a designed marketing campaign. Pointing out possibilities of
extending these studies to game theoretic modeling, we prescribe a new quantitative framework that can find its application to
all areas of social dynamics, beyond the field of marketing.",TRUE,FALSE,Bifurcation|Digital epidemiology|Graph theory|Human behavior modeling|Nonlinear Dynamics|Referral marketing|Social networks|Tipping point,2019-09-12T14:38:49.273436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12T14:38:30.823386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",Sayantari Ghosh,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/citation/,6spnr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a04f4fcbf44001a445b4d/,5d7a04f4fcbf44001a445b4d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6spnr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6spnr,NA

Leveraging advantages of digital publishing, megajournals are characterized by large publication volume, broad interdisciplinary scope, and peer review filters that select primarily on scientific soundness as opposed to novelty or originality. These publishing innovations are complementary and/or competitive vis-à-vis traditional journals. We analyze how megajournals (PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports) are represented in different fields relative to prominent generalist journals (Nature, PNAS, Science) and ‘quasi-megajournals’ (Nature Communications, PeerJ). Our results show that both megajournals and prominent traditional journals have distinctive niches, despite the similar interdisciplinary scopes of such journals. These niches – defined by publishing volume and disciplinary diversity – are dynamic and varied over the relatively brief histories of the analyzed megajournals. Although the life sciences are the predominant contributor to megajournals, there is variation in the disciplinary composition of different megajournals.

These descriptions reflect two major theories purporting to account for the relative absence of armed conflict during this period: one emphasising the pacifying impact of the EU, and the other emphasising the pacifying impact of the US/NATO. The present paper attempts to evaluate these theories by comparing the role of the EU and the US/NATO in several domains of armed conflict in Europe. It focuses on the mechanisms through which the two organisations have affected the risk and scale of armed conflict within each domain. Although both the EU and the US/NATO have contributed to the relative peace in Europe since the end of the Second World War, there is at least one domain in which each of the organisations has either exacerbated or failed to prevent armed conflict.

Sociologists routinely partition samples into subgroups to explore how the effects of treatments vary by covariates like race, gender, and socioeconomic status. In so doing, analysts determine the key subpopulations based on theoretical priors. Data-driven discoveries are also routine, yet the analyses by which sociologists typically go about them are problematic and seldom move us beyond our expectations, and biases, to explore new meaningful subgroups. Emerging machine learning methods allow researchers to explore sources of variation that they may not have previously considered, or envisaged. In this paper, we use causal trees to recursively partition the sample and uncover sources of treatment effect heterogeneity. We use honest estimation, splitting the sample into a training sample to grow the tree and an estimation sample to estimate leaf-specific effects. Assessing a central topic in the social inequality literature, college effects on wages, we compare what we learn from conventional approaches for exploring variation in effects to causal trees. Given our use of observational data, we use leaf-specific matching and sensitivity analyses to address confounding and offer interpretations of effects based on observed and unobserved heterogeneity.

Progress in data science and inverse-design of materials give reason for optimism that advances can be made if appropriate data resources are made available. Data stewardship also plays a critical role in maintaining broad support for research in the face of well-publicized replication failures (in different fields) and frequently changing attitudes, norms, and sponsor requirements for open science. The present-day data management practices and attitudes in materials science are not well understood. In this article, we collect information on the practices of a selection of materials scientists at two leading universities, using a semi-structured interview instrument. An analysis of these interviews reveals that although data management is universally seen as important, data management practices vary widely.

It closely follows Brown's model of L2 speech perception and L1 feature geometry (1998), which seeks to relate theories of segmental phonology to L2 speech perception and the first exposure treatment of Gullberg et al. (2010). Eight Arabic sounds were carefully selected for the experiment: /b/-/d/ which are found in both English and Arabic; /x/-/ɣ/ which are not found in English but are distinguished by features which are distinctive in English [dorsal, voice, continuant], and lastly the contrastive pairs /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/, where the latter phoneme in each pair is alien to the phonemic inventory of English. These pairs are distinguished by the feature [RTR (retracted tongue root)] which is lacking in the feature geometry of English. Participants were divided into an Arabic control group, English+ group with prior exposure to Arabic, and an English group with no prior exposure to Arabic. The results from an AX discrimination task confirmed Brown's hypothesis that L2 perception of non-native contrasts is constrained by the L1 feature geometry.",TRUE,FALSE,first exposure of L2|L1 feature geometry|L2 speech perception|Phonology,2019-09-11T12:47:50.260956,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-11T12:47:14.463131,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/citation/,nzp85,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d77e55daf0253001ba60cb1/,5d77e55daf0253001ba60cb1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzp85/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nzp85/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nzp85,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.236

It uses a mixed method approach, where the students’ essays were analyzed using systemic functional linguistics (SFL) in terms of the textual meta-function of cohesive devices. The five types of the cohesive devices are the following: lexical cohesion, reference, conjunction, substitutions, and ellipses. Moreover, each of their subcategories were analyzed in the students’ texts. The NVivo qualitative data analysis software and the corpus analysis (conducted using AntConc) were used to calculate the frequencies of each cohesive device found in the data. The IELTS writing assessment scale was also used to evaluate the students’ writing scores. The results show that the most frequently used device was lexical cohesion, specifically repetition. Saudi EFL undergraduate students tended to repeatedly stay focused on the central idea of the topic. Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation coefficient found a relationship between the students’ writing scores and length of their essays, the use of cohesive ties and the scores, and cohesive ties and the length of the students’ essays. This study recommends that EFL teachers provide Saudi EFL students several cohesive tools in order to help them improve their writing skills and connect their ideas smoothly.",TRUE,FALSE,cohesion|cohesive devices|essay writing|systemic functional linguistics (SFL),2019-09-11T12:48:09.633426,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-11T12:47:50.286517,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/citation/,zjx9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d77e47bd7413a001a63028b/,5d77e47bd7413a001a63028b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zjx9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zjx9k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zjx9k,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.241
