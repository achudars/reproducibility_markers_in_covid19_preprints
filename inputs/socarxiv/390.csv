structures that lead to such violence in the first place. Drawing from interviews with former
participants in empowerment programs that focus on building community leaders, the study
examines how grassroots women lead interventions and the resulting effects on leaders’ and
survivors’ lives. Findings suggest that although most survivors had displayed some agency in
independently resisting violence, their efforts are effective when coupled with a support network
and access to resources. With the intervention of leaders, the survivors were able to better
negotiate for justice with a renewed sense of agency. For the leaders, participation in programs
gave them an identity independent from their status within the family. They promoted change by
developing independent innovative intervention strategies that worked despite the tight structural
constraints of gendered norms.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-04-05T11:11:32.165803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T11:10:58.179282,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/citation/,3ujkb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca5650cc25afd001cdebeda/,5ca5650cc25afd001cdebeda,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3ujkb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3ujkb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3ujkb,NA

Although survey-linked mortality files play a prominent role in U.S. health disparities research, it is unclear how well mortality estimates from these datasets align with one another and whether they are comparable with U.S. vital statistics data. We conduct the first study that systematically compares mortality estimates from several widely-used survey-linked mortality files and U.S. vital statistics data. Our results show that mortality rates and life expectancies from the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files, Health and Retirement Study, Americans’ Changing Lives study, and U.S. vital statistics data are similar. Mortality rates are slightly lower and life expectancies are slightly higher in these linked datasets relative to vital statistics data. Compared with vital statistics and other survey-linked datasets, General Social Survey-National Death Index life expectancy estimates are much lower at younger adult ages and much higher at older adult ages. Cox proportional hazard models regressing all-cause mortality risk on age, gender, race, educational attainment, and marital status conceal the issues with the General Social Survey-National Death Index that are observed in our comparison of absolute measures of mortality risk.

This is a significant omission given that disability severely limits opportunities and contributes to cumulative disadvantage. We draw from feminist disability and intersectional theories to account for how disability intersects with gender, race, and education to produce economic insecurity. The findings from our analyses of 2015 American Community Survey data provide strong empirical support for hierarchies of disadvantage, where women and racial minority groups with disabilities and less education experience the highest poverty levels, report the lowest total income, and have a greater reliance on sources outside the labor market for economic security.

The Wealth Consequences of Raising Children","This study uses 1986-2012 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort data to investigate the relationship between raising children and net worth among younger baby boomer parents. I combine fixed effects and unconditional quantile regression models to estimate changes in net worth associated with having children in different age groups across the wealth distribution. This allows me to test whether standard economic models for savings and consumption over the life course hold for families at different wealth levels. My findings show that the wealth effects of children vary throughout the distribution. Among families at or below the median, children of all ages were associated with wealth declines, likely due to the costs of childrearing. However, at the 75th percentile and above, wealth increased with the presence of younger children but decreased once those children reached age 18.

A simultaneous discussion on the role of automation in unemployment complicates the political narrative; by one estimate, 47% of American jobs are at risk of computerization (Frey and Osborne, 2013). This study analyzes how occupational automation corresponds with racial and ethnic demographics within occupational groups from both a historical and contemporary perspective. I find that throughout American industrialization, non-White and immigrant workers shifted to low-wage, unskilled work because of the political and social limitations imposed upon these groups. In the context of today’s AI-driven automation, I find that White workers are more heavily affected by automatability than other racial groups. Conversely, however, I found that the proportion of White workers in an occupation is negatively correlated with an occupation’s automatability. I conclude with suggestions for a susceptibility-based approach to predicting employment outcomes from AI-driven automation.",TRUE,FALSE,artificial intelligence|automation|ethnicity|labor|race|skill|work,2019-04-02T12:34:27.233509,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-02T12:34:02.568767,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Pegah Moradi,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/citation/,e37cu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca258dcecd788001998c0ac/,5ca258dcecd788001998c0ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e37cu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e37cu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e37cu,NA

HAALSI population-based study of over 5000 individuals aged ≥ 40 years in rural South Africa
fit with three existing theories of how social engagement and cognitive function are
interconnected in older age. We found that respondents with lower cognitive function had
smaller, denser social networks that were more local and more kin-based than their peers.
Lower cognitive function was associated with receipt of less social support in general, but this
difference was stronger for emotional and informational than for financial and physical
support. These patterns suggest that cognitively impaired older adults in this setting rely on
their core social networks for support, and that theories developed in higher-income and
higher-education settings may also apply elsewhere in the world.",TRUE,FALSE,cognition|cognitive impairment|gender|social engagement|social networks|social support|South Africa,2019-04-02T12:33:48.403883,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-02T12:33:32.099865,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/citation/,cp4zk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca21fc00a13d700198cc192/,5ca21fc00a13d700198cc192,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp4zk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cp4zk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cp4zk,NA
