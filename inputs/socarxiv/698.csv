Users of darknet markets refer to product quality as one of the motivations for buying drugs there, and vendors present quality as a selling point. However what users understand by quality and how they evaluate it is not clear. This paper investigates how users established and compared drug quality. 
Methods
We used a two-stage method for investigating users' assessments. The user forum of a darknet market that we called 'Merkat' was analysed to develop emergent themes. Qualitative interviews with darknet users were conducted, then forum data was analysed again.  To enhance the applicability of the findings, the forum was sampled for users who presented as dependent as well as recreational.
Results
Quality could mean reliability, purity, potency, and predictability of effect.  We focused on the different kinds of knowledge users drew on to assess quality. These were: embodied; craft; and chemical. 
Conclusion.
Users’ evaluations of quality depended on their experience, the purpose of use, and its context.

This paper discusses an interconnection between diversity and technology: web accessibility for all, including people with disabilities. Qualitative interviews were conducted with eight MLIS professors and two students or recent alumni.  Findings showed attitudes regarding teaching web accessibility and recruitment of a diverse student body varied between professors who were familiar with web accessibility and those who were not.  Participants who were familiar with web accessibility often thought it should be included within ALA Standards for Accreditation.  Findings suggested that, in one school, incorporating diversity in their curriculum, including web accessibility, allowed recruitment of a more diverse student body and was furthering diversity-related curriculum content. At another school, a professor expressed concern about recruiting a diverse student body, particularly students with disabilities.  The research suggests that stronger practices for teaching technology, teaching diversity, and recruiting diverse students could assist the field of LIS to further realize its inclusive goals.

Within substance abuse research, quantitative methodologists tend to view randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the “gold standard” for estimating causal effects, in part due to experimental manipulation and random assignment. Such methods are not always possible due to ethical and other reasons. Causal directed acyclic graphs (causal DAGs) are mathematical tools for (1) precisely stating researchers' causal assumptions and (2) providing guidance regarding the specification of statistical models for causal inference with nonexperimental data (such as epidemiological data). Purpose. This manuscript describes causal DAGs and illustrates their use in regards to a long standing theory within the field of substance use: the gateway hypothesis. Design. Data from the 2013 National Survey of Drug Use and Health are utilized to illustrate the application of causal DAGs in model specification. Then using the model specification constructed via causal DAGs, logistic regression models are used to generate odds ratios of the likelihood of trying heroin, given that one has tried alcohol, marijuana, and/or tobacco. Conclusion. Granting the assumptions encoded in specific causal DAGs, researchers, even in the absence of RCTs, can identify and estimate causal effects of interest.",TRUE,FALSE,acyclic graphs|substance abuse researchers,2018-07-02T10:59:34.541420,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-16T15:43:55.563355,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/citation/,8k7sp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vkdch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/relationships/node/,vkdch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5943fb94b83f690229ba0f15/,5943fb94b83f690229ba0f15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8k7sp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8k7sp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8k7sp,https://doi.org/10.4303/jdar/235992

Mobile health interventions (mhealth) are a way to address existing barriers to treatment, provide frontline assessment and increase access to services for older adults. Due to perpetuated stereotypes, many assume that older adults do not utilize mobile technology nor will they accept a mHealth intervention. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize contemporary literature from information technology and healthcare regarding: (1) current mobile technology utilization by older adults, particularly in regards to health; (2) factors affecting older adult motivation to engage with mobile technology; and (3) older adult preferences for interacting with mobile technology. Findings reveal that significant proportions of older adults: already utilize mobile technology; are willing to engage in existing mobile interventions for health reasons; and have positive attitudes overall towards mobile technology.

Decomposition does not imply reduction, as emergence of higher level phenomena from the interaction of persons, their relations, and processes of recombination, transmission, learning, and memory is allowed for.

It has emerged as a distinct component of heavy drinking practice among young adults approximately between the ages of 18-25. This paper examines reflective accounts of female students’ pre-drinking and club-drinking. It explores the experience of pre-drinking in the context of the overall drinking sequence undertaken throughout the evening in and the night out. It finds that pre-drinking has a specific purpose for young women in managing risk, as well as ensuring a shared level of intoxication in preparation for entry into public drinking spaces.  Their accounts illustrate the performative nature of intoxication. Pre-drinking is highly directed, bounded, and ritualised. It was frequently, though not always, recounted as lacking in pleasure for these reasons.  It was associated with preparation for entry to a particular kind of superpub or nightclub especially, where the emphasis was on further rapid alcohol consumption.  Accounts of continued drinking in the nightclubs were dualistic, emphasising pleasure and disgust, along with risk and vulnerability. Risk was experienced as individualised, and the women had shared responsibility for guarding against risk from unsafe others in the nightclub environment. This coding of risk is supported by public health messages targeted at women drinkers and by the more general societal and drinks industry promoted representation of alcohol consumption as normal and abstinence as deviant, which students were critical of.  One attraction of pre-drinking for female students was as a way of protecting and supporting female agency in conditions of generalised, individualised vulnerability.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|alcohol|binge drinking|gender|predrinking|students,2018-07-02T10:59:34.376343,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-16T09:15:38.373927,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Angus Bancroft,2012,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/citation/,7hf8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z2rcp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/relationships/node/,z2rcp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5943a144594d900047bee77a/,5943a144594d900047bee77a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hf8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7hf8t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7hf8t,https://doi.org/10.5153/sro.2785

We use the example of the darknet to critically examine this approach. We explore the background assumptions that have been made about anonymity as a quality of social life. We conceive of anonymity as a way of engaging and maintaining social relationships in an anonymous mode. We draw on a study of darknet ‘cryptomarket’ users who mainly use the darknet to buy and sell illicit drugs, discuss drug quality and share information on safe and effective use. We identify the personal satisfaction that comes from interacting anonymously online, the challenges this represents for maintaining trusted interactions and how they are overcome, and the combination of technology and action involved in maintaining anonymity. We argue that attempts to promote de-anonymising norms and technology are based on an erroneous understanding of what anonymity is.",TRUE,FALSE,anonymity|cryptomarkets|darknet|digital sociology|drugs|Tor,2018-07-02T10:59:34.349340,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-16T09:07:31.002775,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Angus Bancroft|Peter Scott Reid,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/citation/,769xf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8uhjm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/relationships/node/,8uhjm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59439c27594d900044beba5a/,59439c27594d900044beba5a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/769xf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/769xf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/769xf,https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1187643

Individual characteristics of trustees, as determinants for being trusted, are thus getting increasingly important. In light of this societal development, this study is concerned with socioeconomic status and reputation as part of the explanans for interpersonal trust. Some have argued that lower status trustees are trusted more easily because of their repeated reliance on resources in their social network. Others state that higher status trustees are trusted more easily, for they are more vulnerable to social control and loss of reputation.

We propose a novel, quasi-experimental method for examining interpersonal trust situations mimicking the reality of peer-to-peer market platforms. 626 respondents were asked to place trust in their preferable trustee based on the asking price, and seller's characteristics. Conditional logistic regression models were estimated and showed that status increases perceived trustworthiness, and positively affects the trust premium for past trustworthy behavior. Strong reputation effects were found, sending out a warning for inequitable emergent hierarchies through reputation cascading.",TRUE,FALSE,peer-to-peer markets|reputation|socioeconomic status|trust|vignette experiment,2018-07-02T10:59:34.278915,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-16T07:35:20.647641,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Marijn A.

Previous studies have indicated that low-density, spatially expansive development patterns are costly to provide public services leading to higher per capita expenditures. However, theory would suggest alternate outcomes. These two possibilities are examined empirically using a panel dataset of U.S. county areas from 1982 to 2012 and a specification allowing for a potential non-linearity between development patterns and per capita expenditures. Estimates indicate that the spatial extent of urban development is the most important, suggesting that more compact development is less costly to provide public services. Increased density increases per capita expenditures suggesting ""urban harshness""; however, the effects are quantitatively small.",TRUE,FALSE,local government finance|population density|urban sprawl,2018-07-02T10:59:34.144376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-15T21:51:19.883703,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/citation/,wzcgj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2nmjw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/relationships/node/,2nmjw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59430104b83f69022cb9f5e9/,59430104b83f69022cb9f5e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wzcgj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wzcgj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wzcgj,https://doi.org/10.1111/pbaf.12239
