Government regulation may or may not promote either competition or
efficiency, depending on both the goals of the agency and the effects of
industry ""capture."" Antitrust courts have long included regulated
industries within their purview, working to ensure that regulated
industries could not use the limits that regulation imposes on the normal
competitive process to achieve anticompetitive ends. Doing so makes sense;
an antitrust law that ignored anticompetitive behavior in any regulated
industry would be a law full of holes.

The role of antitrust in policing regulated industries appears to be
changing, however. A cluster of Supreme Court decisions in the past decade
have fundamentally altered the relationship between antitrust and
regulation, placing antitrust law in a subordinate relationship that, some
have argued, requires it to defer not just to regulatory decisions but
perhaps even to the silence of regulatory agencies in their areas of
expertise.

Absolute antitrust deference to regulatory agencies makes little sense as a
matter either of economics or experience. Economic theory teaches that
antitrust courts are better equipped than regulators to assure efficient
outcomes in many circumstances. Public choice theory - and long experience
- suggests that agencies that start out trying to limit problematic
behavior by industries often end up condoning that behavior and even
insulating those industries from market forces. And as history has shown,
relying on regulatory oversight alone without the backdrop of antitrust law
would leave both temporal and substantive gaps in enforcement, which
unscrupulous competitors could exploit to the clear detriment of consumers.
The mere existence of a competition-conscious regulatory structure cannot
guarantee against abuses of that structure, or against exclusionary
behavior that falls just beyond its jurisdiction. Indeed - and perhaps
ironically - the very regulatory structure that exists to promote
competition can create gaming opportunities for competitors bent on
achieving anti-competitive goals. Such ""regulatory gaming"" undermines both
the regulatory system itself and the longstanding complementary
relationship between regulatory and antitrust law.

We argue that the risk of regulatory gaming provides an important example
of the need for ongoing antitrust oversight of regulated industries. We
define regulatory gaming as private behavior that harnesses pro-competitive
or neutral regulations and uses them for exclusionary purposes. We identify
three possible instances of regulatory gaming: (1) product-hopping, in
which the branded company makes repeated changes in drug formulation to
prevent generic substitution, rather than to improve the efficacy of the
drug product; (2) manipulation of government standard-setting
organizations; and (3) claims of price squeezes by partially regulated
industries.

Our goal in this paper is not to persuade the reader that these particular
examples of regulatory gaming do or do not violate the antitrust laws.
Rather, our point is that whether or not particular acts of regulatory
gaming harm competition is and should be an antitrust question, not merely
one that involves interpreting statutes or agency regulations. Some level
of antitrust enforcement - with appropriate deference to firm decisions
about product design and affirmative regulatory decisions that affect
market conditions - provides a necessary check on behavior, such as product
hopping, that has no purpose but to exclude competition.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:08.921870,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-26T18:42:33.442000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/citation/,sta5b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3mujd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/relationships/node/,3mujd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c08d9ab83f6901fcc4a577/,57c08d9ab83f6901fcc4a577,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sta5b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sta5b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sta5b

permitted to offer those TLDs for sale. In this article we focus on a
hitherto-neglected implication of ICANN's assertion that it is a private
rather than a public actor: its potential liability under the U.S.
antitrust laws, and the liability of those who transact with it. ICANN
argues that it is not as closely tied to the government as NSI and IANA
were in the days before ICANN was created. If this is correct, it seems
likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust immunity those actors
enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain competition, e.g.
its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate that their
proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's
preventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars
(requiring the UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized
as anticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be
subject to the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in
fact violated the antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust
state actor, whether the DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it
can shelter under precedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as
seems likely) a private ICANN and those who petition it are subject to
antitrust law, everyone involved in the process needs to review their

overshadowed online by the system of intermediary safe harbors enacted as
part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) in 1998. The Internet
safe harbors and the system of notice-and-takedown fundamentally changed
the incentives of platforms, users, and rightsholders in relation to claims
of copyright infringement. These different incentives interact to yield a
functional balance of copyright online that diverges markedly from the
experience of copyright law in traditional media environments. This article
also explores a second divergence: the DMCA’s safe harbor system is being
superseded by private agreements between rightsholders and large commercial
Internet platforms made in the shadow of those safe harbors. These
agreements relate to automatic copyright filtering systems, such as
YouTube’s Content ID, that not only return platforms to their gatekeeping
role, but encode that role in algorithms and software.

The normative implications of these developments are contestable. Fair use
and other axioms of copyright law still nominally apply online; but in
practice, the safe harbors and private agreements made in the shadow of
those safe harbors are now far more important determinants of online
behavior than whether that conduct is, or is not, substantively in
compliance with copyright law. The diminished relevance of substantive
copyright law to online expression has benefits and costs that appear
fundamentally incommensurable. Compared to the offline world, online
platforms are typically more permissive of infringement, and more open to
new and unexpected speech and new forms of cultural participation. However,
speech on these platforms is also more vulnerable to over-reaching claims
by rightsholders. There is no easy metric for comparing the value of
non-infringing expression enabled by the safe harbors to that which has
been unjustifiably suppressed by misuse of the notice-and-takedown system.
Likewise, the harm that copyright infringement does to rightsholders is not
easy to calculate, nor is it easy to weigh against the many benefits of the
safe harbors.

DMCA-plus agreements raise additional considerations. Automatic copyright
enforcement systems have obvious advantages for both platforms and
rightsholders; they may also allow platforms to be more  hospitable to
certain types of user content. However, automated enforcement systems may
also place an undue burden on fair use and other forms of non-infringing
speech. The design of copyright enforcement robots encodes a series of
policy choices made by platforms and rightsholders and, as a result,
subjects online speech and cultural participation to a new layer of private
ordering and private control. In the future, private interests, not public
policy will determine the conditions under which users get to participate
in online platforms that adopt these systems. In a world where
communication and expression is policed by copyright robots, the
substantive content of copyright law matters only to the extent that those
with power decide that it should matter.

requirement - that inventions must, to qualify for a patent, be not simply
new but sufficiently different that they would not have been obvious to the
ordinarily skilled scientist - is in dispute in almost every case, and it
is responsible for invalidating more patents than any other patent rule. It
is also perhaps the most vexing doctrine to apply, in significant part
because the ultimate question of obviousness has an I know it when I see it
quality that is hard to break down into objective elements. That hasn't
stopped the Federal Circuit from trying to find those objective elements.
In the last quarter-century, the court has created a variety of rules
designed to cabin the obviousness inquiry: an invention can't be obvious
unless there is a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art
elements or modify existing technology; an invention can't be obvious
merely because it is obvious to try; and so forth.

In KSR v. Teleflex, the Supreme Court rejected the use of rigid rules to
decide obviousness cases. In its place, the Court offered not a new test,
but a constellation of factors designed to discern whether the person
having ordinary skill in the art (the PHOSITA) would likely think to make
the patented invention. In short, the Court sought to take a realist
approach to obviousness - to make the obviousness determination less of a
legal construct and to put more weight on the factual determination of what
scientists would actually think and do about a particular invention.

As a general principle, this realist focus is a laudable one. The too-rigid
application of rules designed to prevent hindsight bias had led to a number
or results that defied common sense, including the outcome of KSR itself in
the Federal Circuit. But the realist approach has some (dare we say it)
nonobvious implications for evidence and procedure, both in the Patent and
Trademark Office (PTO) and in the courts. The greater focus on the
characteristics of individual cases suggests a need for evidence and
factual determinations, but the legal and structural framework under which
obviousness is tested makes it difficult to make and review those
determinations. The realist approach is also incomplete, because both the
knowledge of the PHOSITA and the way the court approaches so-called
secondary considerations of nonobviousness depend critically on the
counterfactual assumption that the PHOSITA, while ordinarily skilled, is
perfectly informed about the prior art. If we are to take a realist
approach to obviousness, we should make it a consistent approach, so the
ultimate obviousness determination actually reflects what scientists in the
field would actually think. So far, despite KSR, it does not. The result of
taking the realist approach seriously may be - to the surprise of many - a
law of obviousness that is in some respects more favorable to patentability
than the standard it displaced.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:31.789872,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-25T17:08:12.678000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/citation/,942dc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4mnsx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/relationships/node/,4mnsx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bf25fd594d9001fed0e18f/,57bf25fd594d9001fed0e18f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/942dc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/942dc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/942dc

copying their ideas, but the power to control the use of their idea even by
those who independently develop a technology with no knowledge of the
patent or the patentee. In an important paper, Samson Vermont challenges
this received wisdom, arguing that independent invention should be a
defense to patent infringement, just as it would be in copyright or trade
secret cases.

Independent invention has much to recommend it. The most significant
problem facing the patent system today is the rise of so-called ""patent
trolls"" - entities who do not manufacture products or transfer technology,
but wait and assert patents against successful companies who independently
developed and manufactured the technology without knowledge of the patent.
An independent invention defense would eliminate the troll problem in one
fell swoop. Nonetheless, I have concerns. While I agree with Vermont that
we can learn a great deal from the fact of independent invention, I am not
yet persuaded that we can be sure that an independent invention defense
will have no undue effect on incentives. Complicating this difficult
empirical question is the likelihood that the effects of an independent
invention defense would be different in different industries. Further, an
independent invention defense will significantly change any market for
patent rights that might exist or be developing today.

In light of this, I suggest four steps we might take that take advantage of
Vermont's insights without moving all the way to an independent invention
system. First, we should change the definition of willful infringement to
exclude independent inventors. Second, we should adopt some form of a prior
user right. Third, we should give simultaneous invention greater credence
in determining whether inventions are obvious. Finally, we might consider
whether the defendant independently invented as a factor in deciding
whether to grant injunctive relief and the conditions to impose on such
relief.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:48.774173,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:13:55.258000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/citation/,pvsu7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xwg7p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/relationships/node/,xwg7p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be1c24594d9001fdd0e005/,57be1c24594d9001fdd0e005,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pvsu7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pvsu7

to own ground given up during patent prosecution. Under the old rule,
called the ""flexible bar,"" estoppel was based on a multi-factor test and
would apply only if the patentee had no choice but to amend its claims in
the way it did. Festo replaced the flexible bar with an ""absolute bar,""
under which virtually any amendment to a patent precludes resort to the
doctrine of equivalents for that claim element.

The Supreme Court is now considering whether the flexible or absolute bar
is the right rule. We believe there is middle ground in this debate that
has been ignored with both parties. Whether prosecution history estoppel
applies to any given amendment should depend on the reasonably foreseeable
effect of that amendment. Normally, patentees will understand that they are
surrendering coverage by amending their patent claims, and so a rule
precluding them from reclaiming that ground makes sense. But in some cases
the absolute bar will produce unexpected and unintended results. We argue
that the application of estoppel should turn on whether the effect of a
change would be foreseeable to a reasonable patentee at the time of the
amendment. This ""foreseeable"" bar better balances the competing policies of
strong protection for pioneering inventors and notice to improvers who wish
to design around a patent.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:49.144487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:12:22.079000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/citation/,pz3tj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/944zt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/relationships/node/,944zt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be1bc7594d9001fed0e067/,57be1bc7594d9001fed0e067,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pz3tj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pz3tj

between the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s works. But while every circuit
agrees on the centrality of substantial similarity, that basic agreement
conceals surprising differences in what exactly we mean by substantial
similarity and how it is to be proven in court. And the majority approach,
defined by the Second Circuit in Arnstein v. Porter and the Ninth Circuit
in Sid and Marty Krofft, has the analysis of proof exactly backwards –
permitting analytic dissection of the works and expert testimony where the
question is one that should be handed to the members of the jury, and
falling back on the “ordinary observer” test on the very questions that
require careful dissection by the court. I argue that the Arnstein and
Krofft tests make no sense. A better model draws from software copyright
cases, which give filtration and dissection of unprotectable elements a
more central role.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:13.764491,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:10:07.394000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/citation/,3t97e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g6wr2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/relationships/node/,g6wr2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be1b406c613b01edd955e2/,57be1b406c613b01edd955e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3t97e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3t97e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3t97e

significant new challenges to the enforcement of copyright law. Copyright
owners' initial response to these challenges - to try to shut down the
technologies that facilitate file sharing - is bad for society. We
suggested that it would be preferable to lower enforcement costs for
copyright owners by making dispute resolution by copyright owners against
direct infringers quick and cheap, so that copyright owners would be more
inclined to pursue such direct infringers instead of suing innovators.
While enforcement costs are likely always to be too great to allow pursuit
of every infringer, lower costs would allow for enforcement against more
infringers, increasing any given infringer's chance of being sued. In this
article, we explain how such a dispute resolution system might work, and
propose a draft amendment to the copyright act to implement the system.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:36.658698,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:08:48.900000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/citation/,am6ur,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4zh4q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/relationships/node/,4zh4q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be1afab83f6901f765683f/,57be1afab83f6901f765683f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am6ur/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/am6ur/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/am6ur
