These relational systems feature interdependencies that result in inferential shortcomings and poorly-fitting models when ignored. General advancements in inferential network analysis have improved our ability to understand relational systems featuring interdependence, but developments specific to working with interdependence that cross relational contexts remain sparse. In this paper, I introduce a multilayer network approach to modeling systems comprising multiple relations using the exponential random graph model.

However, they leave open the question of whether climate politics and other politically salient issues exhibit tendencies for issue alignment, which the political polarization literature identifies as among the most deleterious aspects of polarization. Using a network approach and social media data from the Twitter platform, we study polarization of public opinion toward climate politics and ten other politically salient topics during the 2019 Finnish elections as the emergence of opposing groups in a public forum. We find that while climate politics is not particularly polarized compared to the other topics, it is subject to partisan sorting and issue alignment within the universalist-communitarian dimension of European politics that arose following the growth of right-wing populism.

Orthogonal polynomial contrasts provide a useful way to incorporate the information that the groups are ordered, unlike dummy or effects coding. This technique has been useful to separate the linear and non-linear effects in age-period-cohort (APC) models. This paper addresses three practical issues when implementing orthogonal polynomial contrasts: First, if the linear effect is to be interpreted, it should be identical to the linear effect that we obtain if we treat the predictor as a metric variable. Second, if the data is unbalanced, weighted orthogonal contrasts need to be used to obtain unbiased estimates. Third, by dropping-higher order terms, orthogonal polynomials can easily be used to smooth non-linear estimates. Two examples from the APC literature are discussed, and it is found that the use of unweighted polynomials has led to small biases in the results. A R function is provided that implements weighted polynomials with an interpretable linear term.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-06T10:18:00.754168,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-06T10:17:43.943611,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,NA,Benjamin Elbers,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/citation/,xrbgv,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f02f609af115601b83b8aa0/,5f02f609af115601b83b8aa0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrbgv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xrbgv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xrbgv,NA

However, introducing rhetoric that causes respondents to view automation-induced inequality as unfair increases preferences for several redistributive policies.

Using a novel data set consisting of mainstream newspapers, Twitter and forum data, the study answers two questions: What do Swedish media actually talk about when they talk about “migration”? And how do they talk about it? Using a combination of computational text analysis tools, I analyze a shift in the media discourse seen as one of the outcomes of the European refugee crisis in 2015 and try to understand the role of social media in this process. The results of the study indicate that messages on social media generally had negative tonality and suggest that some of the media frames can be attributed to a migration-hostile discourse. At the same time, the analysis of framing and sentiment dynamics provides little evidence for the discourse shift and any long-term effects of the European refugee crisis on the Swedish media discourse.

Different authors have put forth arguments in favor of introducing this practice in qualitative research and made suggestions for what to include in a qualitative preregistration form. The goal of this study was to gauge and understand what parts of preregistration templates qualitative researchers would find helpful and informative. We used an online Delphi study design consisting of two rounds with feedback reports in between. In total, 48 researchers participated (response rate: 16%). In round 1, panelists considered 14 proposed items relevant to include in the preregistration form, but 2 items had relevance scores below our predefined criterion (68%) with mixed argument and were put forth again. We combined items where possible, leading to 11 revised items. In round 2, panelists agreed on including the two remaining items. Panelists also converged on suggested terminology and elaborations, except for two terms for which they provided clear arguments. The result is an agreement-based form for the preregistration of qualitative studies that consists of 13 items.

Given the ease at which misinformation spreads on these platforms it is important for scientists to present their findings in a manner that appears credible. To examine the extent to which the online presentation of science information relates to its perceived credibility, we designed and conducted two surveys on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In the first survey, participants rated the credibility of science information on Twitter compared with the same information other platforms, and in the second, participants rated the credibility of tweets with modified characteristics: presence of an image, text sentiment, and the number of likes/retweets. We find that similar information about scientific findings is perceived as less credible when presented on Twitter compared to other platforms, and that perceived credibility increases when presented with recognizable features of a scientific article. On a platform as widely distrusted as Twitter, use of these features may allow researchers who regularly use Twitter for research-related networking and communication to present their findings in the most credible formats.",TRUE,FALSE,Credibility|Scholarly Communication|Science Communication|Social Media|Twitter,2020-07-06T15:56:40.924914,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-06T15:56:13.480592,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/murrayds/sci-online-credibility,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/citation/,4dhcz,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f029aa6ea59af01afd39b31/,5f029aa6ea59af01afd39b31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4dhcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4dhcz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4dhcz,NA

It is unclear whether their religious affiliation shapes Catholics' views on public policy issues, ranging from the legality of abortion to criminal justice practices.  Capital punishment is especially salient, given that Pope Francis announced in 2018—as official Catholic Church doctrine—that the death penalty is “inadmissible” under all circumstances.  Based on two national surveys, the current project explores Catholics' support for state executions before (2017) and after (2019) the Pope's momentous change in the church's Catechism.  At present, little evidence exists that Pope Francis's doctrinal reform has impacted Catholics, a majority of whom—like Americans generally—continue to favor the death penalty for murders.  Data from our 2020 MTurk survey shows that only 12.7% of Catholic respondents could correctly identify the Church's position on capital punishment.  Despite these results, Pope Francis's teachings provide Catholic leaders and activists with a compelling rationale for opposing the death penalty and holding Catholic public officials accountable for espousing offenders' execution.  Further, for the next generation of Catholics, instruction in the impermissibility of capital punishment, as part of the Church's consistent ethic of life, will be integral to their religious training.",TRUE,FALSE,Capital punishment|Catholics|death penalty|Pope Francis|public opinion|religion,2020-07-05T17:56:01.016531,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-05T17:55:37.605682,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/citation/,yv86c,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f020f6abee6650198f9a626/,5f020f6abee6650198f9a626,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yv86c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yv86c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yv86c,NA
