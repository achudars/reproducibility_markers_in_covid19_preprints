However, empirical results to date are inconsistent and limited, which is partly due to a lack of psychometrically sound measures for children’s social pretend play competence. The current study aimed to compare and validate different assessment methods for children’s social pretend play competence. In total, 64 3- to 4-year-old children participated in the study (age: M = 46.4, SD = 3.8). Assessments were conducted twice, three months apart. Social pretend play competence was assessed using a standardized role play test (Tools of the Play Scale), a social pretend play situation with a peer (Dyadic Pretend Play Assessment), and a teacher report. Children’s Theory of Mind, emotion understanding, and language comprehension were assessed. Educators reported on children’s social-emotional skills. Research Findings: All three instruments showed a good factorial validity, measurement invariance and sensitivity to intra-individual change. A second-order factor of all three methods was identified. The Tools of the Play Scale and the teacher report yielded good criterion validity. The second-order factor showed even better criterion validity: Children with higher social pretend play competence showed higher social-cognitive skills as well as social-emotional skills.

It came as havoc for developing countries like India. It has compelled the human society to maintain social distancing and made people mandatory to sit indoor. It has significantly disrupted the education sector which is a critical determinant of economic future of a country. Many educational institutions around the world have closed their campuses and moved for online teaching-learning mode. In India, about 32 crore learners stopped to move schools/colleges and all educational activities brought to an end. The outbreak of Covid-19 has worked as a catalyst for the educational institutions to grow with digital technologies, which has never happened before. The educational institutions have managed to ensure the continuity of educational activities with digital technologies during the pandemic and are expecting the same trend to continue. This paper highlights some measures taken by Govt. of India to provide seamless education in the country during the pandemic Covid-19.  Various challenges and opportunities created by Covid-19 on education are discussed. Some of the post Covid-19 trends which may allow imagining the new ways of teaching learning in India are outlined.

So to overcome this condition there is a need of such education which was predicted by Mahatma Gandhi like ‘Basic Education’ or ‘Nai-Talim’. Gandhi realized that the basic education was an essential component to the structural and socio-economic imbalances that were badly affected. It was the treatment for all the ills and evils of the society in India. His idea on basic education not only changed the educational system of India but also led a social revolution.

A better understanding of educational inequalities in cancer is becoming increasingly important. However, only a few studies have focused the attention on the causal effect of education on cancer risk and mortality. This quasi-experimental design exploits the exogenous variation in compulsory schooling due to policy changes in 1947 and 1972 in England and Wales using data from the ONS Longitudinal Study (ONS LS). These educational reforms affected a large proportion of the population. The identification of the causal effect of education on cancer risk and survival is achieved using the regression discontinuity framework with categorical outcomes. Therefore, this work aims at studying the effect of education on the probability of developing, surviving and dying from cancer. Results show that the 1947 and 1972 educational reforms do not seem to be causally related to cancer incidence and mortality. This study suggests the absence of a causal role of one additional year of compulsory schooling on cancer outcomes. Among the reasons for the absence of causal evidence there are the heterogeneity by cancer site as well as the local effect of the compulsory school reforms.",TRUE,FALSE,cancer|causality|educational reforms|health inequality|natural experiment,2021-01-07T09:05:42.083375,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-07T08:56:28.043639,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be access after authorization process by ONS.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",Cecilia Potente,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/citation/,nj7x2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff6ba8d86541a004614ac25/,5ff6ba8d86541a004614ac25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj7x2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nj7x2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nj7x2

Evidence from a labor market field experiment in three countries,"Do employers prioritize the name of the university someone graduated from above an applicant’s skills in the employment process? 2,400 fictitious applications were submitted to IT and accounting job openings in three countries: United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. The resumes belonged to fictitious citizens, both female and male, that have attended universities of varying prestige in the respective countries. For each sector of the labor market, two resumes were designed. One resume had a high skills match with the generic requirements of entry level jobs in each sector. A second resume had a low skills match with the same requirements. For each country, one high-ranked university and one non-high-ranked university were selected to signal prestige. The name of the university the applicant graduated from and their sex were randomly assigned on otherwise identical resumes. This study distinguished between the effects of human capital from the effect of the name of the graduating university—while controlling for networking effects—in the hiring process. Human capital was statistically significant in predicting callbacks. Applications in the high skills match condition were 79% more likely to receive a callback than applications in the low skills match condition.

It presents a qualitative analysis of sixteen in-depth stakeholder interviews in Hunan, Hubei and Henan. We reveal tensions between a segmented model of governance and a centralised model, between a centralised top-down model and stakeholder participation, and between a public model and a private, decentral market where corporate reputation must result in transparency and trust. Stakeholders also see gaps between ideals of inclusive, transparent and participatory governance, and effective problem-solving. Governance of food safety in China, even when targeting inclusion and public accountability, remains heavily dependent on the central state as a pivotal actor.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|China|food|food safety|governance|melamine|milk|risk assessment|risk communication|safety,2021-01-07T15:58:00.832708,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-07T13:21:52.613019,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/citation/,43r8a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff5934ee9ccb905fcaf08c5/,5ff5934ee9ccb905fcaf08c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43r8a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/43r8a/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/43r8a

An early revision combined the Rose Spring Corner-notched and Eastgate Expanding-stem types into a combined Rosegate type with an end date of  900-1000 AD. Some archaeologists recognize that these projectile points persist to approximately 1300 AD but others use the earlier dates. Furthermore, there is a varied approach to these types. Some use the original two types, while others use Rosegate or a combination of Rosegate, Rose Spring, and Eastgate. We used projectile point typology data, illustrations, and photographs to study the temporal range and morphological variation of Rosegate points. We found that Rosegate points are common throughout the Fremont period, with some decline over time. A spatial analysis demonstrates that the points are found throughout the Fremont region but are not evenly distributed. Our morphological analysis does not support the separation of Rosegate points into two distinct types.",TRUE,FALSE,Fremont|Geometric morphometrics|Projectile points|Rosegate,2021-01-07T15:56:02.750243,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-07T13:19:17.110479,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/3ufte/?view\_only=9690c4b8ee2e4cc9b9b0251f98d48dd1,no,None,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/citation/,dwrba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3ufte/,3ufte,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff57665e9ccb905f4aed1d6/,5ff57665e9ccb905f4aed1d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwrba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dwrba/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dwrba
