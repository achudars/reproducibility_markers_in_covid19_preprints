Drawing on an original dataset of TikTok videos, the visualization charts a considerable increase in the number of “coming out” gender identity and sexual orientation videos during the latter three quarters of 2020.

In this paper, we suggest that this common “coping strategies” model can be extended to account for mechanisms that link environmental conditions to migration behavior over longer periods of time. We argue that early-life climate exposures may affect the likelihood of migration from childhood through early adulthood by influencing parental migration, community migration networks, human capital development, and decisions about household resource allocation, all of which are correlates of geographic mobility. We evaluate this expectation empirically using a “big data” approach, analyzing georeferenced records from 81 censuses implemented across 31 countries in tropical Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. For each world region, we estimate multivariate regression models that predict lifetime migration through ages 30-39 as a function of temperature and precipitation in early life, defined as the year prior to birth through age four. Results suggest that early-life climate is systematically associated with changes in the probability of lifetime migration in most regions of the tropics, with the largest effects observed in sub-Saharan Africa. In East and Southern Africa, the effects of temperature shocks vary by sex and educational attainment and in a manner that suggests women and those with lower socioeconomic status are most vulnerable to climate shocks. Finally, we compare our main results with models using alternative measures of climate exposure. This comparison suggests climate exposures during the prenatal period and first few years of life are particularly (but not exclusively) salient for lifetime migration, which is most consistent with our proposed human capital mechanism.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|demography|human capital|migration,2021-04-07T14:12:42.775894,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-07T14:06:42.270907,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be accessed via IPUMS-International (with registration) and the Climate Research Unit Time Series website.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Brian Thiede|Heather Randell|Clark Gray,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/citation/,a96wf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606ba240f2ad3301d5a7b52d/,606ba240f2ad3301d5a7b52d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a96wf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a96wf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a96wf,NA

As a result, they may unwittingly send applications to vacancies with a lot of competition and may overlook vacancies with little competition. We study how providing information about competition for a vacancy redirects applications. To do so, we conduct three field experiments on a large online job platform in which treated job searchers are shown information about the number of prior applicants to a vacancy. This information increases overall applications and redirects applications to vacancies with few prior applications. Applications are sent to vacancies that receive fewer cumulative applications but result in similar outcomes to control applications. We use a complementary treatment to show that job seekers also use the age of the vacancy to direct search towards newer vacancies with relatively little competition.

Our formal theoretical model implies that the efficiency of electronic word of mouth is determined by the quality of the underlying crowdfunding campaign. Using a sample of 572 project observations, we test our theoretical predictions in cross-sectional logistic regression and ancillary Granger analyses. Our results highlight the interactive contingency of social media engagement and the success of the crowdfunding campaign. While a higher quality campaign is benefitting from user generated electronic word of mouth (online comments), the returns are diminishing. For mass personal electronic word of mouth (Facebook shares), we even find a reverse causal effect.

They may not think about everything, yet they certainly think of something and make decisions. Critical thinking is a sort of reflective thinking. It is controlled and aimed at perfect thinking. It enables the self-realization of individuals in social life. Therefore, it is important to develop critical thinking at school stages and early ages. The purpose of this research was to investigate “the effect of foreign language learning activities on critical thinking skills of 4th-grade students”. To achieve this purpose, researchers tried to answer these questions: (1) What is the effect of critical thinking activities on students’ critical thinking? (2) What is the effect of critical thinking activities on students’ personal definitions of critical thinking and critical thinker? (3) What is the effect of critical thinking activities on students’ social skills? The method of this research is action research which is considered highly important for educational sciences. In the course of this research, activities for developing critical thinking skills were implemented to 4th grade students. 25 4th grade private elementary school students participated in the research. Researchers used 13-question “Critical Thinking Skill Open-ended Questionnaire” to collect data. The answers given to the open-ended questionnaire before and after the activities were analyzed using content analysis, and themes and codes were determined accordingly, thereby answers of the students are compared.
