The results indicate that, although lying and violent acts augur negative consequences for those who commit them, their associations with core religious values diverge in the final outcome for the folktale characters. Lying that serves a religious mission of either Confucianism or Taoism (but not Buddhism) brings a positive outcome to a character (βT_and_Lie_O= 2.23; βC_and_Lie_O= 1.47; βT_and_Lie_O= 2.23). A violent act committed to serving Buddhist missions results in a happy ending for the committer (βB_and_Viol_O= 2.55). What is highlighted here is a glaring double standard in the interpretation and practice of the three teachings: the very virtuous outcomes being preached, whether that be compassion and meditation in Buddhism, societal order in Confucianism, or natural harmony in Taoism, appear to accommodate two universal vices—violence in Buddhism and lying in the latter two.

The historically stable topoi of a decidedly ""free"" and ""scientific"" ""Bildung"" are elements of a strategy of academic positioning that facilitates distinction in favor of the humanities.

The article illustrates this with a case study of UK history departments and their assessment by the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and the Research Excellence Framework (REF), drawing on data from the three most recent assessments (RAE 2001, 2008, REF 2014). Symptoms of stratification are documented by the distribution of memberships in assessment panels, of research active staff, and of external research grants. Symptoms of a standardization are documented by the publications submitted to the assessments. The main finding is that the RAEs/REF and the selective allocation of funds they inform consecrate and reproduce a disciplinary center that, in contrast to the periphery, is well-endowed with grants and research staff, decides in panels over the quality standards of the field, and publishes a high number of articles in high-impact journals.

Entropy-maximizing spatial interaction models are a means of building parsimonious models that average over much of this small-scale complexity, while maintaining key large-scale structural features. Dynamic social interaction models extend this approach by allowing archaeologists to explore the co-evolution of human settlement systems and the networks of interaction that drive them. Yet, such models are often imprecise, relying on generalized notions of settlement ""influence"" and ""attractiveness"" rather than concrete material flows of goods and people. Here, I present a dis-aggregated spatial interaction model that explicitly resolves trade and migration flows and their combined influence on settlement growth and decline. I explore how the balance of costs and benefits of each type of interaction influence long-term settlement patterns. I find trade flows are the strongest determinant of equilibrium settlement structure, and that migration flows play a more transient role in balancing site hierarchies. This model illustrates how the broad toolkit for spatial interaction modeling developed in geography and economics can increase the precision of quantitative theory building in archaeology, and provides a road-map for connecting mechanistic models to the empirical archaeological record.",TRUE,FALSE,agricultural hinterland|archaeological networks|competition for resources|settlement patterns|spatial interaction model,2019-09-26T15:12:42.565612,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-26T15:12:02.526229,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/citation/,trbf8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8c5109c8a75d0019605f2a/,5d8c5109c8a75d0019605f2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/trbf8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/trbf8,NA

In this study, we argue that communication practices are an important but overlooked factor in the formation of useful advice relationships between entrepreneurs, particularly in the context of developing economies. We hypothesize that improving entrepreneurs’ communication practices will affect the relationships they form and have implications for their business performance. To test our theory, we conducted a field experiment in Togo with 301 entrepreneurs who were randomized into a communication practices intervention that was embedded in a business training program. We found that entrepreneurs who were exposed to better communication practices perceived interactions more cooperatively and exchanged more information during those interactions. Moreover, improving communication practices also led to a 50 percent increase in the number of relationships entrepreneurs formed with peers. These relationships exhibited more matching based on skill and were more ethnically diverse. Finally, communication practices training also substantially increased entrepreneurs’ business performance.

How academic obituaries consecrate research biographies,"Academics undertake considerable efforts in order to define positions for themselves and for their peers that are meaningful and convey who they “are”. The current article examines how academics manage the practical task of making sense of one another by analyzing the way in which academic obituaries beget and consecrate research biographies. A qualitative analysis of 216 obituaries published in academic journals from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, in physics, history, and sociology, and from the 1960s to the 2000s reveals (e)valuative practices that consecrate academic subjects. The results demonstrate how obituaries: (1) categorize academic subjects by positioning them within spheres of academic knowledge and institutional posts, and (2) legitimize academic subjects by applying biographical narratives of talent and merit. This biographical (e)valuation evokes naturally talented, highly devoted academic subjects with coherent research profiles, and omits both biographical hurdles and the decedent’s gender and class. The insights shed light on underlying academic virtues and values.",TRUE,FALSE,academic careers|academic obituaries|evaluation|narratives|positioning|research biographies,2019-09-25T15:32:25.474593,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-25T15:32:03.378079,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/citation/,cd4kv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8b6b0553713d00181e6555/,5d8b6b0553713d00181e6555,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cd4kv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cd4kv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cd4kv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2016.02.005
