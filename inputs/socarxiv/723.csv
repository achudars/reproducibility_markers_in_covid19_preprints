Living in a neighborhood context characterized by aggressive policing may affect one's mental health, especially for men who are the primary targets of police stops. We examine whether there is an association between psychological distress and neighborhood-level aggressive policing structures (i.e., frisking and use of force by police) and whether that association varies by gender. The 2009-2011 New York City (NYC) Stop, Question, and Frisk Database is aggregated to the neighborhood level (N=34) and merged with individual data from the 2012 NYC Community Health Survey (N= 8,066) via the United Hospital Fund neighborhood of respondents' residence. Weighted multilevel generalized linear models are used to assess main and gendered effects of neighborhood exposures to aggressive police stops on psychological distress measured with Kessler-6 items. The neighborhood stop rate exhibits inconsistent associations with psychological distress; however, neighborhood-level frisk and use of force densities are linked to higher levels of non-specific psychological distress among men, but not women. Specifically, men exhibit higher levels of nervousness, effort, worthlessness, and severe distress in aggressively surveilled neighborhoods. Male residents are affected by the escalation of stop-and-frisk policing in a neighborhood. Living in a context of aggressive policing should be considered an important risk factor that contributes to men's health.

One aspect of this public policy is a procedure known as Terry stops, which involves police temporarily detaining persons who may be acting criminally. While only a small percentage of these stops result in arrest, warrants, or the recovery of illegal materials, a sizeable portion become physically invasive (i.e., involve body searches and use of force). The health effects of invasive policing practices for the community at-large are unknown. Using microlevel health data from 2009-2012 NYC Community Health Survey nested within mesolevel data from the 2009-2012 NYC Stop, Question, and Frisk dataset, this study employs multilevel mixed effects models to evaluate contextual and ethnoracially-variant associations between invasive aspects of Terry stops and multiple dimensions of illness (poor/fair health, diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma episodes, body weight). Terry stops are, in fact, associated with worse health. The most consistent Terry measures associated with illness is the likelihood that stops will result in frisking. More limited deleterious effects can be attributed to the likelihood that stops will result in use of force and to minority-to-white ratios of frisk and use of force. The health effects of Terry stops vary by ethnoracial group in complex ways. For instance, the minority-to-white frisking ratio and the likelihood that stops will involve use of force increase certain dimensions of illness for minorities; meanwhile, the minority-to-white use of force ratio reduces the likelihood of diabetes for Blacks.

collected data (ICD) to make inferences about politics. This type of data
is sometimes referred to as “big data” but I avoid this term because of its
conflicting definitions (Monroe, 2012; Ward & Barker, 2013). ICD is data
that was created or collected primarily for a purpose other than analysis.
Within this broad definition, this chapter focuses particularly on data
generated through user interactions with websites. While ICD has been
around for at least half a century, the Internet greatly expanded the
availability and reduced the cost of ICD. Examples of ICD include data on
Internet searches, social media data, and user data from civic platforms.
This chapter briefly explains some sources and uses of ICD and then
discusses some of the potential issues of analysis and interpretation that
arise when using ICD, including the different approaches to inference that
researchers can use.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:50.393771,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T22:33:35.571000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/citation/,x7bfs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f74qb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/relationships/node/,f74qb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578c07c4b83f6901f2c062ed/,578c07c4b83f6901f2c062ed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7bfs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x7bfs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x7bfs

As most scholars, in the field of humanities, take intellectual property for granted, the representation of Kant like an intellectual property forerunner is still a dangerously mistaken commonplace. According to Kant's Architectonic of Pure Reason the philosopher is closer to a lawgiver than to an artificer, if philosophy is considered in its Weltbegriff or cosmopolitan concept (AA.03: 542.23-30). Because such a lawgiving is based upon that reason with which every human being is endowed, the laws of reason should be thought as public laws and not as individual, private creations. How could a public law be consistently viewed as an object of private intellectual property? Kant avoids such a contradiction because his justification of authors' right does not rely on intellectual property, but on the meaning and the function of both authors and publishers in the world of the public use of reason. Therefore, Kant's theory of copyright is compatible with the Weltbegriff of philosophy. Furthermore, more interestingly, it is also possible to demonstrate that it is consistent with his general theory of property, as stated in the Metaphysik der Sitten. The following essay, after presenting a short sketch of Kant's authors right as personal right, will introduce Fichte's theory of intellectual property to strengthen the case of Kant's rejection of intellectual property, by comparing his ideas with the theory of an actual intellectual property advocate, like Fichte. Eventually, to read the proposed interpretation of Kant in a wider theoretical perspective, it will attempt to connect it to his general theory of property of the Metaphysik der Sitten.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:24.050673,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T20:48:59.618000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/citation/,b9zfr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z44g7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/relationships/node/,z44g7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578bef3db83f6901f0c06370/,578bef3db83f6901f0c06370,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b9zfr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b9zfr
