I argue that by borrowing the story of Mary Shelley’s monster in Frankenstein, Saadawi manages to pinpoint the roots of the terrorism that has plagued Iraq since the American occupation. Terrorism emanates from fear. Fear is the monster that has been unleashed by the collapse of central authority which resulted in what Judith Butler has called ‘a precarious life’ in which sudden and violent death is always looming. In addition, the struggle for power among the new players in the Iraqi scene leads to selfishness, demagogy, and exploitation. The novel stresses the need to acknowledge that no one is free of blame. By acknowledging that that nobody is purely a victim or a victimizer, and by taking responsibility for one’s deed, there might be hope for a way out of the horrors of the civil strife and carnage.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic fiction|Frankenstein in Baghdad|Saadawi|Terrorism in Iraq,2018-07-02T10:46:23.644596,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:48:12.584000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/citation/,53y9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6kec2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/relationships/node/,6kec2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb77f8594d9001fa8abb0f/,58cb77f8594d9001fa8abb0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/53y9k/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no1.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/53y9k

In addition, there is lack in the translation literature of studies of authentic translations of tense and aspect from Arabic into English. The present study aims to fill this gap by examining the translation of tense and aspect from Arabic into English in a published translation made by a professional English translator. It also aims to clarify the evident confusion in understanding the categories of tense and aspect, particularly in languages that are as divergent as Arabic and English. In order to achieve these objectives, the researcher analyzed, compared, and explained examples drawn from selected chapters from Jonathan Wright’s (2009) English translation of Youssef Ziedan’s (2008) novel Azazeel. The researcher followed a descriptive analytical approach and, with the use of the quantitative approach, individually analyzed the English translations of the Arabic aspectual forms from Scrolls (chapters) One, Fourteen, and Twenty-four. The results of the study revealed that Wright’s (2009) English equivalents of the Arabic aspectual forms in Azazeel were mostly accurate.

The aim is to come up with a simple classification that facilitated the process of comparison between English and Arabic metaphorical expressions.

The result is that The Scarlet Letter shows the vivid image of Pearl in Islam.

The applied model has managed to address the majority of the problematic instances and has also identified strategies adopted to tackle them in the Arabic subtitles.

The data of the present study is derived from an Egyptian television hard-edged drama entitled Firqit Naji Atallah (lit. Naji Atallah Team), Episode 1 (2012), subtitled by a sample of twenty MA translation students, ten of whom enrolled in the second semester for the academic year 2013/2014 and the rest (also totalling ten) did the same, a year later, namely for the school year 2014/2015. The article clearly reveals that before PRB approach is introduced in actual translation classroom, translator trainees (i.e. experimental group) are faced with tremendously difficult problems linguistically, culturally and technically which may hinder communication, thought to be crucial to retain for the target audience. The PRB approach is then introduced whereby the other translator trainees are equipped with some theoretical insights apropos of subtitling norms, well-envisaged in two scholarly AVT works by Karamitroglou (1998) and Schwarz (2002). Being aware of the PRB approach, the translator trainees could therefore do the translation task with minimal linguistic, cultural and technical problems. The study concludes with some pedagogical implications that will hopefully help translator trainees do translation tasks with minimal communication breakdown and maximal communicative thrust drawing on PRB.",TRUE,FALSE,audiovisual translation|PRB approach|subtitler training|subtitling,2018-07-02T10:51:43.044783,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:11:18.145000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/citation/,mrpr2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/aa4s4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/relationships/node/,aa4s4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb6f24594d9001fe8ab9b7/,58cb6f24594d9001fe8ab9b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrpr2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrpr2/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no1.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrpr2

This novel portrays two schools of ineffectual native educators who seem to be antagonists: the traditional old school and the new modern intellectuals. Postcolonial/race theories of Fanon, Appiah, Du Bois, and Woodson as well as Gramsci’s notion of the “organic intellectual” are employed to get a clearer image of the role of intellectuals and politicians in shaping the future of a country in the post-independence era. The article concludes that intellectuals with European education may contribute to the corruption of their country due to reasons like divided loyalties, miseducation, and lack of communication with the public. Additionally, Achebe is critical of the current politicians and the excluded public. So, our analysis employs Woodson’s concept of “the miseducation of the Negro” because such “miseducation” produces incompetent politicians like Chief Nanga, weak intellectuals like Odili Samalu, and ignorant people like the public in the novel. Real hope against governmental corruption in Achebe's satirical novel can be found in integrating the class of intellectual/political leaders and the public and in a different kind of indoctrination, neither colonial nor neo-colonial. The truly educated class and the “organic intellectuals” produced from the public are key solutions for a better ""Nigeria."" Hence, this article highlights the role of politicized education in post-independence nation building and tackles the mishaps of nascent nationalism.",TRUE,FALSE,Chinua Achebe|Intellectuals|Politics|Postcolonialism|the Public,2018-07-02T10:49:08.006954,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:06:23.877000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/citation/,fstfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/23njv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/relationships/node/,23njv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb6dc89ad5a1020402557d/,58cb6dc89ad5a1020402557d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fstfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fstfd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fstfd
