As in Indonesia, literacy becomes a major issue since most of young Indonesian people decrease their tendency of reading books in their free time. Reading, either it is extensive or intensive ones, is an essential knowledge for everyone. Fictions are needed to be explored for better literacy. As English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students, English fiction is one of a good source to improve students ability in using English. By reading more fictions, EFL students can gain many benefits directly or indirectly to their English, and it can be seen easily from their fluency by using a special model named Poster Presentation. Furthermore, poster presentation can be used in teaching and learning as variations in reading activity. This research is to explore the use of fiction stories and Poster Presentations for Indonesian EFL students at Lambung Mangkurat University. There were some stages during the Fiction stories and poster presentation project which involved tutoring, group work, and the poster presentation. The students were asked to read short fiction stories, make a summary of it, and finally design the summary into posters. The tutoring part was beneficial to keep students understand the project. The questionnaire by using Likert-scale was distributed which to investigate students’ perception on the use of poster presentation in learning fiction stories. The results showed that the students interpret poster presentation to  improve their reading comprehension, communication, cooperation, collaboration, and creativity during the classroom interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,Extensive reading|fiction stories|poster comprehension,2019-06-04T11:30:23.278898,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:11:03.991903,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/citation/,xsnyg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5eb60b700fa001c9f8aa7/,5cf5eb60b700fa001c9f8aa7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsnyg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xsnyg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xsnyg

Jane’s journey towards maturity and independence is a long rocky way that shapes her identity and finally harmonizes her with society. Through many stations in her journey, Jane has to make tough moral choices and decisions to obtain healthy moral reasoning. Thus, this paper is meant to trace the protagonist’s moral development in the light of Lawrence Kohlberg’s moral theory. Jane’s journey starts when she is ten years old, and ends at the age of thirty. At the end of the novel, Jane is married and has a child aged ten. Her twenty-year-journey locates her in the three consecutive stages of moral development. Her twenty-year-journey locates her in the three consecutive stages of moral development.

Forster’s A Passage to India (1924) and Louis Bertrand’s La Cina (1901),"The main focus of this research paper is to study one of the key concepts of postcolonial critical theory which is “Identity and Representation”. It is based upon a textual reading and analysis of two texts as representatives of colonial literature written about British-India and French-Algeria, namely A Passage to India by E.M. Forster and La Cina by Louis Bertrand. Relying on Albert Memmi’s foundational postcolonial theory developed in his The Colonizer and the Colonized, we assume that both texts obey and reflect a similar ideological discourse. The narratives are revealed to operate through a complex system which tends to (re)fashion and to (re)mold the identity of both the colonizer and the colonized. We demonstrate that Forster and Bertrand shape the main characters into two types which Memmi labels as: ‘the Colonizer who Accepts’ and ‘the Colonizer who Refuses’. We have also showed that the writers though belonging to different imperial powers and writing in two different languages, they could not but adhere and support the colonial practices of their countries.  What comes also of this study is that Forster, though most often known for his Liberalism, vehicles a racial discourse which accounts for the superiority of the British colonizer. Bertrand is much more racist and jingoist, his attitudes are reminders of what Achebe said about Conrad; ‘a bloody racist’.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-04T11:30:50.198906,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:11:27.184012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/citation/,x692h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5e9994df3460019bda290/,5cf5e9994df3460019bda290,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x692h/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x692h

The main aim  of this study is to reveal various instances projecting kindness and sympathy in between the social conflict and social tension at the background of the novel “Great Expectation. The study will focus on the concept of kindness towards others which has been incorporated throughout the story of the novel between the narrator and the characters. Charles Dickens (1812- 1870) has shed light upon the theme of social mobility, manners, social injustice and prospect towards tangible reality. This study answers the question whether Dickens could be able to reflect the concept of kindness in the novel or not? Moreover, it will search whether the concept of kindness has been explored well in the story of the novel that it contains probable educational contents of kindness for research. To prove that, the article will explore various aspects of kindness, which has been observed during the course of the novel. The study would be based on qualitative research method from secondary resources. The aspect of kindness would be analyzed and highlighted through multiple scenes from the novel.

It is concluded that tragedy and the social theme are not mutually destructive in Death of a Salesman as some critics stated. Rather, they are combined to make an intense dramatic treatment of the modern American individual’s most pressing issues.

Admittedly, the Student Revolution spilled over into numerous fields. However, given space restrictions, only its cultural manifestations will be examined. It will be clear that at the root of Lodge’s students’ uprising lies an overpowering urge to break with the cultural heritage and with the academics upholding it. It will be equally clear, nonetheless, that these young activists’ faith in Marcuse’s political doctrine is unwelcome to conservative academics on the ground that it has diverse adverse effects on universities. Not only are politically oriented texts and discourses given precedence over traditional ones but also teachers and administrators are, at times, hindered from doing their duties. The plausible conclusion to draw, in the light of the research’s findings, is that although cultural revolutions undeniably pave the way for a number of personal and collective achievements and help us modernize many aspects of life, they should not blind us to the enduring significance of previous cultural traditions and of the aesthetic value of literary works.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural revolution|david lodge|herbert marcuse|proletarian|radical|the new left,2019-06-04T11:31:47.405050,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:12:26.069545,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/citation/,pfz4c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5e714d987b500188928ce/,5cf5e714d987b500188928ce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfz4c/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfz4c

The present research paper attempts to address the recurrent thematic element that postmodern fiction revolves around: that of the presence of the historiographic element in postmodern fiction which reflects in itself the evaluation of past history; such a fictional preoccupation reflects the major postmodern philosophers’ and thinkers’ concerns, such as those of Lyotard and Baudrillard, on the impossibility for the existence of a universal coherent history.

Tom’s Midnight Garden is regarded by some literary critics as a nostalgic work concerned with the past rather than the present. Its protagonist Tom is sometimes considered as disconnected from the real world and living in the fantastic. This paper will argue that, quite the contrary, Tom’s Midnight Garden stands against disconnection, between the child and the adult, the fantastic and the real, and the past and the present. Tom’s Midnight Garden celebrates connection through the interrelation between the self and the other, through a fantastic world constantly interwoven with the real, and a past tightly tied to the present.

Most accounts of campaigns’ strategic decision-makers treat them as masterminds – individuals who devise tactics based on brilliant political insight or masterful data analysis. Others assume they are mercenaries, milking the electoral process for all the money they can regardless of their own ideological commitments or what might actually help candidates win elections. Neither of these approaches is sufficient to understand how political professionals understand their work; they ignore both the fundamental uncertainty of campaign effects and the particularities of the work-world of political operatives. Drawing on 79 interviews with 67 campaign staff and consultants with high-level experience in Presidential and Senate campaigns, I argue that they should be understood as participants in a field of cultural production, which functions much like other arenas where communicative materials are crafted. Gaining esteem and coveted positions within the field is most participants’ primarily motivation, and the quality of the messages, images, and strategies they produce is judged less by measurable effects on voters than by an internally-generated set of norms and ideas about best practices.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-04T11:32:51.836895,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:23:26.663181,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/citation/,2sb9m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf57f564df3460019bd54a6/,5cf57f564df3460019bd54a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sb9m/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2sb9m

Patterns in the Public Acceptance of Protest, 1985 - 2006","A social movement society refers to a society in which protest is a standard, institutionalized feature of the political landscape. Is the U.S. steadily becoming such a society? Whereas other empirical tests of the movement society thesis have focused on political tactics and individual participation in protest, we point to the public’s attitudes as another indicator of the movement society. Using General Social Survey data, we find that the public has grown more accepting of protest with time. In addition, using indicators of social location, social engagement, and political engagement as predictors, we find that while these factors help explain support for protest, their effects vary depending on the type of protest in question. Age, education, gender, income, employment status, and political interest all affect the acceptance of public meetings and demonstrations; however, the effect of income is reversed when it comes to the acceptance of a nationwide strike. Lastly, an age-period-cohort analysis finds evidence that a period effect is greater than a cohort effect in changing attitudes over time. Taken together, these findings support the claim that broad, societal-level influences have contributed to the public acceptance of protest, which is suggestive of a social movement society. Yet while the U.S. may constitute a social movement society, it is one with clear boundaries: individuals do support protest, but only to the extent that it does not disrupt the material advantages associated with their social location.",TRUE,FALSE,age-period-cohort analysis|protest|public opinion|social movement society,2019-06-06T19:26:03.742061,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-06T19:25:34.805899,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/citation/,79k3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5644a0966240018d85fc2/,5cf5644a0966240018d85fc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/79k3u/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00380237.2019.1624233,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/79k3u
