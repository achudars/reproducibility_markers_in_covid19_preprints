Higher education is deemed to be one of the most important factors associated with upward mobility and economic stability. While the achievement gap continues to widen, children of immigrants continue to struggle to assimilate and in gaining access to the white middle-class mainstream. Ultimately, the snowball effect of intergenerational low socioeconomic status rolls over on to the disadvantage immigrant children in the new generation. I propose that children of U.S. born parents have a greater educational attainment than children of immigrants. Using the 2016 General Social Survey (N= 1,899) ¬ this study investigates the relationship between parents’ place of birth and respondents’ educational attainment. At the bivariate level, children of immigrants attain fewer years of school. However, this relationship appears to be largely mediated by parental education. After controlling for sex, race, and perceived income at age 16, it was found that respondents' educational attainment is not greatly affected by parents' birthplace but by parents’ years of education completed. Guided by insights from Bourdieu’s theory of Habitus and straight-line assimilation theory, the findings show that education plays a major role in patterns related to the assimilation theory and the acquisition of the habitus. Respondents’ educational attainment is fundamentally driven by the systematic structures in society concerning parent’s education and status.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Capital|Education|Immigration|Social capital,2018-12-21T22:56:27.623484,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T22:56:04.451470,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Skidmore College,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/citation/,e4y2v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1d242731661500197ce2a9/,5c1d242731661500197ce2a9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4y2v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4y2v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4y2v,NA

Guided by Goffman’s (1963) social stigma theory and Gagnon and Simon’s (1973) sexual script theory, I propose that 1) the more strongly the respondent agrees he or she would disrespect women who hook up frequently, the fewer times he or she reports nonconsensual sex; 2) the more strongly the respondent agrees he or she would disrespect for men who hook up frequently, the fewer times he or she reports nonconsensual sex; and 3) the more strongly the respondent agrees he or she would be less interested in someone who hooks up frequently as a boyfriend/girlfriend, the fewer times he or she reports nonconsensual sex. Using the Online College Social Life Survey data collected between 2005 and 2011, I analyze the attitudes about and reports of sexual behaviors in a non-probability sample of 16,914 students at 21 U.S. colleges and universities. Controlling for sex, age, current religion preference, and Greek affiliation, disrespect towards women who hook up frequently is positively and significantly related to fewer reports of nonconsensual sex. However, the results do not support the second and third hypotheses as there is no statistically significant relationship between disrespect towards men who hook up frequently as well as the lack of interest in people who hook up frequently and the incidents of reported nonconsensual sex.

This paper extends current approaches in segregation measurement by presenting a five-term decomposition procedure that can be used to understand more clearly why segregation has changed or differs between two comparison points. Two of the five terms account for differences in segregation that are due to the differing marginal distributions (e.g., the gender and occupational distributions), while one term accounts for differences in segregation due the different structure of segregation (what might be termed “pure” segregation). The decomposition thus presents a solution to the problem of margin-dependency, frequently discussed in the segregation literature. Finally, two terms account for the appearance or disappearance of units when analyzing change over time. The method can be further extended to attribute structural changes to individual units, which makes it possible, for instance, to quantify the effect of each occupation on changing gender segregation. The practical advantages of the decomposition are illustrated by two examples: a study of changing occupational gender segregation in the U.S, and a study of changing residential segregation in Brooklyn, New York City.",TRUE,FALSE,decomposition|gender|segregation|segregation index|theil,2018-12-21T13:01:20.955512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T12:57:35.798227,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Benjamin Elbers,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/citation/,ya7zs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q57tj/,q57tj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1cdf361ae2f400173de223/,5c1cdf361ae2f400173de223,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ya7zs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ya7zs,NA

There is growing appreciation that cultural evolutionary processes may have played an important role in this emergence of this diversity. Historical factors such as the length of time societies have had experience with centralized political governance, or how long they have employed agricultural subsistence strategies have been presented as explanatory factors that have contributed to present-day economic performance. However, it is not clear whether duration of agriculture and ancestral statehood have exerted a direct effect on modern productivity, or whether they influence economies indirectly by shaping the evolution of norms or formal institutions. Here we use structural equation modelling and a global nation-level dataset to test between hypotheses involving a range of direct and indirect pathways. We show that the historical timing of agriculture predicts the timing of the emergence of statehood, which in turn affects economic development indirectly through its effect on institutions. Ecological factors appear to affect economic performance indirectly through their historical effects on the development of agriculture and by shaping patterns of European colonization. These results support the idea that cultural evolutionary processes have been important in creating effective institutions that enable large-scale cooperation and economic growth in present-day societies.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural evolution|Economics|Human behaviour|Structural equation model,2018-12-21T13:00:09.275822,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T12:56:50.281688,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/citation/,cy4fd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gj96e/,gj96e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1cc77d1ae2f400193d8e80/,5c1cc77d1ae2f400193d8e80,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cy4fd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cy4fd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cy4fd,NA

The univariate analysis shows that most Americans do not agree with the statement that immigrants undermine American culture, and that Americans are divided on whether the number of immigrants should be increased nowadays. The multivariate result indicates that education and political views are the most significant predictors of how one views immigrants and immigration policies, correspondingly, while race, age, and religiosity have no statistically significant relationships with either dependent variable. Statistical findings support the hypothesis that the more liberal a person is, the more likely the person is to agree that immigrants do not undermine American culture and to say that the number of immigrants nowadays should be increased.

As social media continues to grow and evolve, sociologists have begun to explore its effect on an individual’s everyday life. I propose that the more social media platforms that an adolescent uses, the more they will experience negative effects on their social relationships. Using survey data from 786 respondents living in the United States, ages 13 to 17 and collected by the Pew Research Center in 2014 and 2015, regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between social media usage and its effect on quality of adolescent social relationships, controlling for sex and age. The bivariate results show a statistically significant, positive but weak association between number of social media platforms used and the social relationship experience scale. In the multivariate results, this association was still statistically significant. Additionally, the multivariate results show that the control variables, sex and age, have no significant effect on one’s social relationship experience. Therefore, these results show that the more social media platforms used, the more negative a social relationship experience an adolescent will have. The results support the hypothesis and indicate that adolescents who interact with a higher number of social media platforms will experience an increased negative effect on their social relationships. In future studies, researchers should investigate how specific social media platforms influence social relationships. Additionally, this type of research should not only continue, but should refine its methods as social media continues to quickly grow and evolve.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescents|media|social media|social relationships,2018-12-20T22:28:27.754109,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-20T22:28:07.504329,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/citation/,fjzn4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1c09ae67e1c70016851b0f/,5c1c09ae67e1c70016851b0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fjzn4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fjzn4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fjzn4,NA

Does having parents born in the United States affect pro-gun tendencies? This study proposes that being born in the United States, and having one, or both, parents born in the United States will increase pro-gun tendencies. Previous literature focuses on the importance of demographics associated with gun attitudes within the United States, but does not examine the potential relationship between the country itself and its gun culture. Using the gun control module from the 2006 General Social Survey (N = 1179), a pro-gun scale was created for the purpose of measuring pro-gun opinions. The correlation results show that those born in the United States score higher on the pro-gun scale than those born outside of the United States. However, the iterative regression shows this relationship is mediated by political views. The number of parents born in the United States does not have an effect on where the respondent lands on the pro-gun scale. The results support the notion that being born in the United States increases the likelihood of scoring higher on the pro-gun scale. It does not support the relationship between the number of parents born in the United States and the respondent’s views on gun regulation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-20T22:26:41.335110,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-20T22:26:16.265766,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/citation/,cnjpf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1be8bbe4e3b300187da6eb/,5c1be8bbe4e3b300187da6eb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnjpf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cnjpf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cnjpf,NA
