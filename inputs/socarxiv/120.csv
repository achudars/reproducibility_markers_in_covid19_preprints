The most successful estimate was termed as HALE and is provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the related website. Having established a methodology of data collection and handling the HLE can be estimated and provided to researchers and policy makers.
However, it remains an unexplored period of the last few centuries where, LE data exists along with the appropriate life tables, but not enough information for HLE estimates is collected and stored. The problem is now solved following a methodology of estimating the HLE from the life tables after the Healthy Life Years Lost (HLYL) estimation.
Our methodology on a Direct HLYL estimation from Life Tables, is tested and verified via a series of additional methods including a Weibull parameter test, a Gompertz parameter alternative and of course a comparison with HALE estimates from WHO. The complete methodology and estimation methods are published in the book on “Demography of Population Health, Aging and Health Expenditures” of Volume 50 of the Springer Series on Demographic Methods and Population Analysis.

Their persistence may be partially explained by the fact that the unequal distribution of rewards between genders is often perceived as just and legitimate. The goal of our study was to establish to what extent and under what conditions motherhood and fatherhood status affect perceptions of just inequalities. Using expectation states theories, we predicted that there would be greater acceptance of the unequal distribution of rewards between women and men with the same job experience in top-level occupations compared with bottom and mid level occupations. We also predicted that being a male or female parent would further accentuate the relationship between gender and occupational prestige, leading to acceptance of even greater income gaps between mothers and fathers. A vignette study conducted in 2017 on a representative sample of Polish respondents active in the labor force, which yielded approximately 38,000 observations, provides evidence partially conforming to our predictions. That is, willingness to tolerate differences in just earnings for men and women is higher in the high occupational status categories than in the medium and low occupational status categories. The effects of parenthood are less clear. Although the legitimized difference in earnings varies by age and parenthood status, we found rather moderate levels of motherhood penalties and much higher premiums for fatherhood, especially at the early stages of men’s careers. In addition, contrary to our predictions, mothers in high-prestige occupations were not penalized more than mothers in low and medium prestige occupations.

Such interaction often fosters cross-cultural competence (CCC), the ability to interact successfully across cultural boundaries. However most theories of cultural dynamics ignore CCC, making cultural diversity incompatible with mutually-beneficial inter-group interaction, and contributing to fears of cultural loss. Here, simple field methods at an Amazonian ethnic boundary demonstrate the prevalence of CCC. These data motivate new theory, incorporating competing developmental paths to CCC and group identity valuation, that illuminates how a common strategy of disempowered minorities can counter-intuitively sustain cultural diversity: Given strong group identity, minorities in a structurally-unequal, integrative society can maintain their distinctive cultural norms by learning those of the majority.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|Cross-cultural competence|Cultural evolution|Cultural sustainability|Ethnic identity|item-response theory|Structural inequality,2020-09-06T17:00:00.868813,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-06T16:59:50.557067,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/jabunce/Bunce-2020-xcultural-competence,no,This research was not preregistered.,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dae|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Multicultural Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/citation/,bwtvu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f54fcab9fdada00fe9f3c79/,5f54fcab9fdada00fe9f3c79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwtvu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bwtvu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bwtvu

This makes it vital to understand how these policies affect retirement decisions. In this paper, I revisit the labor supply effects of a major Australian reform that increased women’s pension age from 60 to 65. Atalay and Barrett (2015) studied these effects using repeated household surveys and a differences-in-differences design in which male cohorts form the comparison group. They estimate that the reform increased female labor force participation by 12 percentage points. Using earlier data, I show that the parallel-trends assumption did not hold before the reform because of a strong female-speciﬁc trend in participation rates across the relevant cohorts. Accounting for this trend, the estimated effect on female participation falls by two-thirds and becomes statistically insigniﬁcant at conventional levels.

An analysis of public opinions among U.S. adults,"America is unique in its celebration of nationalism in sports. U.S. athletes have also historically protested, particularly racial/ethnic inequalities, at sporting events-- especially during the national anthem ceremony. Since 2016, attention has centered on Black NFL players, and others who have been inspired by them, protesting during the anthem against unjust police violence and other racial/ethnic inequalities. These actions have prompted discussions about these issues, but also discussions about why the protests may have been inappropriate. This study, using descriptive and multiple regression analyses of data from the National Sports and Society Survey (N = 3,993), examines public opinions about this issue. Results suggest that public opinion is now more supportive of athletes being allowed to protest during the anthem; although, considerable opposition persists. Black individuals and those who recognize racial/ethnic discrimination in society are especially likely to support the right of athletes to protest. Heterosexual, Christian, sports fan, and military identities seem to encourage opposition to the right to protest. Indicators of traditionalism and sports nationalism attitudes are also negatively associated with support for athlete protests. Overall, these results help to better contextualize and understand the controversy over whether or not athletes should have the right to protest during the national anthem.",TRUE,FALSE,Athlete Protests; National Anthem; Sports Events; Race/ethnicity; 		     Nationalism,2020-09-06T03:18:21.811282,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-06T03:18:00.206636,FALSE,NA,no,"Until fully prepared for public release, data information can be obtained by contacting the first author.

Despite all differences, these indicators are commonly found to be strongly correlated, which makes the choice of indicator for a given analysis seem inconsequential. We demonstrate that the correlations between governance indicators are indeed high when comparing across countries or using pooled country-year data sets, but are surprisingly low -- sometimes even negative -- within countries. Given the increased interest of researchers in longitudinal analyses with country time series, low agreement between country time trends in the quality of governance is concerning.

Political scientists typically use the frequency of terrorist attacks as the dependent variable and test different covariates to identify factors that produce terrorism. But attacks are an imperfect measure of terrorist activity because of “plot attrition” — the tendency for plots to derail due to police intervention or other reasons. This research note assesses this potential measurement problem. Building on advances in plot data collection, we show that common research designs predicting the incidence of terrorism produce statistically significantly different results depending on whether terrorist activity is operationalized as plots or attacks. These differences are after accounting for a state’s security capabilities, suggesting that plot attrition is dynamic and not easily controlled out. The results suggest that taking plots as the outcome measure is likely to give us new insights into the causes of terrorism.",TRUE,FALSE,Attacks|Event data|Measurement|Plots|Terrorism,2020-09-04T06:05:24.699093,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-04T06:04:49.999962,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/Hegghammer/plots,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/citation/,t72yj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5161a94f1e5e000d6f16e0/,5f5161a94f1e5e000d6f16e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t72yj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t72yj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t72yj

One famous explanation is linked fate (Dawson 1994). We conceptualize two ways respondents might think about their ties to a racial group, linked hurt or linked progress. Linked hurt is when a respondent believes that when their group is hurt then they are hurt, while linked progress is when a respondent believes that when their group is helped then they are also helped. We compare the standard linked fate measure to our measures using a representative survey in California. We make three contributions. First, people interpret linked fate more expansively than expected by Black utility heuristic theory. Second, we provide two new novel measures that better capture the concept and outperform the original linked fate measure. Finally, we show that our measures better pick up between group heterogeneity than the traditional linked fate measure. We encourage scholars to use our measures instead of the traditional linked fate measure when the concept of interest is linked fate.",TRUE,FALSE,Experiment|Group consciousness|Linked fate|Measurement|Survey,2020-09-04T06:05:22.108077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-04T06:05:13.312469,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/citation/,k6c9x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f51358fae5a9500f96da3ef/,5f51358fae5a9500f96da3ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6c9x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k6c9x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k6c9x
