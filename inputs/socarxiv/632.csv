We maintain that more attention must be paid to cognitive mechanisms to move the debate ahead. Using survey data from 938 localities in Germany, France, and the Netherlands, we explore a crucial individual-level mechanism: perceptions of diversity. We not only consider perceptions of the amount, but also of the qualitative nature of diversity. By asking about various qualitative aspects of diversity, we test the cognitive salience of three explanations that have been proposed in the literature for negative diversity effects: out-group biases, asymmetric preferences and coordination problems. We show that all three mechanisms matter. Perceptions both mediate statistical diversity effects, and have important explanatory power of their own. Moreover, we are able to address the question to what extend the relationship of perceived diversity and neighborhood social cohesion varies across policy contexts. Based on assumptions in the literature about positive impacts of inclusive and culturally pluralist immigrant integration policy approaches, we hypothesize that ethno-cultural diversity is less negatively related to neighborhood social cohesion in more inclusive policy contexts. Our results provide partial support for this hypothesis as perceived diversity has a significantly stronger negative impact on neighborhood cohesion in Germany.",TRUE,FALSE,Ethnic diversity|group threat|in-group favoritism|Perceived diversity|Social Cohesion,2018-07-02T10:58:14.403253,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-30T08:43:21.033295,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/citation/,64p3z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s32e5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/relationships/node/,s32e5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592d3007b83f69026e96118d/,592d3007b83f69026e96118d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64p3z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/64p3z/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-015-0863-3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/64p3z

Unpacking Variety, Balance and In-Group Size","Ethnic diversity is typically measured by the well-known Hirschman-Herfindahl Index. This paper discusses the merits of an alternative approach, which is in our view better suited to tease out why and how ethnic diversity matters. The approach consists of two elements. First, all existing diversity indices are non-relational. From the viewpoint of theoretical accounts that attribute negative diversity effects to in-group favoritism and out-group threat, it should however matter whether, given a certain level of overall diversity, an individual belongs to a minority group or to the dominant majority. We therefore decompose diversity by distinguishing the in-group share from the diversity of ethnic out-groups. Second, we show how generalized entropy measures can be used to test which of diversity’s two basic dimensions matters most: the variety of groups, or the unequal distribution (balance) of the population over groups. These measures allow us to test different theoretical explanations against each other, because they imply different expectations regarding the effects of in-group size, out-group variety, and balance. We apply these ideas in an analysis of various social cohesion measures across 55 German localities and show that both in-group size and out-group diversity matter. For the native majority as well as for persons of immigration background, the variety component of diversity seems to be more decisive than has formerly been acknowledged. These findings provide little support for group threat and in-group favoritism as the decisive mechanisms behind negative diversity effects, and are most in line with the predictions of theories that emphasize coordination problems, asymmetric preferences, and network closure.",TRUE,FALSE,Entropy|Ethnic diversity|group threat|in-group favoritism|Social cohesion,2018-07-02T10:58:14.311869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-30T08:01:02.339295,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/citation/,6pesk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dchbj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/relationships/node/,dchbj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592d258eb83f6902709647a5/,592d258eb83f6902709647a5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6pesk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6pesk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6pesk

Why School Dropouts of Turkish Origin Earn More in Germany,"We investigate an often overlooked implication of the signaling model of statistical discrimination: if immigrant minorities' educational qualifications carry less signaling power, poorly-qualified minority members should experience positive statistical discrimination. We argue that the lower signaling power stems from disadvantages associated with insufficient language skills and lack of supportive parental resources, which prevent minority students from achieving those educational qualifications that would reflect their high motivation and ambition. Yet, if education counts less, so does its lack. Using data from the German Microcensus, we compare log hourly personal income of 1.5th and 2nd generation Spätaussiedler and persons of Turkish origin to that of native Germans. Using (semi-parametric) generalized additive models, we find solid support for our claim that poorly-qualified persons of Turkish origin experience income advantages; they frequently work in jobs for which they are underqualified. Once different frequencies of over- and undereducation are taken into account, no ethnic differences in educational returns remain.

The first half of the article argues that a sociologically sophisticated understanding of replication must take into account both the ways that replication rules and conventions evolved within an epistemic culture and how those cultures are shaped by specific research challenges. The second half outlines the four main dimensions of replicability in quantitative sociology- verifiability, robustness, repeatability, and generalizability- and discusses the specific ambiguities of interpretation that can arise in each.

This article argues that the critical evaluation risks missing how regulators’ new tools and procedures are helping them to improve the governance of financial institutions. The focus is on the most significant novelty of the post-crisis period: regulatory stress testing. Guided by 13 interviews with regulators and financial practitioners involved in the Bank of England’s stress tests, the article addresses its ‘qualitative review’ component, which informs the supervision of the UK’s largest bank holding groups. Our findings suggest that the requirement for banks to provide a narrative account of their modelling and governance practices is changing those practices and also weakening the boundaries between banks’ epistemic subcultures. We then reflect on how the pushback against the tests points to the limits of Jens Beckert’s theorisation of the politics of expectations and requires scholars to evaluate judiciously post-crisis regulatory reforms.",TRUE,FALSE,central banks|epistemic culture|fictional expectations|financial regulation|risk modelling|stress testing,2018-07-02T10:58:13.630303,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T14:27:21.091644,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Nathan Coombs and John Morris,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/citation/,jzt4m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nwsjk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/relationships/node/,nwsjk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c2ee6594d9000441b9a84/,592c2ee6594d9000441b9a84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jzt4m/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jzt4m

Excavated in the 1980s and 90s, it has been interpreted as an area specializing in ceramics production. This study of this area takes place in the context of an ongoing, broader project focused on the ancient town of Mandeure-Mathay (Epomanduodurum) and its surroundings, currently conducted within the framework of a PCR (collective research project). To undertake a more detailed study of the Essarté area fieldwalking surveys were carried out in 2006 and a synthesis of previous excavations, based on the available documentation, was completed in 2009. Geophysical surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2010. In addition, a LiDAR survey of Mandeure-Mathay and its surroundings realized in 2009 included the Essarté area. This paper contextualizes the data provided by excavations and aerial surveys carried in the 1980s and 90s by integrating it with the data obtained through the magnetometry survey – providing additional information on sub-surface features - and the data obtained through fieldwalking and LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) surveys - used to characterize the micro-topography of the terrain surface and associated materials in detail.

Advances in cognitive neurosciences and a suite of improved computational modeling tools, combined with the proliferation of detailed 3D models of archaeological complexes and landscapes, offer an opportunity for new approaches to these topics based on models of low level perceptual cues and visual attention. The approach described here takes aim at the question of where people will look, rather than simply what is visible, with the goal of investigating the intentions of designers of spaces, and visual aspects of the experience of a place. In simple terms, our approach involves placing detailed 3D models of built spaces or landscapes into a digital environment. An individual then virtually walks through the space and what is visible at each moment is recorded in the form of a video stream, which may be broken down into a sequence of scenes. This set of scenes is then analyzed using software that calculates and maps the visual saliency of each scene and the path of focuses of attention (FOA) over time. This set of saliency maps, raw images, and FOA paths provide the basis for further interpretation. This paper presents an initial experiment to illustrate the approach, carried out in the eastern passage at Knowth, one of the main mounds in the Brú na Bóinne in Ireland.",TRUE,FALSE,3D|archaeological method|archaeology|Visual attention,2018-07-02T10:58:13.505556,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T12:52:20.107134,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/citation/,73rt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/svdn2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/relationships/node/,svdn2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c18ca594d9000461ba66e/,592c18ca594d9000461ba66e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/73rt5/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-016-9310-2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/73rt5
