The final authenticated version is available online at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-01033-8 or https://rdcu.be/b6avX.] Like previous educational technologies, artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) threatens to disrupt the status quo, with proponents highlighting the potential for efficiency and democratization, and skeptics warning of industrialization and alienation. However, unlike frequently discussed applications of AI in autonomous vehicles, military and cybersecurity concerns, and healthcare, AI’s impacts on education policy and practice have not yet captured the public attention. This paper therefore evaluates the status of AIEd, with special attention to intelligent tutoring systems and anthropomorphized artificial educational agents. I discuss AIEd’s purported capacities, including the abilities to simulate teachers, provide robust student differentiation, and even foster socioemotional engagement. Next, in order to situate developmental pathways for AIEd going forward, I contrast sociotechnical possibilities and risks through two idealized futures. Finally, I consider a recent proposal to use peer review as a gatekeeping strategy to prevent harmful research. This proposal serves as a jumping off point for recommendations to AIEd stakeholders towards improving their engagement with socially responsible research and implementation of AI in educational systems.",TRUE,FALSE,artificial intelligence|educational agents|education technology|responsible research and innovation|social implications of technology,2020-08-06T13:30:46.238198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-06T13:22:01.468048,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/citation/,uqvzd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2aee8e5f705a02d9619b79/,5f2aee8e5f705a02d9619b79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uqvzd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uqvzd/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-01033-8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uqvzd

Instead, research should focus on the commonalities of all interpreting practice. This move is viewed as an enabling shift for the creation of Comparative Interpreting Studies, a strand dedicated to considering interpreting as a global practice. After discussing the rationale for the current use of interpreting settings as analytical categories, evidence from a variety of existing settings is used to illustrate the commonalities between all instances of interpreting and the fuzziness of the boundaries between these settings. It is argued that using interpreting settings leads to silo thinking, where researchers focus on research in the setting in which they are working, even when findings from other settings can be applied.

One topic they struggle is when they face chemistry formulation for the first time. The concept of oxidation number is difficult for them. The level of abstraction required is still developing in their minds. We must help them visualise it, to understand bonding and, finally, the symbolic representation of chemical compounds.
We find in chemistry a visual description for bond formation: Lewis diagrams. They explicitly show molecular bonds as paired electrons. By using this simple idea, we can introduce formulation to secondary school students. Starting with binary chemical compounds, included in 3rd year of secondary schools in Spain, we can set up the foundations for their future chemistry studies. Of course, the difficulty must be progressively introduced.
In this work, we show how a visual method based on Lewis diagrams improves the performance of students when writing formulae of binary chemical compounds. One important difference with current literature on how Lewis dot structures are used in education, is that, while they are usually presented as a learning goal, here we use them as a means to an end.
Our results suggest that the improvement is higher for students with previous lower academic performance, low scores in linguistic competencies, and high scores in visual and artistic competencies. Most importantly, it does not worsen performance for students with high scores in linguistic competencies and low scores in visual and artistic competencies. Mathematical competencies do not seem to be so good predictors for students’ performance.

How specifically do Indian and Chinese diets have changed and middle-class consumption and evaluate their dietary trend? 
Methodology: The paper analyses the diet patter of India and China from 1990 to 2019. The paper is particularly keen to analyse the impact of income, urbanization and proportion of the young population on diet pattern. The data of food balance for these two countries is taken from FAOSTAT. To measure the income effect, the GNP per capita data is taken from World Bank. The population and urbanization data is taken from UN world population prospects 2019 and UN world urbanization prospects 2018. The linear regression model is used to analyse the impact of socio-economic factors. 
Results: The analysis has found that rise in income is positively associated with the macronutrients diet for Indians particularly for carbohydrates consumption whereas for Chinese the reverse is true. The study found that urbanization of the population is highly positively associated with the consumption of carbohydrates diet for Chinese whereas, for India, urbanization is negatively associated with fat consumption. The change in young age population negatively impacts the fat consumption for China while positively impact the consumption of carbohydrates for Indians.
Conclusion: The gap between dietary pattern is found to be reduced globally. Consumption of many food groups shows convergence for a different region. The consumption of macronutrients between India and China from 1990 to 2019 shows the converging trend in the early 1990s but after that, it shows divergence.

Forensic authorities use narratives to trace events surrounding these deaths both in a search for meaning and a desire to prevent them. We examine these narratives, drawing on summaries from over 300,000 violent deaths in the U.S.  Our goal is to capture the latent themes and other semantic structures that undergird violent death and its surveillance. To do so, we introduce a flexible model for the analysis of topics (""discourse atoms''), where locations in a semantic embedding space map onto distributions over words. We use this model to extract a high-level, thematic description of discourses of violent death.  We identify 225 topics, discussing several in detail including topics about drug paraphernalia, financial difficulties, erratic and impaired behavior, and uncertainty.  Our results offer clues into themes surrounding violent death and its administrative surveillance, and our method offers a new way to computationally model discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|death|embeddings|homicide|narrative|suicide|text analysis|topic modeling|violence|word embeddings,2020-08-04T13:11:00.973780,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-04T13:09:04.162790,FALSE,NA,no,Access data from the NVDRS directly: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nvdrs/datapublications.html,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/citation/,nkyaq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2878cc5f705a01f461899c/,5f2878cc5f705a01f461899c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nkyaq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nkyaq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nkyaq

Strong  board  governance  provides  both  of  those  conditions.  Most  university  boards,  especially  the  public  ones,  were created by charters or statutes that placed the board fully in charge, and, remarkably, the boards legally retain much of their power. And yet, because of a variety of pressures and  distortion,  most  boards  have  relinquished  their  rightful  positions  atop  college  and  university governance.This  report  is  intended  to  operate  on  two  levels.  One  is  to  make  the  case  for  stronger  board control. Such a hierarchical system, rather than the distributed shared governance system  that  exists  now,  is  necessary  to  effect  large-scale  reform.  Shared  governance  is  a  sacred cow that needs to be gored.The report also works on a more immediate, pragmatic level, providing many solutions that can be implemented individually to begin the process of reforming governance. In most situations, boards still have extensive legal authority. They merely need to exercise their existing authority to put the brakes on many of academia’s excesses.
