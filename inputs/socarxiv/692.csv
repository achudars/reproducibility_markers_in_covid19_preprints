This thesis provides a cultural history of Australian copyright law and related artistic controversies. It examines a number of disputes over authorship, collaboration, and appropriation across a variety of cultural fields. It considers legal controversies over the plagiarism of texts, the defacing of paintings, the sampling of musical works, the ownership of plays, the co-operation between film-makers, the sharing of MP3 files on the Internet, and the appropriation of Indigenous culture. Such narratives and stories relate to a broad range of works and subject matter that are protected by copyright law.
This study offers an archive of oral histories and narratives of artistic creators about copyright law. It is founded upon interviews with creative artists and activists who have been involved in copyright litigation and policy disputes. This dialogical research provides an insight into the material and social effects of copyright law.
This thesis concludes that copyright law is not just a ‘creature of statute’, but it is also a social and imaginative construct. In the lived experience of the law, questions of aesthetics and ethics are extremely important. Industry agreements are quite influential. Contracts play an important part in the operation of copyright law. The media profile of personalities involved in litigation and policy debates is pertinent. This thesis claims that copyright law can be explained by a mix of social factors such as ethical standards, legal regulations, market forces, and computer code. It can also be understood in terms of the personal stories and narratives that people tell about litigation and copyright law reform.

Though theincidence is low (3-10,000), the prevalence is high due to chronicity. Schizophrenia is occurring in both developingand developed countries.The remission rate is higher in developing countries compared to the developedones. There are some compelling factors that may influence the outcome ofschizophrenia includes gender, employment, marital status, family support,illness myths, family burden, duration of untreated psychosis etc. In this review we have discussed the epidemiology,pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment and finally the factors that influencethe outcome of schizophrenia in developing and developed countries.

If law is a reasoned enterprise, how is it that we are neither torn apart nor homogenized by our long social practice of it? I resolve this puzzle, and arrive at a richer understanding of law, using the idea of modeling familiar from the natural sciences and mathematics. I show (a) that theorists can model legal systems as abstract systems of institutions, information flows, and institutional processing or reasoning and (b) that the participants in a legal system themselves maintain and evaluate models of this sort. Un- derstanding law this way clarifies numerous problems ranging from pluralism to legal interpretation. This work emphasizes four major points of the theory:
(1) It identifies law as the conceptual side of cooperation and, thus, the
means of coordinating decisionmaking.
(2) It derives from human cooperation a picture of legal systems as a net-
work of institutions exchanging information and maintaining their own
rules of recognition and decision.
(3) It advances the thesis that cooperation and its associated legal system
arise when individuals create institution-information models, identify
the models used by others, and accept the use of those models.
(4) Finally, it provides a standard representation of institutions, their com- munications, and their reasoning. This analysis reveals that institutional
agreement and disagreement occur at discrete levels.
Together, these elements yield a theory of legal systems that grounds
jurisprudence in the study of the human conceptual system. It sheds new light on the problem of theoretical disagreement, otherwise puzzling problems of pluralism, and the connection between law and morality.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|Socarxiv|SocArXiv,2018-07-02T10:51:49.821781,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-05T17:12:36.655000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c58|Law|Law and Philosophy|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c62|Law|Jurisprudence|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Christian Turner,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/citation/,q8kuh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yj8e3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/relationships/node/,yj8e3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57cda6a36c613b01ddf03648/,57cda6a36c613b01ddf03648,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8kuh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q8kuh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q8kuh

attention on two doctrines that provide immunity from antitrust liability
for certain anticompetitive activity: the state action doctrine and the
petitioning immunity doctrine (sometimes known as the Noerr-Pennington
doctrine, after the two cases that established it). These doctrines have
been the subject of seven Supreme Court decisions in as many years. In
spite of (or perhaps because of) the Court’s numerous recent decisions,
there remains a great deal of confusion about the source and the scope of
these doctrines. This Article attempts to clarify both doctrines.

The Supreme Court and a number of commentators contend that the antitrust
immunity doctrines are the product of statutory interpretation of the
antitrust laws themselves. The Court contends that petitioning and state
action are “essentially dissimilar” to the types of business activity the
antitrust laws were designed to regulate. This Article disagrees. Both
petitioning and state action present precisely the sorts of problems with
which the antitrust laws are concerned — exploitation of consumers through
the charging of supracompetitive prices.

To determine the source of antitrust immunity, the Court must look beyond
the antitrust laws to the constitutional principles that are implicated by
the doctrines. For the state action doctrine, the constitutional principle
at stake is largely one of federalism, and the more general democratic
principles embodied in the Court’s non-delegation jurisprudence. For the
petitioning immunity doctrine, the First Amendment protection of speech and
petitioning provides the relevant principles. After examining the source of
the antitrust immunity doctrines, this Article considers the appropriate
scope of those doctrines in light of the constitutional principles at issue.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:33.042559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-02T23:01:23.752000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/citation/,9fc3a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9u63f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/relationships/node/,9u63f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57ca04c76c613b01eb24a903/,57ca04c76c613b01eb24a903,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fc3a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9fc3a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9fc3a

computer software has shifted from copyright to patent. We argue that one
unanticipated effect of this trend may be to encourage software reuse.
Traditionally, computer programmers have reinvented software components,
coding programs from scratch each time a new one is desired rather than
buying and reusing existing components. This process is inefficient, and is
in stark contrast to the normal practice in other engineering disciplines.
We argue that copyright law encourages reinvention and discourages the
development of a market for tradeable software components because it allows
competitors to appropriate the value of a new software invention without
payment to the original developer of that invention, but forbids
competitors from copying the computer code implementing that invention. The
result is that competitors take inventions from others, but write their own
code to implement those inventions. By contrast, patent law gives strong
protection to inventions, forcing competitors to license the patent in
order to make any product incorporating the idea. It is reasonable to
expect that one effect of increasing reliance on patent law will be an
increase in licenses of both the patented idea and the implementing code.
This licensing should in turn pave the way for the trading and reuse of

The patent misuse doctrine is an equitable remedy analogous to the “unclean
hands” doctrine in tort law. It bars infringement suits by patentees who
have “misused” their patent grant, either by using the patent to violate
the antitrust laws or by extending their patent monopoly in some other way.
The author first describes the nature and scope of antitrust protection in
the patent area, and contrasts the antitrust laws with the patent misuse
doctrine. Next, the author argues that the patent misuse doctrine is
irrational from an economic standpoint for three reasons: the level of
sanction is unrelated to the injury caused; the sanction duplicates
antitrust remedies, leading to excessive recoveries; and the sanction is
awarded as a windfall to the patent infringer even if that party was not
injured by the misuse. These effects combine to make the patent misuse
doctrine indefensible from the standpoint either of proportionality or of
deterrence. Finally, the author reviews recent legislative efforts to
reform the patent misuse doctrine and argues that they are misguided
because they fail to deal with the fundamental problems described herein.
The author concludes that the patent misuse doctrine ought to be abolished,
and that the antitrust laws can serve the same purposes that the patent
misuse doctrine was designed to serve.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:11.427494,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-02T20:38:43.053000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/citation/,tyf6h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fxss8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/relationships/node/,fxss8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c9e3576c613b01eaedbadb/,57c9e3576c613b01eaedbadb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tyf6h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tyf6h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tyf6h
