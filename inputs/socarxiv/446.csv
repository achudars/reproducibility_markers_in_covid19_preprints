We propose for this purpose a method which quantifies associations between categorical variables when we compare groups which differ only in the distribution of a mediating variable such as education. This is analogous to estimation of indirect effects in causal mediation analysis, but is here developed to define and estimate population associations of variables. We propose estimators for these associations, which depend only on fitted values from models for the mediator and outcome variables, and variance estimators for them.

A review of the literature,"This contribution reviews the literature on the role of financial aid in enhancing university participation. This aim will be reached through three main steps. First, we describe a theoretical framework based on rational action theory that could explain the effects exerted by the different measures. Second, we analyse the main forms of financial aid developed by the policy makers in Europe and in the US. More precisely, we look at the role played by: grants, tuition fees, loans and a novel approach in the financial aid debate: asset building.

Computational thinking describes a specific way of reasoning building on concepts and processes derived from algorithms and programming. One way to teach these concepts is games as an effective and efficient alternative. This article presents SplashCode, a low-cost board game to reinforce basic algorithms and programming concepts. The game was developed in a systematic way following an instructional design process, and applied and evaluated in a Brazilian public school with a total of 65 students (grade 5 to 9). First results indicate that the game can have a positive impact on motivation, learning experience, and students’ learning, as well as contribute positively to social interaction, relevance, and fun. Results of this study may assist in the selection of games as an instructional strategy and/or in the development of new games for teaching computational thinking.

First, the presence of women in formal politics has increased, albeit unevenly across parties and minority groups over time. Simultaneously, the capacity to study ‘political women’ has become supported through institutional mechanisms such as academic journals and communities of practice. Moreover, gender as a critical focus of analysis has been developed and refined. In the literature on women and politics, the shift from studying sex differences to interrogating gendered political institutions is especially salient. This institutional focus, along with recent intersectional studies of gender and politics, increases opportunities for cross-pollination of sociological and political science perspectives. In this review, I provide a brief history of the U.S. scholarship on gender and politics and map these relevant social, institutional, and theoretical advances.

This study focuses on the content of Twitter messages related to the 2016 terrorist attack on the Berlin Christmas market. We complement the collective sense-making perspective with the terror management theory (TMT) perspective to understand why people used Twitter in the aftermath of the attack. We use structural topic modeling to analyze our dataset of 51,000 tweets. Our results indicate that people used Twitter to make sense of the events and as part of typical reactions in TMT, that is, to validate their own worldviews and maintain their self-esteem. In accordance with TMT, we found that people used Twitter to search for meaning and value, show sympathy for victims and their families, or call for tolerance, but also to express nationalistic sentiment and greater hostility toward values and views other than their own. We further show that topics varied over the course of the attack and in the days that followed. Whereas in the first two days there were many emotion-related tweets and operational updates, subsequent days saw more opinion-related tweets.

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) has provided researchers with a vast trove of machine-readable data allowing for highly detailed spatio-temporal modelling of scheduled transit operations.
Yet it is well established that in the real-world schedules are imperfect - vehicles often run late, get bunched, miss transfers, arrive too full for anyone to board, and otherwise behave in predictably unpredictable ways. 
Schedule data alone cannot possibly account for this distinctly stochastic component of much transit service, which to date has been considered separate from accessibility analysis under the umbrella of ``reliability''. 
This dissertation takes the perspective that transit service is reliably unreliable and will continue to be so until humans are taken out of the equation. Detailed observations of actual service can be used to construct more realistic models for estimating travel times and thus accessibility via transit.
		
Chapter 2 introduces a novel method of converting a detailed GPS record of transit fleet locations into a retrospective GTFS package. This backward-looking ""schedule'' format allows the same tools developed for schedule-based GTFS analysis to be applied in Chapter 3 to a more accurate depiction of actual transit accessibility. The findings indicate that models of transit accessibility based on schedule data alone tend to produce substantial overestimates of accessibility and systematic spatial errors by failing to account for normal irregularities in service provision. Chapter 4 points toward a way of better suiting available GTFS analysis tools to actual transit service by addressing the problem of imperfect information in modelled route choice. The travel time implications for a large minority of trips are shown to be substantial. 
		
Transit accessibility research has come a long way in the last decade and has a long way yet to go.

The existing research to develop inclusive STEM education adopts a deficit approach and fails to address the intersectionality of gender, race and class. By not addressing this intersectionality, research has failed to consider the effects of racial privilege for white women and the unique experiences of each woman of color. In contrast, my research will take an anti- deficit approach and value the intersectionality of each student. The objective of this study is to examine the experiences of WSOC in their secondary STEM education according to the intersection of race, gender and class. This research is also guided by the following questions: (1) What are WSOC’s social and academic experiences of STEM-related courses, and in-class and extracurricular activities? (2) What support systems and barriers do WSOC recognize in their schools pertaining to STEM, if any? (3) How are their experience, support systems and barriers unique yet similar according to their intersectionality? This paper develops the theoretical approach that guides my research. To better understand how WSOC are racialized and gendered in the settler state, I adopt Critical Race Theory (CRT) approach. In the education setting, it describes how schools, as a state funded institute, act as a site of reinforcement of this oppression. I also incorporate post- structualist work on identity and power to refine how WSOC are situated in the STEM education setting. The research will adopt the Counter-Storytelling as a methodology which emphasizes the importance of telling the stories of people, whose experiences are not often told to expose, analyze and challenge the majoritarian stories of racial privilege.",TRUE,FALSE,Inclusive Education|Intersectionality|STEM|Women of Color,2019-05-07T19:49:50.407949,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-07T12:55:24.664981,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,Kelly Kim,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/citation/,tj4yk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd16eb396b9d1001ba19335/,5cd16eb396b9d1001ba19335,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj4yk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tj4yk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tj4yk,NA

The collaboration was directed by Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia and would eventually involve over 250 co-authors. According to the collaboration, reproducibility was one of, if not the single most defining feature of the social endeavor known as ""science."" ""Other types of belief,"" the authors write, ""depend on the authority and motivations of the source; beliefs in science do not."" The ability to reproduce scientific results across time and space -- the ability to have results be independentof the individuals involved -- is what the authors argued makes science science. And yet the eventual findings of the reproducibility project showed a remarkable reproductive failure. Over half of all studies failed to indicate similar effects upon replication. The very value upon which science was supposed to be founded appeared to be an exception rather than a norm.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-07T19:49:27.270279,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-07T12:54:51.402891,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/citation/,dzj5n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd16599195bee0018bc0095/,5cd16599195bee0018bc0095,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzj5n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dzj5n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dzj5n,NA

Can protests also continue to shape a nation’s contemporary politics outside of more formalized channels? I argue that social movements can not only beget institutional change, but also long-run, attitudinal change. Using the case of the U.S. civil rights movement, I develop a theory in which protests can shift attitudes and these attitudes can persist. Data from over 150,000 survey respondents provide evidence consistent with the theory. Whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against blacks. These individual-level results are politically meaningful—counties that experienced civil rights protests are associated with greater Democratic Party vote shares even today. This study highlights how social movements can have persistent impacts on a nation’s politics.",TRUE,FALSE,protests|public opinion|race|social movements,2019-05-07T18:10:03.533755,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-06T15:27:11.384466,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/citation/,uvm2a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd0506510339000189c47c0/,5cd0506510339000189c47c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvm2a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uvm2a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uvm2a,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WKJJ3Z
