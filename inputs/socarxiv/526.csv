The development of postcolonial theory will be introduced with special consideration to Said’s (1995) theory of Orientalism and Spivak’s (1988) concept of “silencing the Others.” Sample Western literary texts will show a concerted expression of colonial ideology supporting the concept of binary divisions. These will include The Tempest by William Shakespeare (1990), Robinson Crouse by Daniel Defoe (1899), Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte (2001), and Passage to India by E. M. Foster (1985).

In all of her works, Kincaid focuses greatly on the influence of the colonial project from which her nation suffered greatly in the past. This paper offers a postcolonial reading of the novel Lucy (1999).  The novel details the life of a girl who left her homeland, Antigua, and went to the United States to work as an au pair for a white family. The paper focuses on the author’s as well as the main character Lucy's anger at everything that reminded them of the colonizers, their homeland and family. This anger is seen as a form of hate traced in Lucy's reaction towards the educational system created by the colonizers, her homeland, and any authoritative figure. Lucy suggests that the educational system, which follows the British teachings, in Antigua asserts the domination of the colonizers and the humiliation of her nation. She hates her homeland because she considers it as a production made by the colonizers. Fleeing to the United States is a way to escape her past. Her hate of any kind of domination or control practiced on her is seen in her bad relationship with her mother and employer. Struggling to overcome her anger throughout the novel, Lucy discovers that the aftermaths of her nation colonial past formulates her present and points to her future.",TRUE,FALSE,Antigua|Caribbean literature|colonial past|humiliation of the colonized|imperial domination|Lucy,2019-07-25T18:38:04.113393,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:37:47.126637,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/citation/,5yz3h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/awqhk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/relationships/node/,awqhk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbc6239764d2001c5933d4/,5bdbc6239764d2001c5933d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yz3h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5yz3h/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5yz3h

The research design used is an action research where an action plan was carried out with year 1 translation students and the instruments used are pre and posttests as well as formative assessment sheets. The group of students were introduced to corpora and their applications in translation, and taught how to use the online Corpus of Contemporary American English to solve translational problems of collocations and phrasal verbs.

In these classes teachers inculcate knowledge through spoon feeding practices rather than innovative ones that may challenge students' thoughts and abilities by facing them with non-traditional events, activities or scenes. In spite of the fact that Muslim teachers recite many verses from the Holy Quran daily, they are unaware of the pedagogical and psychological implements in the verses they have been reciting.  Hence, this study aims at identifying the pedagogical and the psychological implements in the holly Quran, specifically Surah Alkhaf. To collect data, content analysis method was used to elicit the pedagogical and the psychological implements. To identify the context in which these implements appear, the Key Word In Context (KWIC) was used depending on Al Islam website. These implements are hoped to reshape the way of teaching and learning practiced by many teachers and learners at educational institutions. In most cases, EFL learners don't actively use their minds or the critical skills that may trigger solutions to problems they encounter continuously. This study emphasizes the disastrous consequences of jumping to conclusions before one analyzes and interprets any ambiguous phenomenon. Results of the study showed many pedagogical and psychological implements such as motivation for learning, learning contracts, contradicted practices, stimulus-response model, accommodation and equilibration. The study implicates that any process of learning should be fueled by internal motivation that sparks the learner's power. Learners shouldn't be hasty and jump to conclusions, instead they should do their best to critically analyze events so that they can solve dilemmas they face daily. Another significant implication is the use of learning contracts to enhance fruitful learning.

Paule Marshall’s first novel Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959), focuses on Selina Boyce, a second-generation Barbadian immigrant from the United States, whose search for her roots is informed by an inherent link to the Caribbean through an articulation of the dynamics of belonging. The notion of ‘home’ as a contradictory and contested trope is vital, for the writer’s foremost concern is on the overarching effect it has on the diasporic subject. Marshall grants her protagonist the space to challenge familial struggles, and reclaim her voice by re-locating to Barbados, her parental home. The protagonist’s enigmatic journey through ambivalent interspaces enables her to reconstruct bridges to the West Indies.

It calls for a practice-based research model to materialize the mechanisms needed for the interaction and collaboration of the three stakeholders, which would have positive impacts on the translation landscape. Given that this cross-fertilization can only be beneficial if it is structured and sustained, then it has to be formalized and institutionalized. A plan will be proposed as to how this can be materialized.  It is a thesis of this paper that professional practice needs academic research (theories) to shape it, and theory can only have functional dimensions through professional practice; therefore, there is a pressing need to bridge the gap between “knowing” and “doing” in translation.

The current study, however, illustrates the pervasive syntactic asymmetries in the syntactic output of the translated Quranic text into English. Most translators shift from the word order in Arabic to word order in English to establish a grammatical equivalence between the source text (ST) and the target text (TT) with little consideration of the syntactic typological significance of Arabic as a source language and English as a target one. This study aims to determine the mismatch of the grammatical functions and the syntactic typology of TL vis-à-vis ST. Word order, tense shift, case asymmetry, Ellipsis, passive structures, selectional restrictions and cross formations are some of the grammatical issues that illustrate the syntactic asymmetries in the English translation adopted in this paper. The findings show that different grammatical categories exhibit syntactic asymmetries that would distort the implications or exegesis of the original ST.

The article is grounded in cultural linguistics, which is a composite framework from cognitive linguistics, Boasian linguistics, ethnosemantics, and the ethnography of speaking. It has adopted a cultural linguistic approach to proverbial discourse. For that reason, possible specific scenes for the generic scenes of the analyzed proverbs are spelled out by proverbial discourses throughout the article. The findings show that proverbs work in the sociocultural environment as proverbial discourse, necessitating a specific scene onto which a generic scene is mapped.

The study was discourse-based as it adopted the main premise of the Information Processing approach to SI (Hodzik &amp; Williams 2017, p. 2) which considers interpreting a language-dependent activity. The data consisted of a sample of the aforementioned trainees’ recorded interpretations of a video lecture on solar energy. The data analysis was based on Barik’s (1975, 2002) model of omission, addition and phrasing changes. The results show that the most frequent errors made and/or strategies used by the study subjects are delay omission and comprehension omission. This paper also presents a discourse-based module for SI training. The module is based on the premise that SI comprises an analysis of the comprehension phase of the source speech and the production phase of source speech messages in the target language. The material utilizes the main tenets of Setton’s (1993, 1998, 2002) model of comprehension and production and Seleskovitch’s (2008) model of teaching interpreting. This study thus sought to integrate research on SI into classroom practices.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-25T18:33:22.045338,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:33:13.637854,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/citation/,58g7v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zy3d5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/relationships/node/,zy3d5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbbbde9764d200195a2d4b/,5bdbbbde9764d200195a2d4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58g7v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58g7v/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58g7v

It is obvious that their construction would have been costly in terms of energy, but it is not clear how they would have enhanced reproductive success. In the late 1980s, the prominent US archaeologist Robert Dunnell proposed a solution to this conundrum. He argued that wasting energy on monuments and other forms of what he dubbed “cultural elaboration” would have conferred a selective advantage in highly variable environments. In the present paper, we report a study in which we used an agent-based model to test the core prediction of Dunnell’s hypothesis. In the model, the agents inherited a propensity to waste and were subjected to selection in low and high variability environments. The results we obtained do not support the hypothesis. We found that the propensity to waste was subject to strong negative selection regardless of the level of environmental variability. At the start of the simulation runs, agents wasted 50% of the time on average, but selection drove that rate down by more than a third after the first generation, ultimately settling at 5-7% on average. We contend that this casts serious doubt on the ability of Dunnell’s hypothesis to explain instances of cultural elaboration in the archaeological record.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|Agent-based  modelling|Cultural elaboration|Environmental variability|Evolutionary archaeology|Monuments|Robert Dunnell|Waste hypothesis,2018-11-02T17:14:01.355043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-02T17:13:42.413355,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,W.
