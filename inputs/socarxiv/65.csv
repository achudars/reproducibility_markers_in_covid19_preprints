Such relations can be described as fleeting encounters between complete strangers, while others – as in the case of ‘nodding’ relationships – are durable and have yet to be conceptualised. The notion of ‘invisible ties’ is proposed as a conceptual handle for studying typical urban relations that complement the established notions of strong and weak ties. Through an empirical study of four residential buildings in Geneva (Switzerland), these ‘invisible ties’ are revealed by means of a systemic approach to social urban life, from which two key actors emerge: ‘socialisers’ and ‘figures’.

At the same time, affirmative action policies are controversial and legally fraught. The Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative action should help a minoritized group achieve a critical mass of representation. While the idea of critical mass is frequently invoked in law and in policy, the term remains ill-defined and hence difficult to operationalize. Motivated by these challenges, we build a mathematical model to forecast undergraduate student body racial/ethnic demographics on public university campuses. Our model takes the form of a Markov chain that tracks students through application, admission, matriculation, retention, and graduation. Using publicly available data, we calibrate our model for two different campuses within the University of California system, test it for accuracy, and make a 10-year prediction. We also propose a definition of critical mass and use our model to assess progress towards it at the University of California-Berkeley. If no policy changes are made over the next decade, we predict that the Latinx population on campus will move towards critical mass but not achieve it, and that the Black student population will decrease, moving further below critical mass. Because affirmative action is banned in California and in nine other states, it is worthwhile to consider alternative policies for diversifying a campus, including targeted recruitment and retention efforts. Our modeling framework provides a setting in which to test the efficacy of affirmative action and of these alternative policies.",TRUE,FALSE,affirmative action|Asian American|Black|college|critical mass|ethnicity|higher education|Latinx|markov chain|mathematical model|race|university|White,2020-12-01T06:20:00.753011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-01T06:19:39.384060,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Daniel P.

Implementation of HEA in the field shows a dysfunction. The analyzes reveal a part of methodological subjectivity, the weight of opinion leaders, acting as development brokers and the absence of a complaints committee, an extremely cumbersome mechanism that is unrealistic to initiate. While HEA is seen by communities as a breakthrough, the current trend for practitioners to fill in the gaps is towards increasing the complexity of targeting methods.

the spread of the virus. In France, these measures were applied between March 17 and May 10. Using
high-quality population census data and focusing on co-residence structures on French territory, this
article analyses how co-residence patterns unevenly put different socio-demographic groups at risk of
being infected and dying from COVID-19. The research ambition is to quantify the possible impact
of co-residence structures heterogeneity on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality stemming from
within-household transmission of the virus. Using a simulation approach, the article highlights the
existence of theoretical pronounced inequalities of vulnerability to COVID-19 related to cohabitation
structures as well as a reversal of the social gradient of vulnerability when the age of the infected
person increases. Among young age categories, infection is simulated to lead to more deaths in the
less educated or foreign-born populations. Among the older ones, the inverse holds with infections
having a greater potential to provoke deaths through the transmission of the virus within households
headed by a highly educated or a native-born person. Demographic patterns such as the cohabitation
of multiple generations and the survival of both partners of a couple help to explain these results.
Even though inter-generational co-residence and large households are more common among the lower
educated and foreign born in general, the higher educated are more likely to still live with their

The seminal work by economist Bruce Davidson, ‘Australia Wet or Dry?’ in the mid-twentieth century critically examined the public money invested in large-scale irrigated agriculture in the north of the continent, and indirectly critiqued irrigation schemes in the Murray Darling Basin. Davidson coined the term ‘the Northern Myth’ to describe a widely held belief in the ability of Northern Australia to accommodate vastly expanded irrigated agricultural operations because of abundant water and land. This paper examines the current policy promoting northern development, including proposed significant extensions to dams and other water supply projects in Northern Australia. It places the latest push for northern water development in the broader historical context of Australian water resource management, finding continual reiteration of ideas that engineers can ‘create water’ and find technical ‘solutions’ to overcome the limitations of a ‘drought-ridden continent’. We argue future policy directions in Northern Australia must draw on the lessons of past water resource policy with respect to two crucial aspects: redressing the historical and current exclusion of Aboriginal peoples’ rights to water, and the embedding of environmental values in strategic water planning.",TRUE,FALSE,environmental law|environmental protection|indigenous rights|water law|water managament,2020-11-30T05:23:41.565534,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:23:19.065693,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law,Environmental and Planning Law Journal,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/citation/,3pa7z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc2ee99a72563034f834690/,5fc2ee99a72563034f834690,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pa7z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pa7z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pa7z,NA

Generalizing from the experiments conducted during a period of persistent crisis may be challenging due to changes in who participates in online survey research and how the participants respond to treatments. We investigate the generalizability of COVID-era survey experiments with 33 replications of 12 pre-pandemic designs fielded across 13 surveys on American survey respondents obtained from Lucid between March and July of 2020. We find strong evidence that these experiments replicate in terms of sign and significance, but at somewhat reduced magnitudes that are possibly explained by increased inattentiveness. These findings mitigate concerns about the generalizability of online research during this period. The pandemic does not appear to have fundamentally changed how subjects respond to treatments, provided they pay attention to treatments and outcome questions. In this light, we offer some suggestions for renewed care in the design, analysis, and interpretation of experiments conducted during the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,causal effects|covid-19|experiment|external validity|generalizability|meta-analysis|online experiments|pandemic|replication|survey experiments,2020-11-30T05:23:01.842812,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30T05:22:34.600032,FALSE,NA,no,"The replication archive will be created upon publication, pursuant to journal guidelines.",,no,Experiments in manuscript are replications from previously published papers.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Experimental Analysis of Behavior|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/citation/,s45yg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc2a29cc623190358d83509/,5fc2a29cc623190358d83509,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s45yg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s45yg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s45yg,NA
