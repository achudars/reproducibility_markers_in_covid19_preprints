This paper employs two-way fixed effects panel regressions with instrumental variables to examine the impact of IMF programmes on mortality rates amongst children under the age of 5 per 1,000 live births in 176 countries between 1990 and 2017. IMF programmes are shown to cause up to 90 excess under-5 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 50–130). This aggregate effect appears to be driven by large-scale privatisation reforms, which cause up to 132 excess child deaths per 1,000 live births (72–191). These parameter estimates are robust to a range of sensitivity checks.

The analysis relies on two incentive experiments and their effects on panel recruitment and the intermediate participation in the recruitment survey. The experiments were implemented in the context of the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study and encompass two samples of randomly sampled persons. Tested incentives include a conditional lottery, conditional monetary incentives, and the combination of unconditional money-in-hand with conditional monetary incentives. For an encompassing evaluation of the link between incentives and panel recruitment, the article further assesses the incentives’ implications for demographic composition and panel recruitment unit costs. Multivariate analysis indicates that low combined incentives (€5/€5) or, where unconditional disbursement is unfeasible, high conditional incentives (€20) are most effective in enhancing panel participation. In terms of demographic bias, low combined incentives (€5/€5) and €10 conditional incentives are the favored options.

While the crisis has been acknowledged, it is often approached in human-centred terms, with framings that limit the moral worth of nonhuman nature to its contribution to human well-being. We derive and propose the concept of planetary well-being to recognise the moral considerability of both human and nonhuman well-being, and to promote transdisciplinary, cross-cultural discourse for addressing ecological and social crises and for promoting societal and cultural transformation. Conceptually, we shift focus in well-being from individuals to Earth system and ecosystem processes that underlie all well-being. Planetary well-being is a state where the integrity of Earth system and ecosystem processes remains unimpaired to a degree that species and populations can persist to the future and organisms have the opportunity to achieve well-being.

people, including young adults. However, there is little knowledge about the stability of early careers
and its life course social and health-related determinants. The aim of this study is to identify what
kind of typical patterns of work participation and transitions between different statuses can be
identified among young adults after their first entry into the labour market, and to examine whether
the timing of entry together with parental and own socioeconomic position and health predict early
work participation patterns.
Methods: We used the Finnish Birth Cohort 1987 including data from several registers from all
59,476 children born in 1987 as well as their parents, followed until the end of 2015. We created
sequences of monthly work participation statuses starting from the calendar month when a cohort
member had their first at least six-month long spell in employment or entrepreneurship. Work
participation statuses (8 categories) were collected for 60 months or until the end of the follow-up. We
included altogether 51,871 individuals with an entry into paid employment, who could be followed
for at least 12 subsequent months. Parental social and health-related covariates were included from
national registers. We used first sequence analysis and cluster analysis to identify latent groups of
individuals with similar work participation patterns. Next, we estimated a mixture Markov model that
allows for identification of latent classes of labour market attachment, estimation of labour market
transitions within classes, and prediction of class membership using childhood social and healthrelated
determinants.
Results: We observed that entry into the labour market as measured by six months in continuous
employment was not a permanent entry for many, not only due to unemployment and health-related
exits but also due to studies and parental leave. During the first five years, we observed a fairly linear
relationship between the age at entry and early work participation pattern: individuals entering the
labour market at a later age were more likely to be in continuous employment thereafter (all else
equal). Regarding both own and parental social- and health-related childhood factors, latent classes
show clear patterns of accumulated advantage and disadvantage: more advantaged background
predicted exits due to studies or – when following a late entry – stable employment, while
disadvantaged background factors predicted more unstable work and long-term exits from the labour
market.
Conclusions: There are varied work participation patterns and transitions between employment
statuses among young employees. More in-depth understanding of these patterns and their
determinants is important to plan targeted interventions and to promote more stable work participation
among young adults.",TRUE,FALSE,birth cohort study|Early employment|labour market attachment|Markov model|sequence analysis|young adulthood,2021-03-12T07:39:41.824474,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-12T07:39:30.900735,FALSE,NA,no,"The data that support the findings of this study are not publicly available due to data protections laws and regulations.

Investigating the public’s response to various pandemic restrictions can provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policymakers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor reactions to controversial restrictions. 

Objective: Using data from social media, this study aims to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (e.g. business and school closure, regional lockdown differences, additional public health restrictions such as social distancing and masking). 

Methods: COVID-related tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected based on keywords between March 12 to Oct 31 2020. Sentiment scores were calculated using the VADER algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using government and news media websites, and dynamic regression models with ARIMA errors were used to examine the association between public health restrictions and changes in public opinion over time (i.e. collective attention, aggregate positive sentiment, and level of disagreement) controlling for the effects of confounders (i.e. daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, COVID-related official updates). 

Results: In addition to expected direct effects (e.g. business closure led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the impact of restriction on public opinion is contextually driven. For example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts.  While school closure and other restrictions (e.g. masking, social distancing, and travel restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (i.e. sentiment polarization). Partial (region-targeted) lockdowns were associated with better public response (i.e. higher number of tweets with net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to province-wide lockdowns. 

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic restrictions using near real-time social media data.

New experimental techniques, such as the pneumatic trough, voltaic pile, spectroscopy, and potassium analysis led to the discovery of many new elements and their properties which enabled the discovery of the periodic table. The discoveries led to the demise of the classical theory of the elements, to the end of the phlogiston theory and to the creation of the modern ideas of the elements and of the atomic theory. The paper shows the discoveries were made in a necessary and inevitable order with new experimental techniques leading to the discovery of new elements which eventually led to the discovery of the periodic table.",TRUE,FALSE,Avogadro theory|big history|cultural evolution|John Dalton|Joseph Priestley|Lavoisier|law of conservation of mass|Mendeleev|periodic table|phlogiston theory|pneumatic trough|potassium analysis|spectroscopy|speculative philosophy of history|substantive philosophy of history|teleological history|voltaic pile,2021-03-12T17:57:01.830645,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-12T17:56:50.081353,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/citation/,w3vb4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604acdd736e58b00bbbc033f/,604acdd736e58b00bbbc033f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w3vb4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w3vb4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w3vb4,NA

The goal of which was a targeted presentation of the benefits of Bayesian analysis in crime research geared to policymakers. The method is assessed using a Model-Comparison Approach and model performance metrics. The study shows that Naïve Bayes can be useful in predictive classification where the target population is small or difficult to acquire such as offender profiling and analysis of high crime areas. This is important as it provides a plausible option to traditional Frequentist methods, that overcome statistical limitations and provides results in a form easily conveyable to policymakers. Further, the conditional probability data produced makes future prediction transparent and can foster confidence in predicted outcomes. In particular, Directed Acyclic Graph can be easily used to represent the Naïve Bayes output allowing visualization of the relationships between variables.",TRUE,FALSE,analysing crime|Bayesian methods|preditive modelling|research for practitioners and policymakers|visualizing forecasts,2021-03-12T00:08:21.407368,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-12T00:08:09.547196,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Troy Smith,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/citation/,ecjs9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604a5adfb57c9c007c807b5f/,604a5adfb57c9c007c807b5f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecjs9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ecjs9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ecjs9,NA

It argues that not all central bank purchases of government bonds are alike, but they should be evaluated against the objectives of the interventions and the broader macro-financial setup of the economy. It distinguishes two regimes of monetary financing – shadow vs subordinated – across  objectives of intervention, targets, institutional hierarchy,  macroeconomic paradigm, and accumulation regime/distribution of political power. Shadow monetary financing, it argues, offers a weak framework for monetary-fiscal interactions, one that actively undermines both the rethink of fiscal rules, and fiscal support for the low-carbon transition.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-11T12:56:20.960916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-11T12:55:57.492362,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,Daniela Veronica Gabor,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/citation/,ja9bk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604a0be5b57c9c00648065bd/,604a0be5b57c9c00648065bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja9bk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ja9bk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ja9bk,NA
