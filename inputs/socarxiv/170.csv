Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. 

Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have.

Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19.

Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.",TRUE,FALSE,conflict|COVID-19|decision-making|family|health|parenthood|relationships|work-family,2020-10-09T18:52:21.886272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09T18:52:13.888849,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Jessica McCrory Calarco|Emily Meanwell|Elizabeth Anderson|and Amelia Knopf,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/citation/,cpkj6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8081a3cc246f02537545f6/,5f8081a3cc246f02537545f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cpkj6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cpkj6,NA

This study evaluates the initiative’s effects on crime, civilian complaints, racial disparities, and arrests. Using monthly data on New York City’s 76 police precincts between 2006 and 2019, we estimate the policy’s causal effect using high-dimensional time series models. This approach accounts for the policy’s staggered adoption, addresses potential correlation among outcomes and between precincts, and controls for unobserved precinct characteristics.

In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are particularly relevant for older people’s mental health implications.

This study evaluates sociodemographic, economic, and psychological factors associated with COVID-19 testing motivations.
Methods: We used data from the Person to Person Health Interview Study, collected by telephone in April and May 2020, using a representative sample of Indiana residents (n=943). Testing intentions were assessed across six motivations: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others. Bivariate analyses and ordinal logistic models were used to assess the influence of race/ethnicity, education, financial strain, and COVID-19 worries on each outcome. 
Results: Respondents strongly agree that symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others would be important considerations in COVID-19 test decisions. Black and Latino respondents were more likely than white respondents to agree that ability to work if positive (b = 0.48 and 0.96) and hospital effectiveness (b = 0.92 and 0.96) would influence their decision to get tested. Test affordability (b = 2.80), hospital effectiveness (b = 2.00), and risk of transmission (b = 0.99) were considerations among participants reporting financial strain. Desire to reduce transmission (b = 1.49) and concern about proximity to infected (b = 2.66) were reported among those who expressed COVID-19 worries.
Conclusions: In a representative sample in Indiana, people consider their own and others’ vulnerability to COVID-19 in testing decisions.

The fourteenth-century Black Death, which is usually believed to have led to a significant reduction in economic inequality, has attracted the greatest attention. However, the picture becomes much more complex if other epidemics are considered. This article covers the worst epidemics of preindustrial times, from Justinian’s Plague of 540-41 to the last great European plagues of the seventeenth century, as well as the cholera waves of the nineteenth. It shows how the distributive outcomes of lethal epidemics do not only depend upon mortality rates, but are mediated by a range of factors, chief among them the institutional framework in place at the onset of each crisis. It then explores how past epidemics affected poverty, arguing that highly lethal epidemics could reduce its prevalence through two deeply different mechanisms: redistribution towards the poor, or extermination of the poor. It concludes by recalling the historical connection between the progressive weakening and spacing in time of lethal epidemics and improvements in life expectancy, and by discussing how epidemics affected inequality in health and living standards.

This study is conducted in two phases of investigation. Phase I examined the correlation between teachers’ knowledge and actual use of SQ. Phase II study investigated the application of Omani EFL teachers’ knowledge of SQ on students’ CT in post-basic schools. The present study made an attempt to (a) Determine the relationship between teachers’ knowledge of SQ and their actual use of SQ. (b) Ascertain whether there is any statistically significant difference between mean scores of those who are taught through SQ and those who are taught CT skills in a normal setting.

They were divided into two groups: an experimental group consisting of 18 students, forming nine pairs, to perform reading activities dialogically in Moodle and a control group of 18 students to perform reading activities individually in classrooms. The researcher used pre-post reading comprehension tests and a scale of SCMC-based dialogical collaborative reading attitudes. as research instruments to collect data. Data were analyzed using means and standard deviation, an independent sample t-test, a paired sample t-test, an Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA) and a one sample t-test. The findings revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in the post-test average scores of the experimental group, which indicated the effectiveness of text-based dyadic collaborative dialogue on reading comprehension. Additionally, compared to other reading skills, making inferences skill was revealed to be the skill most affected by dyadic dialogues in SCMC. Besides, the participants exhibited positive attitudes toward their collaborative dialogues with peers in SCMC to foster their reading comprehension. Finally, pedagogical implementations and recommendations for future studies were suggested to explore the area of SCMC-based collaborative dialogue on language learning",TRUE,FALSE,Peer-collaborative dialogue|quasi-experimental study|reading comprehension|SCMC|Synchronous computer-mediated communication|text-based online chat,2020-10-08T21:34:21.653660,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-08T21:34:00.866641,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/citation/,2ze85,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e7eb31f65a5013bed71db/,5f7e7eb31f65a5013bed71db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ze85/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2ze85/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2ze85,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.260

They show resistance and resilience to change via variable attitudes towards CBLT. The paper reports the results of a field investigation carried out in eight secondary schools in Adrar, cultural and administrative capital of the southwest of Algeria. It assesses south Algerian EFL teachers’ attitudes towards CBLT through a questionnaire administered to twenty educators. The most striking answers are the teachers’ negative attitudes and diverging opinions toward its “top-down” implementation. The findings highlight a major issue to the Ministry of Education, the syllabus designers and the teachers at the micro-level, for they impact negatively on the spread and success of CBLT.

The approach is predicated on the methodological correlation between the three validity claims of truth, truthfulness, and rightness, on the one hand, and the respective speech acts of constatives, expressives, and regulatives, on the other. The data used for analysis is the resignation speech delivered by the ex-Prime Minister of the UK, Theresa May, on 24 May 2019 in Downing Street, following her political failure to deliver Brexit.  The study derives its significance from attempting to uncover the pragma-argumentatively motivated interdiscursive patterns in May’s speech. In other words, the explanatory power of traditional interdiscursivity can be enhanced through integrating the pragma-argumentative component of validity-claim theory into the current form of political interdiscursive analysis. The study’s main finding is that, with the presence of pragma-argumentative links, there are four rationally oriented interdiscursive relations in May’s speech: (a) practical-aesthetic, (b) practical-theoretical, (c) theoretical-aesthetic, and (d) aesthetic-theoretical. Two crucial implications have emerged from this finding: (i) the dominant interdiscursive pattern in May’s speech is the practical-aesthetic interdiscourse, where May justifies her validity claims to truthfulness through the normative context of what best serves the UK’s political interests; (ii) both cases of theoretical-aesthetic and aesthetic-theoretical interdiscourses proved to have a dialectically interdiscursive meaning on the rational basis that two discourses are reciprocally justifying – and at some point, legitimating – each other.",TRUE,FALSE,Brexit|interdiscursivity|Jürgen Habermas|resignation speech|speech acts|Theresa May|validity-theoretic approach,2020-10-08T21:34:42.307895,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-08T21:34:30.009038,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/citation/,5w6sr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7e7d29a5e947011d1bde8c/,5f7e7d29a5e947011d1bde8c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5w6sr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5w6sr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5w6sr,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no3.37
