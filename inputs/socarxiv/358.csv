Departing from their informal use in the survey research literature, we discuss how DAGs can also be used to encode theoretical assumptions about nonprobability samples and survey nonresponse and to determine whether population quantities, including conditional distributions and regressions, can be identified from a sample. We describe sources of bias and assumptions for eliminating it in selection scenarios familiar from the missing data literature. We then introduce and analyze graphical representations of multiple selection stages in the data collection process, and highlight the strong assumptions implicit in using only design weights. Furthermore, we show that the common practice of selecting adjustment variables based on empirical correlations is ill-justified and that nonresponse weighting when the interest is in causal inference may come at severe costs.

To address the extent of political like-mindedness in online communication, we argue that it is necessary to focus not only on ideological homogeneity in online environments, but also on the extent to which specific political questions are discussed in a uniform manner. This study proposes an innovative combination of computational methods, including natural language processing and social network analysis, that serves as a model for future research examining the evolution of opinion climates in online networks. Data were gathered on YouTube, enabling the assessment of users’ expressed opinions on three political issues (i.e., adoption rights for same-sex couples, headscarf rights, and climate change). Challenging widely held assumptions on discursive homogeneity online, the results provide evidence for a moderate level of connections between dissimilar YouTube comments but few connections between agreeing comments.

Eleven (11) nurses working for at least three (3) years from three (3) selected hemodialysis units within Metro Manila participated in this study. Multiple face to face in-depth interviews, story-telling sessions and non-participatory observation were utilized to create the individual narratives from where the patterns and expressions of caring were later explicated. 
After a series of content analysis following the focused ethnography design, three patterns and expressions of caring were then identified: (1) being at the moment, (2) transcending perceived boundaries and (3) harmonizing with technology. These patterns represent for informants their unique expressions of caring in the context of working in a hemodialysis unit. It reflects a moment to moment transitioning between caring for and caring with persons thru technology.
Insights from this study suggest that the nature of caring as articulated by the informants is an expression of their anticipated role as career within the moment and their perceived image of the person being cared for. 
Professional role clarification, fluency in communication and technological competency training were implied as possible ways of strengthening their perception of being caring which in the end could improve patient outcomes.

To identify a causal effect, we instrument county level repatriations with the existence of a railway line to Mexico interacted with the size of the Mexican communities in 1910. Using individual linked data we find that Mexican repatriations reduced employment of native incumbent workers and resulted in their occupational downgrading. However, using a repeated cross section of county level data, we find attenuated and non-significant employment effects and amplified wage downgrading. We show that this is due to selective in- and out-migration of natives.",TRUE,FALSE,employment|Great Depression|immigration|Mexican repatriations|railway,2019-11-24T20:03:03.457045,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-24T20:02:35.761726,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/citation/,epyzh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd844246fc769000cd546c1/,5dd844246fc769000cd546c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epyzh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/epyzh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/epyzh,NA

They are said to lack accuracy, encourage gaming and ultimately fail to improve performance. Yet, despite their well-documented weaknesses, performance indicators abound in governance. This article asks under which conditions performance indicators can improve performance outcomes, despite these proven weaknesses and dysfunctions. Our case study is the stress test of the European banking system, a high-profile performance indicator used for risk regulation. Based on interviews with risk managers in Belgian banks as well as staff at the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and the National Bank of Belgium, we find that the process of calculating the stress test improves performance outcomes in itself. It does so by fostering banks’ capacity to self-regulate, tying into Foucault’s notion of governmentality. As such, practitioners and academics should not only pay attention to how performance results can be used, but also examine how the process of calculating the performance indicator might be designed to improve performance outcomes latently.",TRUE,FALSE,governmentality|performance indicators|stress test,2019-11-24T19:55:40.844428,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-24T19:55:28.978723,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/citation/,vf9yn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7e7466fc769000ad4d9c4/,5dd7e7466fc769000ad4d9c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vf9yn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vf9yn,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020852319857804
