Empirical Study on the Farming Community in Malaysia,"Changes in climatic factors have different impacts on different social groups. But the farmers are considered to be the most vulnerable group because of their direct and indirect dependency on climatic factors. This study aims to understand the nature of socioeconomic impacts of climatic changes on the farmers in Malaysia. A questionnaire survey was conducted on a sample of 198 paddy farmers in the Integrated Agricultural Development Area at North-West Selangor of Malaysia in 2009. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ordinal scale and percentile. The study reveals that climatic changes have adverse impacts on agricultural productivity, profitability, income equality, employment, farmer’s health, and government subsidy policy. The Kuznets ratio and Gini coefficient indicate that there is highly unequal distribution of income. Climatic changes are contributing to the widening of this income gap, because poor farmers are affected more by the adverse effects of climatic changes. The current government subsidy policy is not found appropriate and adequate to support and encourage the farmers to adequately adapt to the climatic changes and to reduce the inequality among the farming community.

Therefore, this study is an attempt to assess the status of the current level of organizational learning orientation among the Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in Malaysia. The data were collected based on opinions of the ten factors of organizational learning practices by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Further, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach’s alpha test, the validity of the data was tested by checking the normality test through skewness and kurtosis, and the consistency of the data was tested using factor analysis. On an average, 74.6% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of organizational learning. The federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on organizational learning than the state owned GLCs. This study suggests improving the practices of organizational learning within the GLCs in Malaysia by emphasizing on the consideration that employee learning is an investment rather than an expense, employees should view themselves as partners in charting the direction of the organization, employees should not be afraid of critically reflecting on the shared assumptions about the ways of managing the organization, and by analyzing unsuccessful organizational endeavours and communicating the lessons learned widely among the employees.",TRUE,FALSE,government-linked companies|Malaysia|organizational learning|sustainable competitive advantage,2019-06-13T19:10:03.116702,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T19:09:42.972991,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/citation/,yt4xd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c748p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/relationships/node/,c748p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020a0fe2124b001a3819fc/,5d020a0fe2124b001a3819fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yt4xd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yt4xd

Various efforts and approaches through government interventions have been implemented to ensure the continuity of paddy production in this area. However, there are different factors that have negative impacts on paddy production including climatic factors. Therefore, with the direct components of production such as land, labor, and technology, this study uses climatic factors and government intervention to examine the influence of these factors of production on the paddy production in this area. Based on the time series data from 1981 to 2010, this study conducted the multiple log linear Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression by considering the Cobb-Douglas production function model. The major units of production, such as land, labor, and technology, have a statistically positive relationship with paddy production. Among the climatic variables, rainfall and the number of rainy days show a statistically significant and positive relationship but temperature shows a negative relationship with paddy production. The factors of external intervention such as government subsidies and market forces also show a statistically significant and positive relationship with paddy production. To ensure the improvement of paddy production as well as to minimize the effects of climatic change, government intervention should be continued in Malaysia.",TRUE,FALSE,Muda Irrigation Area; Climate Change; Paddy; Government Intervention; Cobb-Douglas Production Function; Technology; Malaysia,2019-06-13T19:09:45.614183,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T19:09:22.701402,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/citation/,z7hw4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/udg2v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/relationships/node/,udg2v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020924e2124b00193816a0/,5d020924e2124b00193816a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z7hw4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z7hw4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z7hw4
