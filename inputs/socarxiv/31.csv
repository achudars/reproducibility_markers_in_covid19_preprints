We aim to fill this gap by using data from the 2018 Fertility Survey (14,556 women and 2.619 men) for Spain, a country with one of the lowest levels of fertility in the world. Data on ideal family size, intended fertility, and reported reasons for not yet having (more) children allow us to estimate the extent of unrealized fertility as well as the reported relative importance of economic, health, and partnership related reasons for unrealized fertility. Results confirm that observed fertility is clearly below desired fertility in Spain. Material reasons - associated with job insecurity, instability, economic resources - are the main reported reasons why women and men do not have the desired number of children. These reasons are followed by those related to partnership (not having a stable partner), and health (difficulties in conceiving). Estimates based on actual fertility, employment, and partnerships shows that having a stable partner between the ages of 25 and 35 is a proximate determinant of the transition to the first child.",TRUE,FALSE,Low Fertility|Obstacles|Spain|Unrealized Fertility,2021-04-19T21:15:42.555466,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-19T19:02:32.094016,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://ine.es/dyngs/INEbase/es/operacion.htm?c=Estadistica_C&amp;cid=1254736177006&amp;menu=ultiDatos&amp;idp=1254735573002,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/citation/,45j23,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607d93e50c81820273513d81/,607d93e50c81820273513d81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45j23/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/45j23/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/45j23

Yet most approaches to date look at isolated components of wildlife markets, hindering our ability to intervene effectively to improve sustainability. To better assess and intervene in wildlife markets, we propose a framework that integrates three analytical levels. The first level, “actor”, assesses the underlying motivations and mechanisms that allow or constrain how actors benefit from wildlife markets. The second level, “inter-actor”, assesses the configuration of wildlife product supply-chains and the type of competition between actors participating in wildlife markets. The third level, “market”, evaluates overarching dynamics, quantity and price determinants, and the presence and effect of illegal products flowing into markets. We showcase the utility of the framework in a data-limited small-scale fishery case study (common hake, Merluccius gayi gayi in Chile); our mixed-method analysis provided relevant, tailored management recommendations for improving sustainability.

Combining political economy models of arms trade with the literatures on trade preferences and foreign policy attitudes, we argue that citizens trade off economic incentives, strategic interests and moral considerations when assessing arms trade and that deeply rooted `strategic cultures’ lead to differences in citizen preferences between countries. To derive the implicit weighting of different features of arms trade, we draw on population-representative conjoint survey experiments (N=6,617), fielded in November/December 2020 in two of the global top-5 exporting countries of major arms: Germany and France. We find that both country populations show structured preferences towards arms exports which predominantly center around their moral repercussions. However, German respondents place more weight on moral consequences and, compared to French respondents, a larger share is in fundamental opposition.

Children who spent time in non-parental care report poor outcomes in many aspects of their later lives on average, but less is known about differences by ethnicity.  We examined whether the health, socioeconomic, family, and living arrangements of adults who had been in non-parental care across the first three decades of adult life varied by ethnicity (White, Black, South Asian).
Methods
We used longitudinal data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (LS).  Participants were aged&lt;18 years and had never been married at baseline of each census year from 1971-2001 (n= 672,648).  Separately for each adult follow-up age group (20 to 29; 30 to 39; 40 to 49), multi-level regression models were used to compare socioeconomic, family, and living arrangements by non-parental care and ethnicity interactions.
Results
Adverse adult outcomes following an experience of non-parental care were conditional on the interaction of non-parental care with ethnicity, mainly in the socioeconomic domain. More negative adult outcomes among the ethnic minority groups following non-parental care in childhood were not found consistently: for some outcomes the White group had poorer outcomes; South Asian individuals had better outcomes than Black people who had been in non-parental care but the within-ethnic group differences were smaller for Black than for South Asian children; and findings differed across the lifespan from early to mid-adulthood as work and family lives evolved.
Conclusion
We uncovered much complexity, with minority ethnicity moderating the non-parental care to adult outcomes relationship in both positive and negative ways.

They have achieved considerable success, with over three-quarters of Americans reporting that they follow all the recommended precautionary practices of social distancing, so it is likely that, at least, they follow most of them most of the time. But there is an elephant in the room: Overnighting – staying overnight at someone else’s home or having them stay overnight at your place is rarely, if ever, mentioned publicly. But we will show that this is a widespread practice in American society, throughout the epidemic thus far. In the past month, over half of all Americans had at least one overnight guest and about the same number (but not always the same people) spent at least one night in the past month at somebody else's home. The consequences are striking:  People who overnight are more than twice as likely to report that they have had COVID-19. Who overnights? The practice is much more common among young adults (over 60% for those 25-34) than among their seniors (dipping below 30% for those age 65 and over). Moreover, risk seekers are hugely more likely to overnight than are their otherwise similar risk averse peers.

Serendipitously, the same synchronic facts have been analysed twice earlier without the benefit of the full diachronic backstory, and so present a retrospective case study in what diachrony offers for the analysis of rara, structures which by definition are difficult to contextualize using synchronic typology alone.

Prediction gives an intuitive measure of a model's (in)ability to structure an outcome of interest, and complements the aggregate statistics usually obtained from typical in-sample methods. In this paper, I illustrate the potential of prediction through the study of teacher bias in tracking in the Netherlands. I show how the use of prediction identifies misspecification in the simple interval-model often estimated in the field, and can be used to obtain insights when estimating less interpretable, albeit more appropriate models. Substantively, I find that girls are positively biased in tracking net of observed ability, while students of low parental education are negatively biased. Importantly, the latter effect may have been structurally under-estimated in prior work.

Disentangling the causes for the varying sizes of minimum income schemes,"The sizes of minimum income schemes vary significantly even in welfare states that are considered similar. For example among Nordic countries, the share of recipients is almost double in Finland compared to Nordic peers. Considering the strong political will to diminish the receipt of last-resort benefits, we demonstrate a methodological framework to evaluate the reasons for varying number of beneficiaries and apply it to two Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden. By using microsimulation of eligibility rates, we examine the role of social assistance legislation, first-tier benefits and non-take-up. Relatively high number of beneficiaries in Finland is traced back to social assistance policies such as higher norm levels and earning disregard but also to lower non-take-up rate of social assistance benefits, which potentially reflects looser discretion and asset test. We also find some, albeit weak, evidence that the implementation reform of social assistance in Finland 2017 has further reduced non-take-up.",TRUE,FALSE,income|microsimulation|Nordic countries|social assistance|social assistance benefits|social security|welfare state,2021-04-19T03:23:06.411752,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-19T03:22:49.372926,FALSE,NA,no,The analysis is based on harmonized EU-SILC surveys that are compiled by Eurostat from standardized national surveys and administrative registers.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",Jussi Tervola|Merita Jokela|Joonas Ollonqvist,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/citation/,kw6uh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607bcc09eb9cc901e515473c/,607bcc09eb9cc901e515473c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw6uh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw6uh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw6uh

But the approval process is slow and cautious. The faster, but perhaps riskier, Russian system (like the Chinese) produced an approved coronavirus vaccine months more quickly, leaving Americans at risk of dying for months longer than Russians. Despite widespread fears that many would be hesitant to accept vaccination at all, and understandable doubts about vaccine approval processes outside the US, data from two national surveys in September 2020 show, very surprisingly, that a majority of Americans at that time would have willingly taken the Russian  vaccine. Moreover a two-to-one majority of Americans – rich and poor, young and old, Democrat and Republican alike  –  believed that they ought to be allowed to buy it. Based on those figures, we estimate that making the Russian vaccine (or the Chinese) immediately available would have saved 70 or more American lives each day in the autumn of 2020 and the beginning of 2021. To put that in context, US government prohibitions on Russian and Chinese vaccines cost more lives each day than the roughly 45 people killed daily by all American murderers combined. For the US government, a less authoritarian domestic policy, and a clearer appreciation of the globalization of medical technology, would seem to be indicated.",TRUE,FALSE,China|coronavirus|covid|FDA|medical morality|medical policy|public opinion|public policy|Russia|Sputnik-5|survey research|USA|vaccination|vaccine hesistancy,2021-04-19T03:19:41.493281,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-19T03:19:27.217862,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,the authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/citation/,q9uzx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607b9990eb9cc901e714efab/,607b9990eb9cc901e714efab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9uzx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q9uzx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q9uzx
