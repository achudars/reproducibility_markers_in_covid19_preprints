We provide evidence on the monthly rates of initiation of divorce and separation filings in Denmark for the period 2016-2020 to examine how filing behavior changed during 2020 compared to the four previous years. Because filing rates precedes a divorce, rates reflect more precise the temporal dynamic of divorce initiation. Rates of initiation of divorce filings declined in 2020 to the lowest level in the period 2016-2020. On average, monthly rates in 2020 were 7 percent lower than 2019 rates and 20 percent lower than 2016 rates.

This work is part of a larger study that aims to tackle these two challenges using a variety of machine learning techniques. To that end, this paper proposes the use of k-means algorithm to cluster students based on 12 engagement metrics divided into two categories: interaction-related and effort-related. Quantitative analysis is performed to identify the students that are not engaged who may need help. Three different clustering models are considered: two-level, three-level, and five-level. The considered dataset is the students’ event log of a second-year undergraduate Science course from a North American university that was given in a blended format. The event log is transformed using MATLAB to generate a new dataset representing the considered metrics. Experimental results’ analysis shows that among the considered interaction-related and effort-related metrics, the number of logins and the average duration to submit assignments are the most representative of the students’ engagement level. Furthermore, using the silhouette coefficient as a performance metric, it is shown that the two-level model offers the best performance in terms of cluster separation. However, the three-level model has a similar performance while better identifying students with low engagement levels.",TRUE,FALSE,Clustering|eLearning|Engagement Level|K-means|Machine Learning|Quantitative Analysis|Silhouette coefficient,2021-01-19T06:04:26.540020,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-19T06:03:48.104915,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/Western-OC2-Lab/Student-Performance-and-Engagement-Prediction-eLearning-datasets/tree/main/Student%20Engagement%20Level%20Prediction%20-%20Binary%20Case|https://github.com/Western-OC2-Lab/Student-Performance-and-Engagement-Prediction-eLearning-datasets/tree/main/Student%20Engagement%20Level%20Prediction%20-%20Multiclass%20Case,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/citation/,ecg4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6005d249ba010907a88902bd/,6005d249ba010907a88902bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecg4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ecg4x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ecg4x,https://doi.org/10.1080/08923647.2020.1696140

We advance the explanatory power of the theory by measuring cultural capital in terms of mastery rather than participation or attendance using data on more than 12 thousand schools about their success in interscholastic athletics. We find that predominantly middle-class schools win more contests and by larger margins than economically integrated and predominantly working-class schools. The margins of victory become larger as the social class differences between the opposing schools grows. We also find evidence consistent with resistance theory because predominantly working class schools also experience success, albeit relatively modest.

Questionable research practices (QRPs) lead to incorrect research results and contribute to irreproducibility in science. Researchers and institutions have proposed open science practices (OSPs) to improve the detectability of QRPs and the credibility of science. We examine the prevalence of QRPs and OSPs in criminology, and researchers’ opinions of those practices.

Methods. We administered an anonymous survey to authors of articles published in criminology journals. Respondents self-reported their own use of 10 QRPs and 5 OSPs. They also estimated the prevalence of use by others, and reported their attitudes toward the practices. 
 
Results. QRPs and OSPs are both common in quantitative criminology, about as common as they are in other fields. Criminologists who responded to our survey support using QRPs in some circumstances, but are even more supportive of using OSPs. We did not detect a significant relationship between methodological training and either QRP or OSP use. Support for QRPs is negatively and significantly associated with support for OSPs. Perceived prevalence estimates for some practices resembled a uniform distribution, suggesting criminologists have little knowledge of the proportion of researchers that engage in certain questionable practices.

Conclusions. Most quantitative criminologists in our sample use QRPs, and many use multiple QRPs. The substantial prevalence of QRPs raises questions about the validity and reproducibility of published criminological research. We found promising levels of OSP use, albeit at levels lagging what researchers endorse. The findings thus suggest that additional reforms are needed to decrease QRP use and increase the use of OSPs.",TRUE,FALSE,criminology|meta-research|metascience|open science|p-hacking|qrps|quantitative criminology|questionable research practices|reproducibility|researcher degrees of freedom|survey,2021-01-18T08:49:21.261459,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-18T08:48:54.070793,TRUE,"Jason Chin is the president of the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-research and Open Science (AIMOS), an organization that promotes open science practices.",available,NA,https://github.com/alexholcombe/ChinHolcombePickettVazireCrimSurvey,available,NA,https://osf.io/qvcdg/registrations,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/citation/,bwm7s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qvcdg/,qvcdg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6005034ee80d370730a5c762/,6005034ee80d370730a5c762,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwm7s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bwm7s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bwm7s,NA

We map out inclusion and exclusion under Scheduled and non-Scheduled languages and their mother tongues and their representation in state bureaucracies, the judiciary, and education. We highlight that Census classification leads to the delegitimization of ‘mother tongues’ that deserve the status of the language and official recognition by the state. We argue that the blanket exclusion of languages and mother tongues based on numerical thresholds disregards the languages of about 18.7 million speakers in India.  We compute and map the Linguistic Diversity Index of India at the national and state levels and show that the exclusion of mother tongues undermines the linguistic diversity of states. We show that the Hindi belt shows the maximum divergence in Language and Mother Tongue Diversity. We stress the need for India to officially acknowledge the linguistic diversity of states and make the Census classification and enumeration to reflect the true Linguistic diversity.",TRUE,FALSE,Census of India|Language classfication|Language Diversity Index|Language Family|Languages India|Linguistic Minorities,2021-01-15T21:35:42.026007,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-15T21:35:27.952637,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language_MTs.html|https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-16.html|https://censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-9.pdf|https://censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Part-A.pdf|https://censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Part-B.pdf,no,The analysis is based on secondary data published by Census 2011.

This paper studies the effect of changes in the minimum wage on spatial equilibriums in local labor markets. Using residence and workplace data for the United States, I analyze how commuting, residence, and employment locations change across city and state borders if the minimum wage changes on one side of the border. I find that areas in which the minimum wage increases receive fewer low-wage commuters. A 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces the inflow of low-wage commuters by about 2.5 percent. Rises in the minimum wage are also associated with employment relocation across borders toward areas that did not witness an increase in the minimum wage. I formulate a spatial equilibrium gravity model to explain the distribution of workers between low- and high-minimum wage areas. I calculate counterfactual equilibriums with a higher minimum wage for U.S. counties with cities considering an increase, highlighting the role of commuting and migration responses. About two-fifths of the counties considering increases would receive fewer low-wage commuters. Employment relocation away from high-minimum wage areas drives the commuting losses.",TRUE,FALSE,Commuting|Migration|Minimum Wage|Spatial Equilibrium,2021-01-15T08:31:02.471361,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-15T08:30:48.452185,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/|https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0047272719300052-mmc1.pdf|https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs|https://www.census.gov/topics/population.html|https://www.bls.gov/lau/|https://www.bls.gov/cew/|https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113026/version/V1/view|https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/how-much-would-a-state-earned-income-tax-credit-cost-in-fiscal-year|https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/|https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp|https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2010.html|https://qwiexplorer.ces.census.gov/static/explore.html,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/citation/,fpx9e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6000dc8986541a05da14b649/,6000dc8986541a05da14b649,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fpx9e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fpx9e,NA
