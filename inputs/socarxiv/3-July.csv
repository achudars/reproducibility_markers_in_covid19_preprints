Yet, most prior work on vaccine equity focuses on vaccine hesitancy and seldom compares the vaccine trajectories of neighborhoods with varying COVID-19 levels. Notably scarce are also studies that examine the extent to which vaccination helps reduce inequalities in the prevalence of COVID-19. Using administrative data from the City of Toronto, we compare the vaccine trajectories of neighborhoods with low, moderate, and high COVID-19 rates. We also examine whether disparities in COVID-19 rates by a neighborhood’s COVID-19 rates as vaccinations have increased.  By mid-June 2021, differences in vaccination rates by the neighborhoods’ COVID-19 levels are small. The vaccination rollout has only had a small impact on disparities in COVID-19 rates across neighborhoods.

Drawing on data from focus groups undertaken in inner Sydney, Australia, we link the sensory and aesthetic preconditions of fear of crime to its affective, behavioural and cognitive elements. We argue that fear is grounded in the structural, personal and inter-subjective components of individual’s lives and their interaction with physical and social environments, which then influence how individuals cognitively understand their own risks and react behaviourally to these emotional responses. By bringing alive the importance of environmental cues and the cultural and structural positions of those who are likely to frequently worry about victimisation, we hope to provoke a minor reassessment of, and encourage more focus on, fear’s sensory and aesthetic origins.",TRUE,FALSE,affect|everyday aesthetics|fear of crime|sensory|space,2021-07-11T15:33:51.260143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-11T15:33:32.820568,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/citation/,qnxfj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e81a7ef80fdb013b4d8db1/,60e81a7ef80fdb013b4d8db1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnxfj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qnxfj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qnxfj

Experimental studies show that social mechanisms are pivotal for sustaining prosocial behaviour over time. One such mechanism is social contagion, which we broadly define as an individual changing their behaviour in response to the behaviour of others. This study examines to what extent and through what individual-level mechanisms social contagion affects repeated blood donation behaviour, an ideal-typical manifestation of real-world prosocial behaviour. We draw on longitudinal survey and register data on the Dutch blood donor population from 2007 to 2014 (N=15,090), and address the potential endogeneity of the donation behaviour of others by using panel data models and an instrumental variable approach. Our results show that a one-unit increase in the number of donations per inhabitant in the focal donor’s neighbourhood is associated with a ten percent increase in the donor’s blood donations. Exploratory analysis attributes this to social contagion within donor couples. Social contagion is not mediated by normative or informational social influence. Instead, it exerts a direct influence on repeated blood donations, and should thus be considered in theory and practice concerned with repeated real-world prosocial behaviour.",TRUE,FALSE,blood donations|collective action|peer effects|prosocial behaviour|social contagion|social influence,2021-07-09T16:28:01.509017,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-09T16:27:33.286619,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WJYVG,prereg_analysis,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/citation/,kjcwh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zq5xy/,zq5xy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e80b10600da501360a4c83/,60e80b10600da501360a4c83,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kjcwh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kjcwh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kjcwh

Utilizing individual- and census block group-level data combined with administrative donation records, I find that those most mobilized by the availability of vouchers belong to groups already overrepresented within the donor pool.

While national pride is essentially exclusive, because shared only by compatriots, trust in social institution is not, and the general interpersonal trust measured as trust in strangers is inclusive by definition. These differences create an opportunity for a variety of interrelations between national pride and various dimensions of social trust, depending on how certain kinds of individuals and institutions are perceived in relation to a country’s identity. This paper presents the results of a research examining interrelations between national pride and social trust in Russia compared to other countries. The empirical data used in the research come from the most recent wave of the World Values Survey, released in 2020. The results show that in Russia, national pride is positively related to trust in all major social institutions, including even international organizations. This pattern is observed in most countries (with the notable exception of the USA, where correlations between national pride and trust in some institutions, such as the press and the UN, are negative). These positive correlations in Russia are the strongest for trust in the churches, the armed forces, and the government; in most other countries, the pattern is similar but much less pronounced: the relation to trust in other institutions is not that weaker. The relation of national pride to various dimensions of interpersonal trust reveals a deeper difference: unlike in most countries, in Russia, national pride has no negative relation to trust in people of another nationality or religion but is significantly negatively related to strangers. Thus, apparently Russian scoring high on national pride are more ready to accept people with any kind of identity, however different from their own, than people whose identity is unknown and undefined.",TRUE,FALSE,institutional trust|interpersonal trust|national pride|Russia|social trust,2021-07-08T17:43:04.391127,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T17:42:47.305477,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp,no,It was not required.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/citation/,yq3nk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e6e520f80fdb00d64d7a77/,60e6e520f80fdb00d64d7a77,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yq3nk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yq3nk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yq3nk

Households may have significant savings and assets that they can draw on to boost their living standards, but may also have debts that depress the living standard they can actually achieve with their disposable income. Using data from the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) this paper offers a picture of poverty in 17 EU countries that takes into account assets and debt, using various approaches. While earlier studies have found that poverty rates tend to be lower when wealth is accounted for, this study highlights the situation of those who become or remain poor even when savings and assets are included. It focusses both on within country patterns of joint income-wealth poverty as on cross-country differences. It is shown that the elderly are generally less prone to being poor once assets are accounted for.  However, for renter households with a young, female, low educated, unemployed or inactive and single head, the risk of being poor when assets and debt are accounted for remains high and in some cases even increases. That is generally the case because they have few assets, rather than because of high debts. The substantial variation in poverty rates observed across countries can to some extent be accounted for by socio-demographic factors but a lot of variation still remains unaccounted for.

Assessing resilience has been elusive due to high levels of abstraction that are difficult to empirically test, or the lack of high quality data required once appropriate proxies are identified. Most resilience assessments are limited to specific situation arenas, making comparision one of the unresolved challenges. Here we show how leveraging comparative analysis can provide insights on how Arctic communities (N = 40) can best deal with social and environmental change. We found that the capacity to self-organize, and nurturing diversity are sufficient conditions for Arctic communities whose livelihoods have been resilient, or for communities whose livelihoods have been transformed. Our study provides an alternative perspective on how to assess resilience by leveraging comparsion across cases.

In 2019, 80% of Greeks were at least somewhat worried about climate change, compared to 20% of Egyptians. We argue that variation in climate change concern is partially caused by differences in democracy. Civil liberties protect climate communicators from state repression, censorship, and violence. We offer empirical evidence for the causal effect of democracy on climate change concern using data from 611,909 individuals from 118 countries collected between 2007 and 2019. Exploiting variation in civil liberties across countries and time, we find one unit change in the 7-point civil liberty index to influence climate change concern by 2.3 [95% CI: ±1] percentage points. The effect is much stronger in wealthy countries and less educated cohorts. We also present evidence for our causal pathway using qualitative interviews and by modeling the association between democracy, climate protest, media coverage, and climate concern with simultaneous equations.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|democracy|media coverage|protests|public opinion,2021-07-08T08:52:48.689055,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T08:52:26.451756,FALSE,NA,no,Supplementary data will be provided in due course.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/citation/,6vk9d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e59d9df80fdb004f4d70d2/,60e59d9df80fdb004f4d70d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vk9d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vk9d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vk9d

In the international business literature, this perspective has been highlighted in research on early internationalization (i.e., the born global strategy). While prior work has focused on the heterogeneity of firm characteristics and capabilities, we present a demand-side view of early internationalization by focusing on network effects. Prior theoretical work on network effects has predicted that when network effects are prominent, survival is challenging for latecomers because of the installed bases of first movers in the global market. However, we see many cases, such as the mobile instant messenger (MIM) market, where no single winner dominates the global market and where many latecomers have survived by implementing early internationalization. We build upon Brian Arthur’s model of demand-side dynamics. The findings suggest that latecomers may overcome their disadvantages by pursuing early internationalization, especially when the direct network effects (i.e., social network effects) are stronger than the indirect network effects (i.e., installed base effects). The underlying rationale is that country borders often demarcate the reach of the direct network effect, limiting the power of installed bases.",TRUE,FALSE,Early internationalization|ibusiness firms|installed base|network effects|social network effect,2021-07-08T08:51:01.768062,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T08:50:49.325800,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Sanghyun Park|Sungyong Chang,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/citation/,d74he,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e5994e600da500460a5012/,60e5994e600da500460a5012,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d74he/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d74he/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d74he
