Seshat contains high-dimensional sociopolitical features for hundreds of polities, from multiple continents, over many thousands of years. Examining the statistical covariations among those social features, we find that the process of sociopolitical development is dominated first by growth in polity scale, then by improvements in its information processing and economic systems, and then by further increases in scale. This allows us to define a Scale Threshold for societies, beyond which growth in information processing becomes paramount, and an Information Threshold, which once crossed permits additional growth in scale. Polities diverge from one another in sociopolitical feature space prior to crossing the Information Threshold, but then reconverge.

Child maltreatment is one context in which changes to a child’s care and living arrangements, introduced when a child is placed in foster care, could actively improve a child’s wellbeing. In this study, I analyze a nationally representative sample of child welfare-involved youth to examine whether the association between foster care and instability in care and living arrangements is driven by children’s placement in foster care or by the selectivity of foster youth. I find that compared to children who do not enter foster care, those who do are more likely to experience change in their primary caregiver, availability of a secondary caregiver, and their living arrangement. When I treat the initial transition into foster care as necessary, excluding it from my measures of change, foster care appears to stabilize the structures of children’s care arrangements, while their constitutive relationships remain substantially less so.

In the presence of such confounders, the natural direct and indirect effects of treatment on the outcome, into which the total effect can be additively decomposed, are not identified. An alternative but similar set of effects, known as randomized intervention analogues to the natural direct effect (R-NDE) and the natural indirect effect (R-NIE), can still be identified in this situation, but existing estimators for these effects require a complicated weighting procedure that is difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new method for estimating the R-NDE and R-NIE that involves only a minor adaption of the comparatively simple regression methods used to perform effect decomposition in the absence of treatment-induced confounding. It involves fitting linear models for (a) the conditional mean of the mediator given treatment and a set of baseline confounders and (b) the conditional mean of the outcome given the treatment, mediator, baseline confounders, and the treatment-induced confounders after first residualizing them with respect to the observed past. The R-NDE and R-NIE are simple functions of the parameters in these models when they are correctly specified and when there are no unobserved variables that confound the treatment-outcome, treatment-mediator, or mediator-outcome relationships. We illustrate the method by decomposing the effect of education on depression symptoms at midlife into components operating through income versus alternative factors.

Despite significant, longstanding attention in geographical problems, recent advances in non-linear techniques for dimension reduction, called manifold learning, have not been adopted in classic data-intensive geographical problems. More generally, machine learning methods for geographical problems often focus more on applying standard machine learning algorithms to geographic data, rather than applying true ""spatially-correlated learning,"" in the words of Kohonen. As such, we suggest a general way to incentivize geographical learning in machine learning algorithms, and link it to many past methods that introduced geography into statistical techniques. We develop a specific instance of this by specifying two geographical variants of Isomap, a non-linear dimension reduction, or ""manifold learning,"" technique. We also provide a method for assessing what is added by incorporating geography and estimate the manifold's intrinsic geographic scale. To illustrate the concepts and provide interpretable results, we conducting a dimension reduction on geographical and high-dimensional structure of social and economic data on Brooklyn, New York.

At the heart of the commercial success of recommendation algorithms is their ability to make an accurate prediction of a target person’s preferences for previously unseen items. Can these algorithms also be used to predict which health messages an individual will evaluate favorably, and thereby provide effective tailored communication to the person? Although there is evidence that message tailoring enhances persuasion, little research has examined the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms for tailored health interventions aimed at promoting behavior change. We developed a message tailoring algorithm to select smoking-related public service announcements (PSAs) for smokers, and experimentally test its effectiveness in predicting a target smoker’s evaluations of PSAs and encouraging smoking cessation. The tailoring algorithm was constructed using multiple levels of data on smokers’ PSA rating history, individual differences, content features of the PSAs, and other smokers’ PSA ratings. We conducted a longitudinal online experiment to examine its efficacy in comparison to two non-tailored methods: “best in show” (choosing messages most preferred by other smokers) and “off the shelf” (random selection from eligible ads). The results showed that the tailoring algorithm produced more accurate predictions of smokers’ message evaluations than the simple-average method used for the “best in show” approach. Smokers who viewed PSAs recommended by the tailoring algorithm were more likely than those receiving a random set to evaluate the PSAs favorably and quit smoking. There was no significant difference between the “best in show” and “off the shelf” methods in message assessment and quitting behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,health communication|message tailoring|Recommendation algorithms,2019-05-16T02:57:27.503724,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-16T02:57:06.254579,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,JOSEPH Cappella,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/citation/,nu6tg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdc18aadb3c0a0019d1054b/,5cdc18aadb3c0a0019d1054b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nu6tg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nu6tg,NA

To fill this gap, computational observation offers a novel approach—the unobtrusive and automated collection of information encountered within algorithmically curated media environments by means of a browser plug-in. In contrast to prior methodological approaches, browser plug-ins allow for reliable capture and repetitive analysis of both content and context at the point of the actual user encounter. After discussing the technological, ethical, and practical considerations relevant to this automated solution, we present our open-source browser plug-in as an element in an adequate multi-method design, along with potential links to panel surveys and content analysis. Ultimately, we present a proof-of-concept study in the realm of news exposure on Facebook; we successfully deployed the plug-in to Chrome and Firefox, and we combined the computational observation with a two-wave panel survey. Although this study suffered from severe recruitment difficulties, the results indicate that the methodological setup is reliable and ready to implement for data collection within a variety of studies on media use and media effects.",TRUE,FALSE,browser plug-in|computational communication science|computational methods|data collection|Facebook|media use|observation|preprint|social media,2019-05-16T02:56:51.718309,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-16T02:56:29.764197,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/citation/,xd63n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdc15eb2d1b9e001ca3e858/,5cdc15eb2d1b9e001ca3e858,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xd63n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xd63n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xd63n,NA

Beyond this discourse, there was also a mass-based discourse—I label it “Socialism” to signal continuity with my topography of Britishness in 1950—that criticized Britain for its inherent elitism and excessive respect for inherited wealth.

Family Background and Academic Performance in Germany, Norway, and the United States","Research on educational mobility usually fails to consider variation in the association between social origin and academic performance across the distribution of children’s academic performance. However, theories of social mobility as well as theories about resource allocation within families predict such variation. We use quantile regression models to estimate variations in the associations between different indicators of family background (parental education, occupation, earnings, and wealth) and children’s educational performance across the performance distribution. We apply this approach to data on Germany, Norway, and the United States, three countries that represent different kinds of welfare and education regimes that may affect the intergenerational transmission of educational advantage. We find a stronger association between family background and academic performance at the bottom than in the middle and the weakest association at the top of the performance distribution. These findings are virtually identical across all four indicators of family background. We also find no cross-national differences in the variation of the association between family background and academic performance across the performance distribution.",TRUE,FALSE,academic performance|cross-national comparison|education|quantile regression|social mobility,2019-05-16T02:55:07.754622,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-16T02:54:30.599666,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/citation/,n6cgk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nmj5q/,nmj5q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdc0a83db3c0a0016d210cd/,5cdc0a83db3c0a0016d210cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6cgk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n6cgk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n6cgk,NA
