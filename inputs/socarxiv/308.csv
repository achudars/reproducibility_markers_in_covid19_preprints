On the Evolution of Income Composition Inequality in Italy 1989-2016,"We study the evolution of inequality in income composition in terms of capital and labor income in Italy between 1989 and 2016. We document a rise in the share of capital income accruing to the bottom of the distribution, whilst the top of the distribution increases its share of labor income. This implies a falling degree of income composition inequality in the period considered and, hence, the fact that Italy is moving away from being an economy composed of poor laborers and rich capitalists. This result is robust to the use of different definitions of capital and labor income. A falling degree of income composition inequality implies a weaker link between the functional and personal distributions of income. Therefore, fluctuations in the total factor shares of income are having an increasingly weaker impact on income inequality in Italy. Finally, we conceptualize a rule of thumb for policy makers seeking to reduce income inequality in the long run. This rule relates fluctuations in the total factor shares and the level of income composition inequality to the specific income source to be redistributed.

However, their implications in policy application usually remain superficial and fail to fully exploit state-of-the-art resources which digital era holds for text analysis. This paper illustrates the potential of deep-narrative analysis in energy policy research using text analysis tools from the cutting-edge domain of computational social sciences, notably topic modelling. We argue that a nested application of topic modelling and grounded theory in narrative analysis promises advances in areas where manual-coding driven narrative analysis has traditionally struggled with directionality biases, scaling, systematisation and repeatability. The nested application of the topic model and the grounded theory goes beyond the frequentist approach of narrative analysis and introduces insight generation capabilities based on the probability distribution of words and topics in a text corpus. In this manner, our proposed methodology deconstructs the corpus and enables the analyst to answer research questions based on the foundational element of the text data structure. We verify the theoretical and epistemological fit of the proposed nested methodology through a meta-analysis of a state-of-the-art bibliographic database on energy policy and computational social science. We find that the nested application contributes to the literature gap on the need for multidisciplinary polyvalence methodologies that can systematically include qualitative evidence into policymaking.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|energy policy|methodological framework|narratives|text analysis|topic modelling,2020-03-27T12:33:47.566574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-27T12:33:25.145988,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/citation/,hvcb5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7c67197190ce005893e112/,5e7c67197190ce005893e112,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hvcb5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hvcb5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hvcb5,NA

There is currently no gold-standard definition or method for identifying suicide clusters, resulting in considerable heterogeneity in the types of suicide clusters that are detected.  This study sought to identify the characteristics, mechanisms, and parameters of suicide clusters using three cluster detection methods.  Specifically, the study aimed to: 1) determine the overlap in suicide clusters among each method; 2) compare the spatial and temporal parameters associated with different suicide clusters; and 3) identify the demographic characteristics and rates of exposure to suicide among cluster and non-cluster members.
Methods: 
Suicide data were obtained from the National Coronial Information System. N=3027 Australians, aged 10-24 who died by suicide in 2006-2015 were included. Suicide clusters were determined using: 1) poisson scan statistics; 2) a systematic search of coronial inquests; and 3) descriptive network analysis. These methods were chosen to operationalise three different definitions of suicide clusters, namely clusters that are: 1) statistically significant; 2) perceived to be significant; and 3) characterised by social links among three or more suicide descendents. For each method, the demographic characteristics and rates of exposure to suicide were identified, in addition to the maximum duration of suicide clusters, the geospatial overlap between suicide clusters, and the overlap of individual cluster members. 
Results: 
Eight suicide clusters (69 suicides) were identified from the scan statistic, seven (40 suicides) from coronial inquests; and 11 (37 suicides) from the descriptive network analysis. Of the eight clusters detected using the scan statistic, two overlapped with clusters detected using the descriptive network analysis and one with clusters identified from coronial inquests. Of the seven clusters from coronial inquests, four overlapped with clusters from the descriptive network analysis and one with clusters from the scan statistic. Overall, 9.2% (12 suicides) of individuals were identified by more than one method. Prior exposure to suicide was 10.1% (N=7) in clusters from the scan statistic; 32.5% (N=13) in clusters from coronial inquest; and 56.8% (N=21) in clusters from the descriptive network analysis.
Conclusion: 
Each method identified markedly different suicide clusters. Evidence of social links between cluster members was largely limited to clusters detected using the descriptive network analysis. However, these data were limited to the availability information collected as part of the police and coroner investigation.  Communities tasked with detecting and responding to suicide clusters may benefit from using the spatial and temporal parameters revealed in descriptive studies to inform analyses of suicide clusters using inferential methods.",TRUE,FALSE,Adolescents|Clusters|Public health|Suicide|Suicide contagion|Youth,2020-03-29T02:08:01.719505,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-29T02:07:42.379866,FALSE,NA,no,Due to confidentiality restrictions data is only avialable through direct application with the NCIS,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/citation/,a6q3p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7c55fdc3f8d3004afa0143/,5e7c55fdc3f8d3004afa0143,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6q3p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6q3p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6q3p,NA

Despite several advances, these “cognitive cultural” concepts are drawn on selectively, and limited work has attempted to assemble them into a coherent framework, leading to conceptual murkiness and ambiguous use of terms like “schema.” This article synthesizes literature on culture and cognition to develop a conceptual model of four interrelated but distinct types of cultural knowledge beneath the level of explicit discourse. Drawing on emergence theories, the author theorizes how these types relate to each other, as well as to discourse and public culture. The utility of the model is then illustrated using the empirical case of American religious understandings. These types of cultural knowledge have distinct qualities and, consequently, distinct roles in influencing thought, speech, and action.

One approach theorizes that people actively update their beliefs and behaviors in the face of new information. The other argues that, following early socialization experiences, dispositions are stable. We formalize these two models, elaborate empirical implications of each, and derive a simple combined model for comparing them using panel data. We test this model on 183 attitude and behavior items from the 2006-14 rotating panels of the General Social Survey. Though the pattern of results is complex, it is somewhat more consistent with the settled dispositions model than the active updating model. Most observed change in the GSS appears to be short-term attitude change or measurement error rather than persisting changes. When persistent change occurs, it is somewhat more likely to occur in younger people than older people and more common for public behaviors and beliefs about high-profile issues than private attitudes.

The underlying mechanisms remain understudied. The “cognitive perspective” of group identiﬁcation oﬀers a possible explanation, but is tacit on exact causal pathways. We predict that indiscriminate violence by armed actors induces fear of future attacks which in turn leads to prejudice, enhanced in-group cohesion, and calls for segregation. Selective violence that yields a lower probability of aﬀecting bystanders does not contribute to fear and thereby does not foster prejudice, segregation, and cohesion. To test our predictions, we rely on large-scale, reimbursed, electronic panel surveys conducted in Nairobi and Mombasa during the violent Kenyan elections in the Summer of 2017.

The results of these surveys can be used to shape and evaluate policing policy and practice. Yet the extant evidence base is hampered when people use different methods and where there is no common data standard. In this paper we present a set of 13 core national indicators that can be used by police services across Canada to ensure measurement quality and draw proper comparisons between regions and over time. Having identified a set of 50 survey questions through an expert consultation process, we field those items on a quota sample of 2,500 Canadians. Our analysis of the subsequent data has three stages. First, we use confirmatory factor analysis to assess scale properties. Second, we use a form of substitutability analysis to identify 13 single indicators that ‘best stand in’ for each scale. Third, we use the set of 50 and the sub-set of 13 measures to test procedural justice theory for the first time in the Canadian context. Overall, those commissioning and managing public attitudes surveys can use the 13 core indicators as a conceptually-rich and empirically-validated tool through which to understand local survey data in the context of other municipal, provincial and national data.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|legitimacy|measurement|police|policing|procedural justice|trust,2020-03-24T18:25:45.691644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-24T18:25:19.200210,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/citation/,fea62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7a2205d2927f003edd5d48/,5e7a2205d2927f003edd5d48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fea62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fea62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fea62,NA

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated that, in times of need, the global research community can activate and pool its knowledge and resources to collaborate on solving problems. The use of innovative Web-based technologies, including open source software, data-sharing archives, open collaboration methods, and the liberation of thousands of relevant research articles from proprietary sources show us that the fundamental components of a fully open system are readily available, technologically efficient and cost-effective. If we are to achieve the SDGs by 2030, systematic reform and explicit adoption of open scholarship strategies at scale is necessary. We propose that the United Nations and parallel entities take a position of leadership by creating or funding an organisation or federated alliance of organisations to implement these reforms.",TRUE,FALSE,Open Access|Open Data|Open Research|Open Science|Open Source|Scholarly Communication|Scholarly Publishing|Science Policy|Sustainable Agenda|Sustainable Development|United Nations,2020-03-24T18:26:05.473530,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-24T18:25:37.957029,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Information Literacy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/citation/,8yk62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7bycg/,7bycg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e79ce34d384390030cdddec/,5e79ce34d384390030cdddec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8yk62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8yk62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8yk62,NA
