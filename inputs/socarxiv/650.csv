From the observed variable of average income image, the latent income distribution images from which the observed average income image is supposed to be derived were estimated and differences in income distribution image by social position were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical models.
In the analysis, differences in income distribution image by age cohort and household income class were examined in terms of the mean and the Gini inequality coefficient of the distribution image. Consequently, it was found that although the distribution image tends to underestimate the average income level and overestimate inequality, the income distribution image could be an incomplete reflection of the income distribution characteristics of the reference group.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian hierarchical model|income distribution|inequality|reference group|social cognition,2018-07-02T11:22:48.353933,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-15T15:26:45.010301,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/citation/,jmvt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/argmq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/relationships/node/,argmq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a0bdb5eb83f69027311e4b7/,5a0bdb5eb83f69027311e4b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmvt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jmvt5/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244018774106,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jmvt5

This paper presents an exploratory analysis that reveals divergent and convergent themes across the initiatives to inform similar initiatives in the future. The SPUR initiative was the inspiration for both RWS and ORP. As such, an evolution of ideas is evident from the first initiative to the most recent. While the SPUR initiative was a model for the RWS and ORP initiatives, the process and outcomes of the latter two initiatives were more similar than to the original SPUR initiative. Major examples of this are the smaller scopes, as well as increased prominence and continued innovation of recovery-based performance measurement frameworks to help identify seismic resilience recommendations. The importance of this innovation is not clear, however, based on the small amount of explicit integration with the respective initiative definitions of resilience, goals and recommendations. More systematic research into elements of the SPUR, RWS, and ORP initiatives, such as development of the performance measurement frameworks, is warranted given the initiatives’ popularity and influence on the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Community Resilience Planning Guide.

This article hones in on the use of assessment regimes at the level of the European Union, particularly in the work of the Commission, to argue for a missing middle between technology assessment and impact assessment. Technology assessment focuses on the upstream governance of science and technology, while impact assessment focuses on the downstream governance of the impacts of specific policy options. What is missing is a form of midstream governance, which I label innovation assessment, to steer polities through periods of disruptive technological change, during which innovations have taken concrete forms and are beginning to diffuse, but still exhibit much scope for rapid, unexpected change and alternative trajectories of development.

Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"In light of ongoing debates that discuss the link between Muslim migration and terrorist attacks in various European cities, this paper investigates how attitudes toward (Muslim) immigrants have been affected by these attacks. We draw on a German student survey conducted immediately before and after the attacks in Paris in November 2015. The experimental vignette design allows us to further differentiate between attitudes toward Syrian migrants from different religious backgrounds. We show that the attitudes towards immigration held by students who identify with conservative parties became more negative after the attacks. Immigrants’ religion also plays an important role depending on whether the issue in question is a social or political one. The attitudes of liberal students are hardly affected. This paper goes beyond existing studies that only measure attitudes in the aftermath of such attacks and focuses on attitudes regarding policy responses to terrorist attacks or attitudes towards immigrants in general. We show that such attacks do not lead to negative attitudes in general; they mostly do so for people who attach great importance to issues of national security.

When treated improperly, such phenomenon may lead to biased estimates and incorrect inferences. This study extends the existing literature on single value inflated models, and develops a general framework to handle variables with more than one inflated values. To assess the performance of the proposed maximum likelihood estimator, we conducted Monte Carlo experiments under several scenarios for different levels of inflated probabilities under Multinomial, Ordinal, Poisson, and Zero-Truncated Poisson outcomes with covariates. We found that ignoring the inflations leads to substantial bias and poor inference if the inflations—not only for the intercept(s) of the inflated categories, but other coefficients as well. Specifically, higher values of inflated probabilities are associated with larger biases. By contrast, the Generalized Inflated Discrete models (GIDM) perform well with unbiased estimates and satisfactory coverages even when the number of parameters that need to be estimated is quite large. We showed that model fit criteria such as AIC could be used in selecting appropriate specification of inflated models. Lastly, GIDM was implemented to a large-scale health survey data to compare with conventional modeling approach such as various Poisson, and Ordered Logit models. We showed that GIDM fits the data better in general.

The purpose is to study loose adaptations of dramatic texts, especially those of Shakespeare, following cultural translation studies principles. The study has shown that it is satisfactorily feasible to use inter-lingual translation principles, across the spectrum from strictly literal to loose free, and apply them to the intra-lingual adaptation of dramatic texts, with the example of The Al-Hamlet Summit as a main reference.

It primarily focuses on metaphors in his fiction, which lend a unique sense of translingualism and multiculturalism to his work. Hosseini’s overt and covert use of metaphors reveals an allegiance to several languages that are spoken in Afghanistan and the region, including Pashto, Persian, Arabic and Urdu. His double cultural and discursive belonging suggests a case for post-structural translingualism, a fluid bilingualism belonging simultaneously to all the languages in one’s repertoire. These metaphors, along with his characteristic narrative and linguistic strategies, give Hosseini a unique linguistic persona. This study addresses, inter alia, the self-translating aspect of Hosseini as an author whose works remain marvels of interwoven languages and identities.",TRUE,FALSE,khaled hosseini|metaphor|multiculturalism|multilingualism|translingualism,2018-07-02T11:22:43.264141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T05:13:04.081039,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/citation/,v3wg7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9ekmw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/relationships/node/,9ekmw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07d7e46c613b0265ace753/,5a07d7e46c613b0265ace753,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3wg7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v3wg7/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v3wg7

The spread of MT entails a thorough analysis of translation produced by such translation systems. The present study evaluates the capacity of two MT systems-Google Translate and Microsoft Bing translator- in translation from   Arabic into English of Khalil Gibran’s literary masterpiece - The Prophet (2000).  The question that arises in the study is could we trust MT in the translation of literary masterpieces across languages and particularly from Arabic to English? How close does MT output to human translation? To conduct that, the study is adopted Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) of Papineni (2000).  MT output analysis showed that MT is not accurate, intelligible and natural in translating literary texts due to the difficulty of literary texts, as they are full of metaphors and cultural specifications. Besides, there are some linguistic errors: lexical, syntactic and misinformation. The study also found that both systems provided similar translation for the same input due to either the use of similar MT approach or learning from previous translated texts. Moreover, both systems in some instances, achieve good results at the word level, but bad results at collocation units. The study also showed that automatic translation is insufficient for providing a full analysis of MT output because all automatic metrics are misleading due to dependence on text similarity to a reference human translation. For future research, the study recommended conducting a correlative study that combines manual and automatic evaluation methods to ensure best analysis of MT output.

Precisely, this reflective analysis aims to discuss these two research questions: do foreign language teachers simply use some amateur translation activities to upgrade their learners’ linguistic proficiency? Or do they find it necessary to teach translation models and techniques proper, targeting translational proficiency along with linguistic ability? Drawing on the researcher’s experience and specialist authorship, translation approaches and techniques as related to foreign language teaching/learning and 2) translation pedagogy types that govern the appropriate selection of translation techniques are the foundational units of this analytic endeavour. This analysis revealed that the basics of most well-known translation approaches and techniques are genuinely present in diverse foreign language classes. Additionally, teaching these translation approaches and techniques for general linguistic aims and for specific professional purposes are two different contexts where the former is shaped by presenting some mere language-based translation techniques and the latter by teaching much more specialist and profession-related ones. This categorisation inescapably determines the quality and quantity of translation practice and the nature of the teacher-learner pedagogical contract, aiming at foreign language learning per se, translation proficiency or both. According to either context, teachers should be aware of translation basics or translation proper to avoid ad hoc instruction and ‘translationese.’",TRUE,FALSE,Foreign language teaching|translation approaches|translation pedagogy,2018-07-02T11:22:43.113767,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-12T05:05:46.077181,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/citation/,msjqw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k3dxm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/relationships/node/,k3dxm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a07d0849ad5a1026d02c68e/,5a07d0849ad5a1026d02c68e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msjqw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/msjqw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no4.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/msjqw
