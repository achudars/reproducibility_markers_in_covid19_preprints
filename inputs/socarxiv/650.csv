Private Governance in Brazil's Jogo do Bicho,"This article presents a rational choice account of Brazil's jogo do bicho ('animal game'), possibly the largest illegal lottery game in the world. In over 120 years, the jogo do bicho has grown from a local raffle to a multimillion-dollar business, and the game has played a major role in Brazil's cultural and political life. My analysis of the jogo do bicho has three goals. First, I examine the mechanisms that fostered the lottery's notable growth outside the boundaries of Brazilian law. Second, I investigate how the animal game financiers combine costly signals and selective incentives to induce cooperation from members of the community. Lastly, I discuss the relationship between the lottery sponsors and Brazilian representatives, particularly how the bicheiros exploit the fragmentation of Brazil's political system to advance their long-term interests.

This study aims at investigating some translation strategies used to translate food menus from English into Arabic and the salient linguistic and cultural problems resulted fromthe usage of such inappropriate strategies. This study  the focuses the translation strategies used to translate food menus in 10 restaurants and coffee shops in Muscat, Oman and the problems which resulted from the usage of such strategies and what could be suggested to help translation practitioners to handle such challenges. The selection of the corpus was based on practical reasons. The data was analysed descriptively by using frequencies and percentages. The findings revealed that there was a number of translation strategies used frequently to translate food menus in the corpus in questions which are: borrowing, literal translation, using a super ordinate word, amplification, reduction and using a load word plus an explanation respectively. The usage of these strategies caused several problems such as lexical ambiguity, lack of clarity and confusion.

And how is the translator’s appraisal reflected in the target texts? 3) What are the differences between the source text producer’s appraisal and the translator’s appraisal? 4) What are the possible reasons for the translator to choose his/her appraisal and produce “unfaithful” translations? In order to anwer these questions, five Chinese public notices and their English translations which were mainly collected in Hong Kong and Macao are investigated in the present study. The source and target texts are analyzed with the Appraisal theory and then compared to find out their respective appraisal. The findings show that for both Attitude and Engagement parts, the appraisal between source texts and target texts is rather different. Some possible motivations are then explored.

In the backdrop of this, this paper aims to demonstrate how analytical dimension of literary studies can be expanded by involving Grice’s (1975) pragmatic stylistic theory of Cooperative Priciple (CP) and explores how the fictional discourses could be better understood by reconstructing inferential chains of interpretation along with various issues of inferences in the dialogic discourses of the characters from Vikram Seth’s magnum opus A Suitable Boy (ASB). The CP contributes to contextualization of the text; provides interpretative possibilities that explain how we draw inferences from conversation; and hints to interpretations of how direct and indirect discourses are manipulated in literary works of fiction. The major findings of this paper suggest that the real value and richness of conversational maxims of Grice lie not in observing but in flouting them and that the major motivation for violating the requirements of these maxims are related to characters’ socio-cultural concerns such as politeness, tact, social power and taboos and also to the inter-personal factors like various cross-purposes, attitudes, personal tensions, conflicts, etc. Arriving at pragmatic meanings through the maxims of CP involves effort and increases engagement with the text; therefore, the author strongly recommends that pragmatic stylistic analysis be frequently included as an important pedagocial activity of studying fictional discourses in the teaching of language and literature.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:48:34.324794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:52:26.157000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/citation/,e2vgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rjhhb/,rjhhb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb78edb83f6901f9929321/,58cb78edb83f6901f9929321,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2vgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2vgs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2vgs,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no1.12

I argue that by borrowing the story of Mary Shelley’s monster in Frankenstein, Saadawi manages to pinpoint the roots of the terrorism that has plagued Iraq since the American occupation. Terrorism emanates from fear. Fear is the monster that has been unleashed by the collapse of central authority which resulted in what Judith Butler has called ‘a precarious life’ in which sudden and violent death is always looming. In addition, the struggle for power among the new players in the Iraqi scene leads to selfishness, demagogy, and exploitation. The novel stresses the need to acknowledge that no one is free of blame. By acknowledging that that nobody is purely a victim or a victimizer, and by taking responsibility for one’s deed, there might be hope for a way out of the horrors of the civil strife and carnage.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic fiction|Frankenstein in Baghdad|Saadawi|Terrorism in Iraq,2018-07-02T10:46:23.644596,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:48:12.584000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/citation/,53y9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6kec2/,6kec2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb77f8594d9001fa8abb0f/,58cb77f8594d9001fa8abb0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53y9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/53y9k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/53y9k,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no1.11

It also aims to clarify the evident confusion in understanding the categories of tense and aspect, particularly in languages that are as divergent as Arabic and English. In order to achieve these objectives, the researcher analyzed, compared, and explained examples drawn from selected chapters from Jonathan Wright’s (2009) English translation of Youssef Ziedan’s (2008) novel Azazeel. The researcher followed a descriptive analytical approach and, with the use of the quantitative approach, individually analyzed the English translations of the Arabic aspectual forms from Scrolls (chapters) One, Fourteen, and Twenty-four. The results of the study revealed that Wright’s (2009) English equivalents of the Arabic aspectual forms in Azazeel were mostly accurate. The findings also showed through Wright’s (2009) translation that there is not a standard approach to translate Arabic aspectual forms.",TRUE,FALSE,aspect|imperfect|Modern Standard Arabic|perfect|tense|time,2018-07-02T10:45:09.268383,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:40:14.556000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/citation/,2syyn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xx4ks/,xx4ks,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb76226c613b0200ed828f/,58cb76226c613b0200ed828f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2syyn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2syyn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2syyn,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no1.9

The researcher adopted the corpus-based approach suggested by Deignan (1995) and collected the maximum number of English and Arabic food metaphorical expressions to construct the linguistic corpus for the study. The analysis of the data was carried out for the English and Arabic languages individually following the Conceptual Metaphor Theory. The aim is to come up with a simple classification that facilitated the process of comparison between English and Arabic metaphorical expressions. The findings of the study revealed that English and Arabic share the same major food conceptualization within their scheme, namely: IDEAS ARE FOOD, TEMPERAMENT IS FOOD, GOING THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE ISTASTING IT AND GAINING MONEY UNLAWFULLY IS DEVOURING IT. Nevertheless, such conceptualizations are not equally conventionalized in the two languages due to differences between the Arabic and the western cultures.",TRUE,FALSE,conceptual metaphortheory|contrastive study|metaphorical mapping|source domain|target domain.,2018-07-02T10:53:47.788250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-17T05:36:19.435000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/citation/,wcg39,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p8ezg/,p8ezg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58cb7541b83f6901fe929313/,58cb7541b83f6901fe929313,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcg39/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wcg39/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wcg39,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no1.8
