We use 35 years of restricted geo-coded NLSY 1979 and NLSY Children and Young Adults data to estimate the association between multigenerational exposure to childhood neighborhood disadvantage and subsequent adult exposure. Invoking cousin fixed effects models that adjust for unobserved legacies of disadvantage that cascade across generations, we find that families where both parents and their children are exposed to childhood neighborhood disadvantage are likely to pass on the legacy of neighborhood disadvantage to successive generations, net of observed and unobserved confounders. Second, we find a direct intergenerational neighborhood association, net of observed and unobserved confounders. Third, we find that unobserved confounders nested in previous generations explain away the intragenerational neighborhood association.

Alaskan salmonids are anadromous, meaning they live most of their lives at sea, only to return to the river in which they were spawned to reproduce— this makes them a reliable seasonal resource in this environmentally marginal subarctic landscape. Salmonids form a major part of the subsistence lifestyle of modern Native Alaskans, and archaeological evidence suggests that their ancestors experienced population booms and cultural shifts coinciding with the adoption of mass fishing techniques. This was done primarily in response to climate changes, and to sustain burgeoning populations. Analyses of salmonid behavioural patterns are therefore crucial for understanding the lifeways of past peoples in Southwest Alaska. This work outlines a GIS-based methodology for processing an open spatial dataset— the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s Anadromous Waters Catalog (AWC)— to make it suitable for use in archaeological and anthropological research. AWC shapefiles converted in this manner may be used to identify the most ecologically diverse (and, therefore, productive) anadromous waterways, and the relationship between heritage site distribution and salmon activity along the length of rivers. As a pilot study, we discuss the cultural landscape of the Yup’ik community of Quinhagak in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta, and its two active salmon streams— the Agalig (Arolik) and Qanirtuuq (Kanektok) Rivers. There appears to be a strong relationship between the presence of cultural sites associated with fishing (both historic and archaeological) near the mouths of both rivers where the salmon runs begin (the “initial lower course”, or, “ILC”). It also highlights the importance of such rivers as highways to access non-salmonid resources further inland, including hunting and plant harvesting areas. This methodology has a strong potential for assisting in the survey and characterisation of heritage sites elsewhere in Southwest Alaska.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|GIS|Open Data|salmon|Yup'ik,2021-05-26T13:24:22.754693,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:24:03.769973,FALSE,NA,no,Cultural site location is for the Quinhagak area is only available from Qanirtuuq Inc. upon application.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology",Jonathan S.

In doing so, they face obstacles in the systemic nature of innovation processes, the uncertain and ambiguous nature of sustainability, and in reconciling their business model and strategy with social and environmental value creation. This is particularly the case for those trying to emulate the so-called ‘Silicon Valley model’, which prioritises speed to deliver on its ambitious socially significant mission, relies on high-risk venture capital financing, and encourages flexibility and curiosity on the part of employees. This article uses data gathered during an action research case study to explore whether this much vaunted model could be better aligned with sustainable development. While, in this case, we find systemic and cognitive challenges to be currently precluding concerted action on sustainability, we also identify opportunities for greater alignment.

Point-of-care tests (POCTs) to diagnose sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have potential to positively impact patient management and patient perceptions of clinical services. Yet there remains a disconnect between development of new technologies and their implementation into clinical care. With the advent of new STI POCTs arriving to the global market, guidance for their successful adoption and implementation into clinical services is urgently needed. 

METHODS
We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with professionals prior to and post-implementation of a Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae POCT into clinical services in England to define key stakeholder roles and explore the process of POCT integration. Participants self-identified themselves as key stakeholders in the STI POCT adoption and/or implementation processes. Data consisted of interview transcripts, which were analysed thematically using NVIVO 11. 

RESULTS
Six sexual health services were included in the study; three of which have implemented POCTs. We conducted 40 total interviews; 31 prior to POCT implementation; 9 post-implementation. Post-implementation data showed that implementation plans required little or no change during service evaluation. Lead clinicians and managers self-identified as key stakeholders for the decision to purchase, while nurses self-identified as “change champions” for implementation. Many identified senior clinical staff as those most likely to introduce and drive change. However, participants stressed the importance of engaging all clinical staff in implementation. While the accuracy of the POCT, its positive impact on patient management and the ease of its integration within existing pathways were considered essential, costs of purchasing and utilising the technology were identified as central to the decision to purchase. 

CONCLUSION 
Our study shows that key decision-makers for adoption and implementation require STI POCTs to have laboratory-comparable accuracy and be affordable for purchase and ongoing use.  Further, successful integration of POCTs into sexual health services relies on supportive interpersonal relationships between all levels of staff.",TRUE,FALSE,diagnostics|health services|point-of-care test|sexual health|STIs,2021-05-26T13:18:24.334500,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:17:26.298964,TRUE,"ADREU has received funding from binx health, Alere, Cepheid, SpeedDx, Mologic, Revolugen and Sekisui.

Regression discontinuity and qualitative analyses of four civil wars in India find that in localities where aligned status quo parties won elections, overall voter turnout significantly declined in subsequent election cycles and can be explained by rebels and state security forces intensifying their operations in these areas.

To test whether demographic variation in vaccine hesitancy can be explained by differences in trust and healthcare experiences.

Design
Cross-sectional study.

Setting
Data collected online by Ipsos MORI in April 2021.

Participants
Data collected from 4885 UK-resident adults, of whom 3223 had received the invitation to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. The remainder were excluded. 1629 included participants identified as female and 1594 as male. 234 identified as belonging to other than white ethnic groups while 2967 identified as belonging to white ethnic groups.

Primary and secondary outcome measures
Uptake of coronavirus vaccination.

Results
Membership of an other than white ethnic group (AOR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.35, 0.84], p = .005) and age (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI [1.39, 1.87], p &lt; .001 for a 1 SD change from the mean) were the only statistically significant demographic predictors of vaccine uptake. After controls for NHS healthcare experiences and trust in government, scientists, and medical professionals, the effect associated with membership of an other than white ethnic group appears more marginal (AOR = 0.61, 95% CI [0.38, 1.01], p = .046), while the effect associated with age remains virtually unchanged. Exploratory analysis suggests that NHS healthcare experiences mediate 24% (95% CI [8%, 100%], p = .024) of the association between ethnicity and uptake, while trust mediates 94% (95% CI [56%, 100%], p .001) of the association between NHS healthcare experiences and uptake.

Conclusions
Members of other than white ethnic groups report inferior NHS healthcare experiences, which may explain the lower trust that they report in government, scientists, and medical professionals. However, this does not fully explain the ethnic gap in coronavirus vaccination uptake.

Trial registration

The sample was large, providing high statistical power, and was designed for representativeness of the UK adult population 

Standard measures of trust and healthcare experiences were used, providing confidence that these variables have been measured robustly 

However, it was not possible to obtain a probability sample, and there was limited representation within the sample both of people who did not take up the invitation to be vaccinated and of members of other than white ethnic groups",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|Ethnicity|Experiences of healthcare|Inequality|Public health|SARS-CoV-2|Trust|Vaccination|Vaccine hesitancy,2021-05-26T13:16:03.404144,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:15:19.589542,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available following the conclusion of the project's period of funding.,,available,NA,https://osf.io/dfr3m,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Daniel Allington|Siobhan McAndrew|Bobby Duffy|Vivienne Moxham-Hall,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/citation/,9vaeq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ac36da8a5d3d02490cf61f/,60ac36da8a5d3d02490cf61f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vaeq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9vaeq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9vaeq

Yet there is little scientific knowledge about what specific attitudes motivate specific groups to resist the vaccine. In this study we surveyed 2569 participants about their vaccine-related intentions. Results show that Republican women, not Republican men, are over-represented in the group that never intends to be vaccinated. Such women have concerns about safety, side-effects, and effectiveness of the vaccine. Republican women are also anxious about DNA alteration. Discounting sex and party, resistant participants’ greatest concerns include speed of production, trust of the vaccine, and trust of government. These results suggest specific, targeted messaging is needed to overcome these concerns.",TRUE,FALSE,SARS-CoV-2|strategic messaging|vaccine hesitancy,2021-05-26T13:12:41.609261,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:12:08.977896,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available on acceptance/publication.,,no,The study was not preregistered.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/citation/,vqugw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ac0f9e8a5d3d02480c7cae/,60ac0f9e8a5d3d02480c7cae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqugw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vqugw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vqugw

Instead of declaring what path critical GIS should take, I instead argue that we do not know what GIS can do. I suggest that we hold a place for doubt and unknowing, acknowledging that the potentials and possibilities of GIS do not preexist practice, but rather, critical GIS emerges in the doing and practice of GIS. Following this argument, I make three main claims in the article. First, I argue that understanding the possibilities for GIS requires being attentive to how particular instantiations of GIS connect with social and material relations. Second, I argue that the doing of critical GIS might use these existing limitations as a starting point for the
remaking of GIS. Third, I argue that the doing of critical GIS has an important role to play in understanding how GIS is used within infrastructures of governance. I conclude by suggesting that the doing of critical GIS takes meaningful form through experimentation, openness to the encounter, and linking with existing situated practices and theories.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithmic governance|community geographies|geographical imagination systems|GIS|speculative computing,2021-05-26T13:12:05.628122,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:11:12.591670,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,Nick Lally,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/citation/,5mj7p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ac0975a480c6021f0d4982/,60ac0975a480c6021f0d4982,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5mj7p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5mj7p/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5mj7p
