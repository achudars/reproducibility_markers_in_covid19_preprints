Citizen Responses to Surveillance,"How does state surveillance influence citizens’ willingness to express political and social opinions? This article theorizes about different citizen responses to surveillance which fall on what we term the evasion-deception spectrum, including preference falsification, self-censorship, and opting-out. We present the results from an empirical exploration of these responses, drawing on an online survey experiment conducted in Japan. In our survey, we use a novel experimental stimulus to assess whether individuals engage in different forms of evasion and deception when plausibly under government surveillance. The study finds that citizens are substantially more likely to opt-out of sharing their opinions (by exiting a survey) when reminded of their government’s capacity for monitoring. This occurs even when it implies a monetary cost (forfeiting payment for the survey) and even in a fully consolidated democracy, where freedoms of speech and opinion are legally codified.

Three empirical findings emerge: first, over this period, riots went from being an autonomous tactic to one which was largely subordinated to other protest logics; second, the way rioters chose their targets changed: instead of targeting individuals with whom rioters had concrete relationships, they started targeting people as tokens of some wider type; third, throughout this period rioting was a localised practice which reflected local traditions and dynamics.

Contextual Mobility and Neighborhood Attainment among Norwegian Immigrant Descendants,"We study contextual mobility and neighborhood attainment among immigrant descendants using administrative data from Norway. We find that immigrant descendants often remain in adult neighborhood contexts—characterized by relative economic disadvantage and comparatively few native-origin residents—that largely resemble their childhood neighborhoods. Intergenerational stability is strongest among descendants of immigrants from Pakistan, the Middle East, and Africa. Further, group-level differences in individual socioeconomic attainment, family background, and characteristics of their childhood neighborhoods account for a substantial part of the adult native-immigrant gaps in neighborhood-level economic composition, but less so for neighborhood-level proximity to native-origin residents. The role of childhood residential segregation is most important in accounting for adult native-immigrant gaps in neighborhood attainment. Our findings offer only partial support for spatial assimilation theory—which predicts that acculturation and socioeconomic progress will lead to a convergence in neighborhood profiles relative to natives across immigrant generations—but may reflect external barriers in the housing market or persistent in-group preferences for (co-ethnic) immigrant neighbors.",TRUE,FALSE,Administrative data|Contextual mobility|Immigrant assimilation|Immigration|Intergenerational mobility|Neighborhood attainment|Norway|Residential segregation,2020-02-26T17:41:46.335110,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T17:41:18.718110,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/citation/,mrjuv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96zdy/,96zdy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e563d8935d22d02c55f1f81/,5e563d8935d22d02c55f1f81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrjuv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrjuv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrjuv,NA

However, due to time and resource limitations, conducting longitudinal, large-scale experiments testing outcomes of interventions in authentic settings is difficult. Here, we introduce the deep learning method as a way to address this issue and illustrate the use of the deep learning method for the prediction of intervention outcomes through a MATLAB implementation. The presented deep learning method extracts predictable patterns from an empirical dataset to simulate large-scale intervention outcomes. Findings from our simulations suggest that the deep learning applied simulation model can predict intervention outcomes significantly more accurately compared to the traditional regression analysis methods.",TRUE,FALSE,computer simulation|deep learning|educational intervention|machine learning|neural network|outcome prediction|policy-making,2020-02-26T17:39:00.884186,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T17:38:47.661234,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/citation/,xs2n8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e559ea235d22d02695f58f7/,5e559ea235d22d02695f58f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xs2n8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xs2n8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xs2n8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-020-0075-z

However, the data collected are often challenging to work with, particularly with digitization and visualization. After reviewing these challenges, this article introduces a “semi-structured” approach to sketch map data collection, digitization, and analysis as well as an open source software package, “qualmap,” that implements tools for digitizing these data in the programming language R. This approach retains the cartographically accurate base maps used in other sketch map research. However, it superimposes an areal unit of the researchers’ choice to aid in digitization and analysis. This use of a standard areal unit opens up additional cartographic and analytic possibilities with sketch map data. After describing this approach and the accompanying software, this article illustrates its applicability with a sample project that analyzes perceptions of space collected from a convenience sample of college students. The resulting maps’ clustering identifies the presence of a “bubble” around their campus that captures much of the travel activity students engage in every week. These data are paired with crime data, which illustrates possible mixed methods extensions of this “semi-structured” approach to sketch mapping.",TRUE,FALSE,cities|crime|open source software|qualitative GIS|sketch mapping,2020-02-26T17:38:21.611971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T17:38:12.962206,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/citation/,p9qn5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pxzuc/,pxzuc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5598f535d22d027a5f44b9/,5e5598f535d22d027a5f44b9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9qn5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p9qn5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p9qn5,NA

The OECD PISA Policy Advisor Network in the Global Field of Power.,"The OECD is one of the key players in global education policy advice, informing education governance reforms around the globe with the PISA test. At the same time, it is part of the edu-business network comprised of companies, philanthropies, consulting agencies and think tanks profiting from educational governance reforms and large-scale testing. In order to exert influence on national educational reforms, different types of complementary expertise and collaborations between different types of actors must be coordinated. To analyze this form of collaboration between different actors and to map the global edu-business and global policy advisor networks having emerged around the OECD’s PISA-tests, we make use of a combination of Habitus-Field Theory and Social Network Theory. We introduce the concepts of boundary-spanning actors and field-transcending social capital and apply our concepts to a two-level network analysis to investigate the embeddedness of the OECD in different social fields and the global field of power. The first layer is based on official collaborations among organizational actors situated in different sectors of the field of power. The second layer comprises of individual collaborations such as scientific cooperation, board interlocks and multiple affiliations. Furthermore, we look at network closure and density to investigate the exclusion of competing actors from taking part in the global edu-business. Our findings indicate that the OECD draws on experts and actors located in different fields to exert influence on national educational reforms. Finally, the global network of policy advisors is able to coordinate the different forms of expertise by installing a system of patronage, consisting of a small number of key players and large numbers of organizations and individuals that are needed to set education reforms in motion but are excluded from the core of the collaboration network.",TRUE,FALSE,Bourdieu|Field-Transgressing Social Capital|Global Edu-Business|Global Field of Power|Habitus-Fieldtheory|OECD|Pisa|Social Network Analysis,2020-02-26T17:37:49.369710,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-26T17:37:14.515512,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/citation/,ahpfw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e550f9435d22d023d5f223c/,5e550f9435d22d023d5f223c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahpfw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ahpfw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ahpfw,NA
