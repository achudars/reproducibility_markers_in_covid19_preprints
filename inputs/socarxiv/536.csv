Pundits have argued that this performance can be attributed to the effect of the new leadership of Matteo Salvini, who shifted the ideological location of the party (that now aims at being a national right-wing party), combined with the drop in preferences of Forza Italia, the ally/competitor in the right-wing ideological spectrum. This paper aims at providing new insights in the explanation of these electoral outcomes, by hypothesizing that geographical trajectories of diffusion of the party are correlated with the presence of geographically clustered post-fascist minorities present in the region since the First Republic age. By employing official figures at the municipality level, the paper analyses the relationship between the percentages of votes for the MSI (the most relevant post-fascist force during the First Republic) in 1976 and the Lega Nord in the 2006-2018 period. Consistent with our hypothesis, the post-fascist inheritance is significantly correlated with the local prevalence for the Lega Nord in 2018, after the change in the political discourse and leadership of the party.

Yet, ‘cutting the face’ (breaking truces) remains an alternative, one often facilitated by new technologies that allow people to challenge pre-existing structures of communication and authority.

In particular, we focus on commonly used neutrality tests and discuss the interpretation of their results. We argue that one needs to be careful with interpreting the consistency (or inconsistency) of archaeological data with theoretical  neutral expectations as evidence for the absence (or presence) of selective force in the population. While neutral theory does very well in replicating various population-level frequency patterns, many alternative processes of cultural transmission  may do so, too, making the pattern-matching approach a fairly weak approach for inferring underlying transmission processes. We advocate the use of generative inference frameworks as one possibility to go beyond the hypothesis testing approach. These frameworks do not only allow for the identification of the most likely underlying learning process given the empirical data but for a description of the breath of processes that could have produced these data equally well.  This brings us a step closer to understanding the limits to inferring underlying transmission processes from population-level frequency data and therefore the kinds of questions can be answered with which kinds of data.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Cultural change|Cultural Transmission|Equifinality|Generative Inference Framework|Social Learning|Wright-Fisher Model,2018-10-11T00:56:01.608482,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-11T00:55:52.620966,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/citation/,kvmzu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qfprx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/relationships/node/,qfprx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbdba95ec292c00192cf88d/,5bbdba95ec292c00192cf88d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvmzu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kvmzu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kvmzu,NA

Through a content analysis of the top-five digital-native and top-five legacy press online news entities from 2014 to 2015, we investigate the dynamics of intermedia agenda-setting in the context of transgender topics, both at the level of attention to transgender topics in general and at the level of attention to specific issues related to the transgender community (e.g., anti-transgender violence). Results indicate significant causal effects of digital-native coverage on legacy press coverage at the level of general attention to transgender topics. However, results also indicate that at the level of specific transgender issues, digital-native coverage drives legacy press coverage on some issues, which legacy press coverage drives digital-native coverage on others. Implications for intermedia agenda-setting in the digital news media environment and for the future of transgender political rights movements are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,agenda-setting|content analysis|digital journalism|Granger causality|intermedia|transgender,2018-10-10T02:13:21.503878,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-10T02:12:39.883083,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",Western Political Science Association,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/citation/,9m3gz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cf68q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/relationships/node/,cf68q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbd07cf0463cb0018ccf6b6/,5bbd07cf0463cb0018ccf6b6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9m3gz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9m3gz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9m3gz,https://doi.org/10.1080/21565503.2018.1532302

Modern libraries are so large-often containing millions of books or articles-that the technical resources needed to work with them can be immense. Beginning researchers and students often cannot practically obtain more than a few thousand books at a time. Advanced researchers must use (often incomplete) metadata to decide which books are of interest for their projects; and libraries themselves lack ways for make their full-text holdings easily discoverable by researchers or integrated with other collections.,TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-10T02:16:20.906586,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-10T02:15:36.416951,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/citation/,36neu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p8ea3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/relationships/node/,p8ea3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bb6862e2721c80017fa13bd/,5bb6862e2721c80017fa13bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36neu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/36neu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/36neu,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.025

Yet this digital tide suggests several concerns regarding its impact and both its established and emergent research topics at the individual, institutional, and country level.  In this paper, an outlook of the field was developed based on a sample of +1,300 documents indexed in Scopus from 1983 to 2018. Public institutions in Brazil and Colombia have been both the most cited and productive in the region. Nevertheless, documents lead by non-LATAM authors showed significant differences in both paper citations and journals’ h-index compared to leading authors from LATAM. Three of the major concerns raised were, first, a growing inter-regional gap among LATAM countries. Second, the intensive use of a journal with predatory features over the last five years, therefore cites/document measure is at the lowest point of the past 17 years. And third, the delay of recently emergent topics in the region that have been in the literature for more than a decade, while frontier topics for BMA innovation such as those of Industry 4.0 remain unnoticed.",TRUE,FALSE,Bibliometrics|Innovation|Latin America,2018-10-10T02:14:41.083071,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-10T02:14:11.693937,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Julián David Cortés-Sánchez,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/citation/,7rqkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ce3rx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/relationships/node/,ce3rx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbcf1e1cbf33d0019b62376/,5bbcf1e1cbf33d0019b62376,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7rqkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7rqkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7rqkt,NA
