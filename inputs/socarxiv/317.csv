To close this gap, I propose a new value-based proposition for Open Science, that is akin to the “four fundamental freedoms” of Richard Stallman that catalysed the Free Software movement.

	The study location is at Gamao Subdivision, Barangay San Francisco, Panabo City. Eighty-three (83) MOBA Games players had been selected to participate the interviews which was being answered by the survey questionnaires.
	The survey questionnaires focused on what was the MOBA Games impact and influences to the members of a family. This has been grouped according to the – age range, gender, socio economic status, number of the siblings and playmate.
	The study shows that family members does not manifest excessive MOBA games usage and does not greatly manifest Family Interaction between members of the family. Also, this shows a significant relationship between the level of MOBA games usage and in the level of family interaction.
	The study recommended that families should learn how to value and manage time in order to be more productive and effective in building interaction between family members and should build strong connection among its family members.

The Philippine Government has presented serious commitment to ICT in academics by announcing a series of inventiveness to apply ICT in teaching and learning. These were associated with the Millennium Development Goals and the Education for All movements. They have provided a global policy and regulatory environment for the directions and nature of interventions towards the achievement of significant improvement access to and quality of primary education. Other considerable policy documents have identified the need for ICT reform within the education sector and these have resulted in more prioritizing from regions, schools and teachers regarding the incorporation of ICT into the education system. This study purpose is to evaluate the Level of ICT competencies towards teaching strategy of SHS teachers in ACES Polytechnic College. A survey questionnaire was distributed to a total of fifteen (15) teachers served as respondents. The instrument consists of three parts; the first part is composed of the demographic profile of the teachers and the second part focused on the ICT Competencies, and the third part is the teaching strategy of the teacher. The research method used in this study was a descriptive correlational method.

Results showed that most of the teachers have basic knowledge of ICT and needs improvement. More training is at this moment required to the teachers for them to integrate ICT in teaching and other related task assigned to them to uplift and enhance the quality of education of the said college. Findings indicate that teachers' well-equipped preparation with ICT tools and facilities is one of the main factors in the success of technology-based teaching and learning.

Explaining tacit coalition behavior among civil war actors,"We provide a bottom-up system approach to explain tacit coalition behavior among civil conflict actors. We introduce the concept of tacit coalitions, which pertains to strategic and informal coalition behavior between civil war actors. Our theoretical model of coalition behavior focuses on the trade-off between reaping benefits from pooling resources, while at the same time worrying about the division of spoils in case the coalition is successful in winning the conflict. It provides novel insights to the way synergies within potential coalitions affect this trade-off.

In general, arguments regarding a given candidate’s electability often claim that they would affect the general election by changing the behavior of a certain subset of eligible voters. For example, is it more important electorally that a candidate drives turnout or swing voting? As lay consumers of political opinion, we were having difficulty weighing these claims from a strategic standpoint.
Although candidate electability is a nebulous term that might be interpreted in various ways, one interpretation of the term is a population-based causal question: what would the effect of the Democratic nominee be on the presidential election result? Population-based causal questions are commonly studied in epidemiology. To aid interpretation of electability arguments, we frame the question through a counterfactual model used in epidemiology.
Specifically, we define the causal effect by characterizing the population of eligible voters into nine counterfactual response types. The definition clarifies our ability to interpret arguments regarding the electability of the candidates. For example, the causal effect can be subdivided into three parts: the effect of the nominee on 1) Democratic turnout, 2) Republican turnout, and 3) swing voting. We show using notation that the third part has twice the weight as the other two.
The definition follows intuition. However, we hope its formalization using counterfactual response types may foster inter-disciplinary communication.",TRUE,FALSE,causality|counterfactual model|epidemiology|political science,2020-03-09T03:12:42.419984,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-09T03:12:21.229989,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/citation/,6qzb3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e62b33da096450238051855/,5e62b33da096450238051855,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qzb3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qzb3,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.05.002

However, there is currently no standardized method for quantifying cumulative vaccination maintenance, and no simple way to explore predictors of adherence to vaccination schedules. We therefore sought to 1) develop a Vaccination Maintenance Score (VMS) and 2) apply this score to determine the predictors of vaccination behavior among infants in western Kenya (n=245).

Methods: Women in western Kenya were enrolled during pregnancy and surveyed repeatedly through one year postpartum. Data were collected on a range of sociodemographic and health indicators and vaccinations. For each infant, we analyzed receipt of 11 vaccines recommended by the Kenyan Ministry of Health. We operationalized VMS as the total number of vaccines received on schedule. Vaccines that were not received or received off-schedule were scored 0. VMS was modeled using multivariable tobit regression models.

Results: We found that 85.7% of infants were fully immunized, but only 42.4% had optimal VMS, i.e. scored 11. The median(IQR) VMS was 10(3). In multivariable regression, each one-point increase in maternal quality of life score (range: 0-32) was associated with a 0.22-point increase in VMS; each additional child in the household was associated with a 0.34-point increase in VMS; and initiating breastfeeding at birth was associated a 2.01-point increase in VMS.

Conclusions: Coverage of the recommended vaccinations (85.7%) was nearly twice as high as the cumulative timely receipt (42.4%). The VMS satisfies a need for a location-specific but easily adaptable metric of vaccination adherence behavior. It can be used to complement traditional methods of vaccination coverage and timeliness to better understand underlying behaviors that influence vaccination events, and thereby inform interventions to improve vaccination rates and decrease the burden of vaccine-preventable disease.",TRUE,FALSE,Kenya|sub-Saharan Africa|vaccination adherence|vaccination coverage|vaccination maintenance|vaccination timeliness,2020-03-08T08:24:31.549284,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-08T08:24:06.108529,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/citation/,4s76n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/49jne/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/relationships/node/,49jne,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6282aaa09645020f0519e6/,5e6282aaa09645020f0519e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4s76n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4s76n,NA

We are interested in two different structures in the media coverage of scientific results. Firstly, the structure of sources that journalists use, i.e. scientific journals, and secondly, the congruence of the journalistic selection of single results. Previous research suggests that the selection of sources and results follows a certain heavy-tailed distribution, a power law. Mathematically, this distribution can be described with a function of the form C*x-α. We argue that the exponent of such power law distributions can potentially be an indicator to describe selectivity in journalism on a high aggregation level. In our input-output analysis, we look for such patterns in the coverage of all scientific results published in the database Scopus over four years. To get an estimate of the coverage of these results, we use data from the altmetrics provider Altmetric, more precisely their Mainstream-Media-Score (MSM-Score). Based on exploratory analyses, we define papers with a score of 50 or above as Social Impact Papers (SIPs). Over our study period, we identified 5,833 SIPs published in 1,236 journals. We consider a power law fit with an exponent of about -2 to be plausible for the distribution of the source selection but cannot confirm the power law hypothesis for the distribution of the selection of single results. In this case, an exponentially truncated power law seems to be the better fit.",TRUE,FALSE,automated data retrieval|heavy-tailed distributions|input-output analysis|power laws|science journalism|social dissemination of science|social structures,2020-03-06T11:11:02.229435,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T11:10:36.392775,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/citation/,jszt7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ep4na/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/relationships/node/,ep4na,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e621f440f987d01f74955e0/,5e621f440f987d01f74955e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jszt7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jszt7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jszt7,NA

In this sense, Spain does not escape from these diagnoses. Both international indicators that try to measure the situation and evolution of freedom of expression in different States and academic scholars highlight the excessive criminalization of certain speeches that end up in criminal proceedings that sentence people who make offensive expressions, mainly through social networks. However, in order to reach this diagnosis it is necessary to put together all the symptoms that would lead us to that conclusion. Therefore, in this paper I analyze two main indicators that could shed more light on the state of freedom of expression in Spain and the impact that social networks have had on it. Firstly, I analyze the legislative evolution of expression offences since 1995, to evaluate the limits of certain expressions in order to reach the conclusion that, effectively, over the years the punitive scope of what cannot be expressed has been extended, thus limiting, at least in abstract, freedom of expression. Secondly, I analyze the jurisprudential evolution of all these crimes since 1995 to show that, indeed, the proliferation of sentences from 2015 to the present shows the increase in the criminalization of expressions that are made eminently through social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. To conclude, I reflect on the possibility that the latest absolutory sentence by the Constitutional Court of the singer of the band Def con Dos César Strawberry will increase the feeling that, from now on, all expression is admissible and, therefore, will increase free expression in general and, in particular, in social networks, since, it does not seem that our legislator is willing to rectify in its steps the excessive criminalization of certain offenses. I also reflect on the need to approach freedom of expression in a more empirical way and the need to evaluate not only the limitations that the law and judicial processes impose on freedom of expression, but also the extent to which citizens in general and, in particular, users of social networks, without the need to have gone through any criminal proceedings, have stopped expressing their opinions because only in this way will it be possible to determine the state of health of our right to freedom of expression.",TRUE,FALSE,criminal law|freedom of expression|self-censorship|social networks,2020-03-09T03:14:40.596944,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-09T03:14:23.436144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/citation/,ufxwd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e621dc1a0964501d7051cfd/,5e621dc1a0964501d7051cfd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufxwd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufxwd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufxwd,NA
