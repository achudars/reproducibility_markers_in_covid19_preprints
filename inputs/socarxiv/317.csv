How extent of meat restriction impacts individual dietary experience,"There are a variety of approaches to addressing meat overconsumption including forms of meat restriction that vary by the degree of reductions and the type of meat reduced. This study examines three such diets—a vegetarian diet, a reduced-meat diet, and a chicken-free diet—with a focus on the differences in the lived dietary experiences of their adherents. These lived experiences are operationalized using a variety of measures: satisfaction with food-related life, social ties, convenience, social/personal life, health, cost, motivation, identity, perception of prevalence rates, length of diet adherence, and the theory of planned behavior (intentions, attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms). The data comes from an online survey of a cross-sectional, census-balanced sample of more than 30,0000 U.S. residents aged 18+ years sourced from Nielsen’s Harris Panel. The results showed meat reducers to be a larger group than previously suspected, with a third of American adults self-identifying as reducing their meat consumption, compared to one percent each who identify as a vegetarian or chicken avoider. The findings also demonstrated that a vegetarian diet had the strongest lived dietary experiences among American adults who are currently eating one of the meat-restricted diets. This research speaks to how the degree and type of meat restriction can impact an individual’s lived experience with their diet.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-13T18:49:46.939307,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-13T18:49:20.618767,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/citation/,ycbd2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vhjem/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/relationships/node/,vhjem,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a83ac7483ec0017503c5a/,5d7a83ac7483ec0017503c5a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycbd2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ycbd2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ycbd2,NA

Among the most striking impacts are the demographic contraction of modern humans into southern refugia and the potential formation of a population bottleneck. In Iberia and southern France transformations also included the occurrence of significant technological changes, mostly marked by the emergence of a diverse set of bifacially-shaped stone projectiles. The rapid dissemination of bifacial technologies and the geographical circumscription of specific projectile morphologies within these regions have been regarded as evidence for: (1) the existence of a system of long-distance exchange and social alliance networks; (2) the organization of human groups into cultural facies with well-defined stylistic territorial boundaries. However, the degree and modes in which cultural transmission have occurred within these territories, and how it may have influenced other domains of the adaptive systems, remains largely unknown. Using southern Iberia as a case-study, this paper presents the first quantitative approach to the organization of lithic technology and its relationship to hunter-gatherers' territorial organization during the LGM. Similarities and dissimilarities in the presence of metric and morphological data describing lithic technologies are used as a proxy to explore modes and degrees of cultural transmission. Statistical results show that similarities in technological options are dependent on the chronology and geographical distance between sites and corroborate previous arguments for the organization of LGM settlement in Southern Iberia into discrete eco-cultural facies.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|LGM|Lithic technology|Western Europe,2019-09-13T18:49:02.947477,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-13T18:48:43.728553,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/citation/,fgxtu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yd2ve/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/relationships/node/,yd2ve,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a6ebefcbf44001b4473f6/,5d7a6ebefcbf44001b4473f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fgxtu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fgxtu,NA

Young people in the UK are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), despite STI testing being freely and confidentially available. Given multiple barriers they may face for attending sexual health clinics (SHCs), young people should be consulted regarding changes to care. Studies have shown that point-of-care tests (POCTs) for STIs, which can accurately diagnose and treat patients in one clinical visit, have potential for individual and public health benefits, yet patient opinions of changes to clinical practice associated with POCT implementation are less understood.
Methods
The Precise study explored patient experiences of UK SHC services and their opinions of POCT implementation plans; here we focus on young participants within the Precise study. Male and female attendees of three SHCs in England were purposively sampled and then invited to participate in a qualitative in-depth interview. Interviews were conducted one-on-one, in person or via telephone, were audio-recorded and transcribed. NVivo (V10) was used to organise data for our content-based analysis.
Results
Ten young people aged 17-22 years, including: three women-who-have-sex-with-men, four men-who-have-sex-with-women and three men-who-have-sex-with-men were interviewed between June 2015 and February 2016. Participants reported SHCs as the best place to receive results because treatment could be stared immediately, with advice and information available. Participants discussed the potential for POCTs to reduce anxiety currently felt waiting for laboratory results. POCTs were found broadly acceptable, and were generally regarded as an innovation to improve SHC experiences. Participants with less previous SHC experience raised concerns that implementation of POCTs could negatively affect the amount and quality of time patients spend in consultations with clinicians and that changes to pathways may cause confusion in clinic.
Conclusions
We advise POCT implementation be accompanied by SHC staff communicating changes in clinical pathways to patients, including method and timeline for receiving results. Our participants valued face-to-face counselling and advice currently experienced in SHCs; these findings emphasise that POCT implementation plans safe-guard these aspects of care. Our findings suggest that POCT implementation in SHCs has potential to improve young people’s clinical experiences, which may facilitate attendance.",TRUE,FALSE,antibiotic resistance|antimicrobial resistance|point of care|point-of-care tests|sexual health|sexually transmitted infections|young people,2019-09-12T14:41:24.534492,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12T14:40:50.589752,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/citation/,25y36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tvn8z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/relationships/node/,tvn8z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a4d857483ec00194fa920/,5d7a4d857483ec00194fa920,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/25y36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/25y36,NA

New plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) provide a means to enhance PMF systems more quickly and with greater precision than ever before, and have the potential to produce health and health-related products that are superior to current mammalian systems. However, the feasibility, regulatory standing and social acceptability of both PMF and NPBTs are in question. This paper qualitatively explores the perceptions of key stakeholders on two European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 programmes – Pharma-Factory and Newcotiana – towards the barriers and facilitators of PMF and NPBTs in Europe. One-on-one qualitative interviews were undertaken with N=20 individuals involved in one or both of the two projects at 16 institutions in seven countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain and the UK). The findings indicate that the current EU regulatory environment and the perception of the public towards biotechnology are seen as the main barriers to scaling-up PMF and NPBTs. Competition from existing systems and the lack of plant-specific regulations likewise present challenges for PMF developing beyond its current niche. However, respondents felt that the communication of the benefits and purpose of NPBT PMF could provide a platform for improving the social acceptance of genetic modification. The importance of the media in this process was highlighted. This article explores the justifications used by scientists for the use of NPBTs for crop improvement and suggests that the multi-level perspective framework is a useful tool for understanding the systemic factors that have shaped the development of PMF up until today.",TRUE,FALSE,Barriers and Facilitators|New Plant Breeding Techniques|Plant Molecular Farming|Qualitative Research|Responsible Research and Innovation,2019-09-12T14:40:22.443175,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12T14:40:01.632803,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/citation/,gwve2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a3ac79defac0017165714/,5d7a3ac79defac0017165714,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gwve2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gwve2,NA

One of the most recent strategies that exploit social
contacts for the purpose of marketing, is referral marketing, where a person shares information related to a particular product
among his/her social contacts. When this spreading of marketing information goes viral, the diffusion process looks like an
epidemic spread. In this work, we perform a systematic study with a goal to device a methodology for using the huge amount of
survey data available to understand customer behaviour from a more mathematical and quantitative perspective. We perform
an unsupervised natural language processing based analysis of the responses of a recent survey focusing on referral marketing
to correlate the customers’ psychology with transitional dynamics, and investigate some major determinants that regulate the
diffusion of a campaign. In addition to natural language processing for topic modeling, detailed differential equation based
analysis and graph theoretical treatment, experiments have been performed for generation of a recommendation network to
understand the diffusion dynamics in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous population. A complete mathematical treatment
with analysis over real social networks can help us to determine key customer motivations and their impacts on a marketing
strategy, which are important to ensure an effective spread of a designed marketing campaign. Pointing out possibilities of

The failure to accurately predict Brexit or Donald Trump’s success in the US presidential election left everybody perplexed as neither, especially the latter, was ever predicted to occur. This research investigates the failures of the media to predict Trump’s election and investigates whether Twitter can be used in the place of existing procedures to correctly predict elections. Data obtained through this research shows that online discussion of Trump by Twitter users was higher than discussion of Hillary Clinton during four critical events leading up to election day. This paper argues that this data can be used to make successful predictions for election outcomes. The findings and conclusion help underscore the importance of this type of research, not only in terms of predicting elections via Twitter, but also in terms of how such insights might benefit the media and its audiences.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-12T14:35:06.102792,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12T14:34:43.402542,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/citation/,uexsc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eu5jm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/relationships/node/,eu5jm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d79f81afcbf44001a444c46/,5d79f81afcbf44001a444c46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uexsc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uexsc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uexsc,NA

Leveraging advantages of digital publishing, megajournals are characterized by large publication volume, broad interdisciplinary scope, and peer review filters that select primarily on scientific soundness as opposed to novelty or originality. These publishing innovations are complementary and/or competitive vis-à-vis traditional journals. We analyze how megajournals (PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports) are represented in different fields relative to prominent generalist journals (Nature, PNAS, Science) and ‘quasi-megajournals’ (Nature Communications, PeerJ). Our results show that both megajournals and prominent traditional journals have distinctive niches, despite the similar interdisciplinary scopes of such journals. These niches – defined by publishing volume and disciplinary diversity – are dynamic and varied over the relatively brief histories of the analyzed megajournals. Although the life sciences are the predominant contributor to megajournals, there is variation in the disciplinary composition of different megajournals. The growth trajectories and disciplinary composition of generalist journals – including megajournals – reflect changing knowledge dissemination and reward structures in science.",TRUE,FALSE,information science|journals|megajournals|publishing,2019-09-12T14:32:23.961268,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12T14:32:10.795081,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/citation/,px8kt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d78f404f3535b001ae39485/,5d78f404f3535b001ae39485,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px8kt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/px8kt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/px8kt,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24299
