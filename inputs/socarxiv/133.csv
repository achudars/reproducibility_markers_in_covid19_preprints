Much less research has analyzed how climatic variability influences the size of human populations, despite reasonable expectations of such effects. Evidence of climate-fertility linkages, or lack thereof, is needed to refine understandings of adaptive behaviors. It is also needed to refine models of the demographic drivers of greenhouse gas emissions, which tend to assume climatic changes will not feedback to impact population dynamics. We test this relationship using birth histories from 23 sub-Saharan African countries and high-resolution climate data. Our analyses show that exposure to climatic variability is associated with fertility in sub-Saharan Africa, albeit in complex ways. Women exposed to hot-and-dry spells experience significant reductions in the annual probability of fertility, while exposure to above-average temperatures and precipitation is associated with increased fertility over baseline. These associations vary between demographic and geographic groups, revealing important differences in vulnerability and adaptive behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|Africa|birth rates|climate change|fertility|population|precipitation|temperature,2020-08-18T07:32:01.063293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18T07:31:27.216887,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Brian Thiede|Sara Ronnkvist|Anna Armao|Demi Amideneau|Katrina Burka,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/citation/,x3jwr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3b2d223bf2520167a1f0cd/,5f3b2d223bf2520167a1f0cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3jwr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x3jwr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x3jwr

Insights from research assessment,"The use of indicators is generally associated with a reduction of perspectival diversity in evaluation that often facilitates making decisions along dominant framings – effectively closing down debate. In this chapter we will argue that while this is indeed often the case, indicators can also be used to help support more plural evaluation and foster more productively critical debate. In order to achieve this shift, it is necessary equally to change understandings, forms and uses of indicators in decision making. These shifts involve, first, broadening out the range of ‘inputs’ taken into account; and second, opening up the ‘outputs', in the sense of developing methodologies for indicator-based analyses to help in considering plural perspectives. In practice, this means a move towards more situated and participatory use of quantitative evidence in evaluation, a shift from universal indicators to contextualised indicating.",TRUE,FALSE,Indicators|Research Evaluation|Scientometrics,2020-08-18T07:31:01.725139,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18T07:30:52.611256,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",Ismael Rafols and Andy Stirling,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/citation/,h2fxp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3b01dad42ad40150ce06af/,5f3b01dad42ad40150ce06af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2fxp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h2fxp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h2fxp

In spite of algorithmic pervasiveness in many areas and wide diffusion in digital life, algorithmic opacity is still poorly understood compared to other ethical issues (e.g., fairness, accountability, and transparency). In this essay, we try to elucidate the relation between algorithmic opacity and moral certainty from the individualistic standpoint and through the virtue ethic perspective. For doing so, we follow hermeneutic tradition and rely on interpretation of recent authors and impactful papers. We summarize our argument as follows: if the algorithm is understood as the combination of rules and numbers we create for simplifying our lives and sharing with others, then our present activities and future actions as imagined, realized or missed, ascertain if algorithmic opacity become a moral issue or problem for us and others. Among the implications, we emphasize that sometime dormant and hard to anticipate, algorithmic opacity becomes an apparent during executions, deployments and prolonged uses of algorithmic systems. Moreover, our lived experience and disharmony between our unrealized expectations and unanticipated algorithmic behavior may lead to moral issues and problems for us and others. Overall, algorithmic opacity may constantly evade the formalization efforts (e.g., outlining as guidelines, principles) or quantification exercises (e.g., assigning numerical values to symbols or signs), both of which are essentially social practices.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithm|algorithmic opacity|hermeneutics|moral certainty|qualitative interpretative research|virtue ethics,2020-08-19T10:26:24.420228,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-19T10:26:07.258034,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/citation/,rjsvk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3adff63bf2520155a1dd15/,5f3adff63bf2520155a1dd15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rjsvk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rjsvk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rjsvk

We aim to develop a conceptual framework in support of intervention designs for preventive health behavior improvement programs and outcomes. The proposed approach is based on a narrative review of empirical literature assessing the limitations of less effective or ineffective field experiments regarding preventive health education and promotion interventions. We found three major limitations regarding the mental model’s balance of treatment and comparison groups, treatment groups’ willingness to adopt suggested behaviors, and the type, length, frequency, intensity, and sequence of treatments.

In the Northeastern United States, fishers grappled with low prices and disruptions to export and domestic markets, leaving many tied to the dock, while others found ways to adapt to the changing circumstances brought about by the pandemic. This paper investigates the short-term impacts of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) on commercial fishers in the Northeast U.S. to understand the effects of the pandemic on participation in the fishery and fishers’ economic outcomes, using data collected from an online survey of 258 Northeast U.S. commercial fishers. This research also assesses characteristics of those fishers who continued fishing and their adaptive strategies to the changing circumstances. Analysis of survey responses found the majority of fishers continued fishing during the early months of the pandemic, while a significant number had stopped fishing. Nearly all reported a loss of income, largely driven by disruptions of export markets, the loss of restaurant sales, and a resulting decline in seafood prices. Landings data demonstrate that while fishing pressure in 2020 was reduced for some species, it remained on track with previous years for others. Fishers reported engaging in a number of adaptation strategies, including direct sales of seafood, switching species, and supplementing their income with government payments or other sources of income. Many fishers who had stopped fishing indicated plans to return, suggesting refraining from fishing as a short-term adaptation strategy, rather than a plan to permanently stop fishing. Despite economic losses, fishers in the Northeastern U.S. demonstrated resilience in the face of the pandemic by continuing to fish and implementing other adaptation strategies rather than switching to other livelihoods.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|COVID-19|fisheries|livelihoods|resilience,2020-08-18T07:29:41.662176,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18T07:29:21.709147,FALSE,NA,no,"Survey data contain sensitive and confidential data on human subjects.

But why should successive shocks be additive? Can the first shock dampen the second? By empirically investigating the professional mobility of judges and prosecutors in Romania over two consecutive crises – the 2017-2019 judicial reforms, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic – this article shows that a first shock can make a social structure more structurally robust to subsequent blows, while contextually amplifying the effects of secondary shocks. Methodologically, this article introduces the open-source Romanian Judicial Professions (1978-2020) database. Theoretically, it contributes to the study of consecutive crises by proposing a new concept, “structural shockwaves,” and uncovering two emergent phenomena associated with sequential structural shockwaves – undertow and rip-currents.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|judicial independence|mobility|professions|Romania|social theory,2020-08-18T07:28:00.995668,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18T07:27:39.311643,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/gfjke/,no,"Exploratory, rapid-response research, preregistration not applicable.",,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/citation/,hg9tq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gfjke/,gfjke,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3aa858d42ad40143cda3f5/,5f3aa858d42ad40143cda3f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hg9tq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hg9tq

Inequality in Digital Preparedness of Students and Schools before the Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disordered the educational process across the globe, as schools suddenly had to provide their teaching in an online environment. One question that raised immediate concern is the potential effects of this forced and rapid digitalization on inequalities in the learning process by social class, migration background and sex. Elaborating on the literature on the digital divide, we study inequalities in digital preparedness of students and schools, before the pandemic took place. Using data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) on seven countries, and the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) on 45 countries, both from 2018, we demonstrate that schools and students vary in their preparedness for digital education, but that school variation is not systematically related to the student composition by socioeconomic and migration background. More important drivers for a digital divide in corona-times are the ICT skills students have, which are strongly related to socioeconomic background (known as the second level of the digital divide). We found little evidence for a hypothesized ‘fourth level’ of the digital divide, which would result from social gradients in the preparedness of school environments for digital education.",TRUE,FALSE,country comparisons|COVID-19|Education|inequality|teachers,2020-08-18T07:27:10.069681,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18T07:26:44.134264,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.iea.nl/studies/iea/icils/2018|http://www.oecd.org/education/talis/,available,NA,https://osf.io/ajfxk/,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/citation/,58d6p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3a9a2825e5dc0152c9311d/,5f3a9a2825e5dc0152c9311d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58d6p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58d6p

This essay explores the mutual shaping that has occurred between technological solutions and public health policy in the Global North, where governments have allowed capacity to drive policy rather than vice versa. This has led to a situation where contact-tracing and other surveillance technology has become centered in policy, at the expense of the human capacity and material resources that were, and are, necessary to combat the pandemic effectively.

To limit its dissemination, it is essential to know what determines the ability to distinguish between true and false news stories. In our experimental study, we present the subjects corona-related stories taken from the media from various categories (e.g. social isolation, economic consequences, direct health consequences, and “bullshit”). The task is to evaluate the stories as true or false. Besides students with and without healthcare background, we recruit healthcare professionals to increase the external validity of our study. Our main findings are: (i) Healthcare professionals perform similar to students in correctly distinguishing between true and false news stories. (ii) The propensity to engage in analytical thinking and actively open-minded thinking is positively associated with the ability to distinguish between true and false. (iii) We find that the residence of the subjects (East- or West-Germany) plays only a minor role.

The problem about “hidden variables”, or the “conservation of energy conservation” in quantum mechanics: A historical lesson for future discoveries","The explicit history of the “hidden variables” problem is well-known and established. The main events of its chronology are traced. An implicit context of that history is suggested. It links the problem with the “conservation of energy conservation” in quantum mechanics. Bohr, Kramers, and Slaters (1924) admitted its violation being due to the “fourth Heisenberg uncertainty”, that of energy in relation to time. Wolfgang Pauli rejected the conjecture and even forecast the existence of a new and unknown then elementary particle, neutrino, on the ground of energy conservation in quantum mechanics, afterwards confirmed experimentally. Bohr recognized his defeat and Pauli’s truth: the paradigm of elementary particles (furthermore underlying the Standard model) dominates nowadays. However, the reason of energy conservation in quantum mechanics is quite different from that in classical mechanics (the Lie group of all translations in time). Even more, if the reason was the latter, Bohr, Cramers, and Slatters’s argument would be valid. The link between the “conservation of energy conservation” and the problem of hidden variables is the following: the former is equivalent to their absence. The same can be verified historically by the unification of Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave mechanics in the contemporary quantum mechanics by means of the separable complex Hilbert space. The Heisenberg version relies on the vector interpretation of Hilbert space, and the Schrödinger one, on the wave-function interpretation. However the both are equivalent to each other only under the additional condition that a certain well-ordering is equivalent to the corresponding ordinal number (as in Neumann’s definition of “ordinal number”). The same condition interpreted in the proper terms of quantum mechanics means its “unitarity”, therefore the “conservation of energy conservation”. In other words, the “conservation of energy conservation” is postulated in the foundations of quantum mechanics by means of the concept of the separable complex Hilbert space, which furthermore is equivalent to postulating the absence of hidden variables in quantum mechanics (directly deducible from the properties of that Hilbert space). Further, the lesson of that unification (of Heisenberg’s approach and Schrödinger’s version) can be directly interpreted in terms of the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics in the cherished “quantum gravity” as well as a “manual” of how one can do this considering them as isomorphic to each other in a new mathematical structure corresponding to quantum information. Even more, the condition of the unification is analogical to that in the historical precedent of the unifying mathematical structure (namely the separable complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics) and consists in the class of equivalence of any smooth deformations of the pseudo-Riemannian space of general relativity: each element of that class is a wave function and vice versa as well. Thus, quantum mechanics can be considered as a “thermodynamic version” of general relativity, after which the universe is observed as if “outside” (similarly to a phenomenological thermodynamic system observable only “outside” as a whole). The statistical approach to that “phenomenological thermodynamics” of quantum mechanics implies Gibbs classes of equivalence of all states of the universe, furthermore representable in Boltzmann’s manner implying general relativity properly … The meta-lesson is that the historical lesson can serve for future discoveries.",TRUE,FALSE,|BKS theory|class of equivalence|energy conservation in quantum mechanics|fourth uncertainty relation|general relativity and quantum gravity|Gibbs and Boltzmann thermodynamics|Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics|pseudo-Riemannian space|Schrödinger’s wave mechanics|separable complex Hilbert space|unitarity,2020-08-20T05:58:20.889007,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T05:58:07.043219,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/citation/,3uaym,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3a328c3bf25200f1a25d21/,5f3a328c3bf25200f1a25d21,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uaym/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3uaym/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3uaym
