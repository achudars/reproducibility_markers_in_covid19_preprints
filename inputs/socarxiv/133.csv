The sorting of students into schools is not random, and a large immigrant peer effect literature uses school fixed effects to eliminate selection bias. However, keeping schools fixed also eliminates the effect of the school context and is accordingly unsuited to estimate the total effect of attending immigrant-dense schools. By using both a value-added approach and by drawing on application data to manage selection bias, I demonstrate that attending immigrant-dense upper secondary schools in Norway negatively affect students’ completion of academic tracks, even though a school fixed effects model indicates no immigrant peer effects. These findings suggest that immigrant-dense schools affect students in other ways than through mere peer exposure, and that research on the consequences of school segregation should take into account the effect of both school context and peers.",TRUE,FALSE,application fixed effects|immigrant|peer effects|school context|school effects|school fixed effects|school segregation,2020-12-10T03:40:43.175403,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-10T01:38:30.338023,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/citation/,yc37h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sqkbh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/relationships/node/,sqkbh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd090d208ec9e0045b8b97d/,5fd090d208ec9e0045b8b97d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yc37h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yc37h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yc37h,NA

This field has mostly taken a descriptive approach where features are analyzed, compared in detail to glean information about the epoch and culture. In this interdisciplinary study, we propose a novel numerical encoding of costumes based on the interaction of costumes with human anatomy. Using methods from machine classification on a set of costumes from ancient to contemporary periods, we show that costumes of different epochs and cultures are separable in the two dimensional principal component space. We use the Eigen costumes to analyze the immutable similarity in Indic costumes through the ages and the contrasting features between Indic and non-Indic. We further dwell into primary sources to demonstrate that these characteristic features of Indic costumes were very likely considered and deliberate choices in order to induce beneficial effects on prāṇa in specific, and achieve harmony in Yoga in general. We hope that this work will be a small first step for an alternate way of deriving insights into personal choices, societal trends and cultures using methods from life sciences and computation.",TRUE,FALSE,Anatomy|Indian Costumes|Machine Classification|Prāṇa|Principal Component Analysis (PCA)|Yoga,2020-12-09T19:40:42.073274,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-09T13:28:24.953787,FALSE,NA,no,Supplementary data is provided.,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cbe|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Hindu Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/citation/,3h9xy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vpgsz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/relationships/node/,vpgsz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fcf32c76ebcc603ba4749d1/,5fcf32c76ebcc603ba4749d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3h9xy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3h9xy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3h9xy,NA

It focuses on empirical approaches used by ethnographers and sociologists studying digital culture. In the context of digital social research, this may involve observing or collecting actual behaviors and actions in social networking platforms or studying use and interactions with and around digital devices, technologies, and media in naturalistic environments. It might also involve recording and observing in contrived settings, like workshops, focus groups, experiments, or interviews. The target of one’s study could include people in their physical forms or just data produced through human behaviors, movements, or flows of information. The study might seem small scale, whereby one is looking at a single case, instance, individual or small group, or largescale, when exploring patterns in aggregated datasets, analyzing upswells or shifts of interest in events or crisis, examining how ideas flow or emerge through various groups, platforms, or networks. With such a broad range of topics, approaches, choices, there will obviously be different theories, concepts, methods, ethics, and best practices. This paper provides a good starting point.

In existing studies on how information and communication technologies influence work, researchers investigate work-life boundaries and how workers use digital media to obtain more control. This article focuses on how digital media influences daily interpersonal interactions in the workplace: how does social media use influence workplace hierarchies and power dynamics? Based on 56 in-depth interviews with WeChat users in Chinese workplaces, I find that lower-ranked individuals were compelled to constantly express loyalty and appreciation, and publicly submit to their superordinates by clicking “like” or commenting on their WeChat posts. They also had to provide immediate and polite responses to their superordinates in WeChat group chats after work hours or to non-work-related issues. The distinctive features of online interaction—lack of physical interaction spaces, recordability of past conversations, and n-adic nature of online disclosures—created an environment where past encounters were omnipresent and accessible, and placed workers under permanent observability. This social interaction environment leaves little room for forms of resistance and, in response, employees retreat into cynical performances of submission. This study finds that, under certain circumstances, WeChat use actually intensifies workplace hierarchies and power dynamics, thereby sharpening social inequality, rather than eliminating it.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-08T05:53:02.129973,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-08T05:49:23.271663,FALSE,NA,no,"Because of ethical reasons, data collected for this research are not open to public use.",,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,Xiaoli Tian,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/citation/,8r7q3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fcea607aa60b803998962fa/,5fcea607aa60b803998962fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r7q3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8r7q3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8r7q3,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12662
