Past work has been divided on this question. Some scholars point to competition between attitudes toward these entities, suggesting substitution, whereas others highlight positive correlations, suggesting complementarity. Addressing this question, however, is difficult, as it requires assessing the effects of exogenous changes in the latent valuation of one authority on an individual’s support for another. We show that this quantity—a type of elasticity—cannot be inferred from correlations between support for the two forms of authority. We employ a structural model to estimate this elasticity of substitution using data from 816 villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo and plausibly exogenous rainfall and conflict shocks. Despite prima facie evidence for substitution logics, our model’s outcomes are consistent with complementarity; positive changes in citizen valuation of the chief appear to translate into positive changes in support for the government.",TRUE,FALSE,Central authority|Congo|Social contract|Traditional authority,2020-01-14T16:23:02.121125,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:14:35.509473,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/citation/,j9e57,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d7fc76822bd0110ff0b0f/,5e1d7fc76822bd0110ff0b0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9e57/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9e57/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414018806529,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9e57

Evidence from Eastern Congo,"Existing research suggests a strong link between mining and local conflict but makes no distinction between artisanal and industrial mining. We exploit variation in mineral prices and the granting of industrial mining concessions to investigate how the mode of extraction affects conflict in Eastern Congo. Rising mineral prices increase battles over artisanal mines, indicating competition between armed groups. This effect is much less pronounced for industrial mining. Moreover, the expansion of industrial mining decreases battles, suggesting that companies can secure their concessions. Such expansion does, however, trigger riots, and, when it crowds out artisanal mining, also increases violence against civilians and looting. In line with case-study evidence, these negative effects only materialize when industrial mining companies expand their activities from the research to the production phase.",TRUE,FALSE,Africa|Artisanal mining|Conflict|Congo|Industrial mining|Natural resources,2020-01-14T16:24:41.915030,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:16:38.307414,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/citation/,xt9gj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d7d64855d4c012cb71f4b/,5e1d7d64855d4c012cb71f4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xt9gj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xt9gj/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.06.025,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xt9gj

The Impact of Dodd-Frank in the DRC","The Dodd Frank Act was passed by the US Congress in July 2010 and included a provision—Section 1502—that aimed to break the link between conflict and minerals in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. To date there is only one rigorous quantitative analysis that investigates the impact of Dodd-Frank on local conflict events. Looking at the short-term impact (2011–2012), it finds that the policy backfired. This study builds on a larger, more representative, dataset of mining sites and extends the time horizon by three years (2013–2015). The results indicate that the policy also backfired in the longer run, especially in areas home to gold mines. For territories with the average number of gold mines, the introduction of Dodd-Frank increased the incidence of battles with 44%; looting with 51% and violence against civilians with 28%, compared to pre-Dodd Frank averages. Delving deeper into the impact of the conflict minerals legislation is important, as President Trump suspended the legislation in February 2017 for a two-year period, ordering his administration to replace it with another policy.",TRUE,FALSE,Dodd-Frank Act|Legislation|Minerals|Mining|Violence,2020-01-14T16:25:02.521011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:17:10.589200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/citation/,svwnb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d7c5f855d4c0126b72967/,5e1d7c5f855d4c0126b72967,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/svwnb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/svwnb/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201783,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/svwnb

Yet, experimental tasks are often stripped of any social context, implying that inferences may not directly map to real world contexts. We randomly allocate 632 individuals (grouped randomly into 316 dyads) from small villages in Sierra Leone to four versions of the ultimatum game. In addition to the classic ultimatum game, where both the sender and receiver are anonymous, we reveal the identity of the sender, the receiver or both. This design allows us to explore how fairness behavior is affected by social context in a natural setting where players are drawn from populations that are well-acquainted. We find that average offers increase when the receiver's identity is revealed, suggesting that anonymous ultimatum games underestimate expected fair offers. This study suggest that researchers wishing to relate laboratory behavior to contexts in which the participants are well-acquainted should consider revealing the identities of the players during game play.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-14T16:25:41.863861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-14T16:17:42.476804,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/citation/,j54ar,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1d7a2a855d4c012cb7194b/,5e1d7a2a855d4c012cb7194b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j54ar/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j54ar/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194037,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j54ar
