Moreover, recent literature finds that exposure to one event tends to increase risk of the other. However, next to nothing is known about the size or composition – or changes therein – of the divorced/separated and unemployed (DSU) subpopulation. Using large, nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional datasets extending back to 1984, we aim to fill this gap for the UK. We give a descriptive account of the prevalence and social distribution of DSU, and of the cross-sectional association between its two component states: among which groups, by education and gender, does being either divorced/separated or unemployed most strongly imply a heightened risk of also being the other, and how has this changed over time? We find stable and strong educational inequality in DSU, while the gender gap has narrowed and recently closed. The association between the two states is stronger among men; has weakened strikingly over the time period we consider, for both men and, especially, women; and is educationally stratified among men but not women. Contrary to expectations, higher-educated men in one of the two states are most likely to also be in the other. Possible explanations and further questions are discussed. In particular, we highlight the possibility that over this time period the divorced/separated have become more like the general population, rather than a negatively selected subgroup among whom unemployment is a particular risk.",TRUE,FALSE,cumulative disadvantage|divorced|job loss|marital dissolution|repartnering|unemployed,2019-07-29T12:35:25.905922,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-29T12:35:02.600588,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/citation/,yj6t4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pyc76/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/relationships/node/,pyc76,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3ece4a596eee001d64998a/,5d3ece4a596eee001d64998a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yj6t4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yj6t4,NA

On the one hand, biocitizenship entails the positive, active efforts of human beings demanding their rights to health and well-being. On the other hand, biocitizenship is also understood as an extension of ‘biopolitics’ in the Foucauldian sense, so that biocitizenship disciplines and controls subjects even as it affords them certain rights. While this duality and its various complexities have generated a sizeable body of literature, there has to date been no edited volume on the subject of biocitizenship.

Why should I care about care?” This question, raised by one of María Puig de la Bellacasa’s colleagues, is one that could be reasonably posed by any critical scholar. Care is, after all, a deeply fraught concept. Historically, the ideal of caretaking has been used to justify women’s domestic confinement and their lack of remuneration. More recently, it’s been coopted by corporations in their altruistic marketing strategies (think “CBS Cares” or “Chase Cares” or “Nordstrom Cares”).

In “The Elementary Forms of Religious Life,” Durkheim studied Aboriginal Australian religion in an effort to better understand humanity as a whole. In doing so, he introduced a variety of concepts and terms that to many of today’s readers could be considered rather confusing. This project works to make tangible and relatable the implications behind the esoteric Aboriginal Australian terminology used by Durkheim. It does so by relating vocabulary and themes contained within the text to the galaxy far, far away of Star Wars. Several key examples of this application and relation to Star Wars include relating Durkheim’s totemic force to The Force in Star Wars, connecting the concept of a churinga to the lightsaber, and examining Durkheim’s division between religion and magic by looking at the Jedi and Sith. This project then, utilizes fandom to bridge the gap between a classic sociological text and the pop culture phenomenon of Star Wars.",TRUE,FALSE,Durkheim|Religion|Star Wars,2019-07-27T23:29:45.815512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-27T23:29:21.268866,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/citation/,a48ev,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3prgz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/relationships/node/,3prgz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3ccbc8596eee002062ba0a/,5d3ccbc8596eee002062ba0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a48ev/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a48ev/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a48ev,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NJQHS

The mass pilgrimage movement transformed the place into an open air museum, a space that preserves the remnants of Soviet culture, revealing human tragedies of displacement and deaths, and the nature of state nuclear power. This study examines the impact of the site on its visitors and the motivations for their persistence and activities in the Zone, and argues that through photography, cartography, exploration, and discovery, the pilgrims attempt to decode the historical and ideological meaning of Chornobyl and its significance for future generations. Ultimately, the aesthetic and political space of the Zone helps them establish a conceptual and mnemonic connection between the Soviet past and Ukraine’s present and future. Their practices, in turn, help maintain the Zone’s spatial and epistemological continuity.

Assuming a simple model of tag assignment, we estimate the locations of parties and ideologies in a common space. We find that the recovered scale can be interpreted in familiar terms of 'left vs. right'. Estimated party positions correlate well with ratings of parties' positions from extant large-scale expert surveys, most strongly with ratings of general left-right ideology. Party position estimates also show high stability in a test-retest scenario. Our results demonstrate that a Wikipedia-based approach yields valid and reliable left-right scores comparable to scores obtained via conventional expert coding methods. It thus provides a measure with potentially unlimited party coverage. Our measurement strategy is also applicable beyond Wikipedia.",TRUE,FALSE,ideal point estimation|ideology|keywords|latent variable|left-right|measurement|party position|political position|Wikipedia|word scaling,2019-07-26T22:33:46.441352,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-26T22:33:29.008527,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/citation/,5fg8n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/evxn6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/relationships/node/,evxn6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3b3601a3c0020018860c2f/,5d3b3601a3c0020018860c2f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fg8n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5fg8n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5fg8n,NA

Some scholars have argued that the modern day prison industrial complex is a transparent extension of chattel slavery, while others have asserted that a ubiquity of carceral ideologies has contributed to a broader social inequality—one so affecting as to prevent people from oppressed and marginalized communities from full participation in American life. This scholarship unambiguously attests to ongoing disparities in rates of incarceration calculated along the indices of race and ethnicity; with data cultures expanding—evidenced by growth in sectors such as big data, data science, and data analytics—in the sociocultural landscapes and sociotechnical environments of the United States, more recent scholarship has focused on the ways that technology also contributes to—and often exacerbates—these disparities.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-26T17:11:45.172729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-26T17:11:14.262228,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/citation/,pr87b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3b2849847d2f0018efb6c5/,5d3b2849847d2f0018efb6c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr87b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pr87b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pr87b,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.039
