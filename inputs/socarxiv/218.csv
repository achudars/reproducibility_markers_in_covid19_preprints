As a gauge of the seriousness of these concerns some have suggested that current levels of some of these indicators have not been seen in the US since the time of the great depression. This paper explores how General Collective Intelligence, a recent innovation in group decision-making systems, might reliably generate the economic growth needed to avert such a crisis where not reliably achievable otherwise. Current group decision-making systems, whether choosing a human decision-maker, consensus voting on decisions, or automated decision-systems such as conventional collective intelligence, have been suggested to lack the capacity to maximize more than a very few group outcomes simultaneously due to specific limitations. Since impact on collective well-being is determined by impact on an open (unbounded) set of outcomes, this implies lack of the capacity to maximize the necessary range of impacts on well-being for groups if that range is too broad. If so, the breadth of impact required to achieve sustainable “green” economic development while simultaneously solving hunger, solving the environmental degradation that consensus has linked to climate change, as well as providing maximal access to healthcare, education, and other resources, may not be reliably possible with current decision systems. General Collective Intelligence or GCI replicates the adaptive problem solving mechanisms by which nature has demonstrated the ability to optimally respond to an unlimited set of problems, and by which nature has demonstrated the ability to potentially increase sustainability per unit of resources by orders of magnitude so that life is reliably self-sustaining. This paper explores why GCI can potentially be used to reliably drive self-sustaining economic growth to revive economies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and why GCI has the potential to reliably drive a transformation to sustainable green economies while doing so.",TRUE,FALSE,economic development|GCI|General Collective Intelligence|green growth|sustainable development,2020-04-21T05:03:24.280023,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-20T16:01:14.820651,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/citation/,arw7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9d50a8f1353506b3d599c3/,5e9d50a8f1353506b3d599c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/arw7c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/arw7c,NA

A recently developed model of general collective intelligence predicts the properties of group decision-making systems that are required to optimize collective outcomes, along with predicting that authoritarian systems of decision-making might tend to be restricted to non-optimal group outcomes in ways that are somewhat hidden in that they require an understanding of this new and relatively unknown model of general collective intelligence. In light of this model of general collective intelligence, the economic restrictions imposed to combat the pandemic take on a new light, since these restrictions have not only resulted in economic lockdowns for some countries, but in some cases have also effectively imposed martial law. The hidden cost of this reduction in civil liberties is explored from the perspective of the cost of an authoritarian decision-making system resulting in non-optimal group outcomes as theorized by this model of general collective intelligence, using models of government inefficiency to assess the cost of those non-optimal group outcomes, and therefore the hidden cost of reduced civil liberties.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil Liberties|coronavirus|COVID-19|GCI|General Collective Intelligence,2020-04-21T05:03:22.518737,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-20T16:01:39.105079,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dee|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Emergency and Disaster Management",Andy E.

As such, many practitioners include multiple factual or informational closed-ended manipulation checks to identify low-attention respondents. However, closed-ended manipulation checks are either correct or incorrect, which allows participants to more easily guess and it reduces the potential variation in attention between respondents. In response to these shortcomings, I develop an automatic and standardized methodology to measure attention that relies on the text that respondents provide in an open-ended manipulation check. There are multiple benefits to this approach. First, it provides a continuous measure of attention, which allows for greater variation between respondents. Second, it reduces the reliance on subjective, paid humans to analyze open-ended responses. Last, I outline how to diagnose the impact of inattentive workers on the overall results, including how to assess the average treatment effect of those respondents that likely received the treatment.

Despite this, defectors often go unpunished and groups with social structures that are a priori favorable often fail. A critical distinction is required between the structural effect on ability versus willingness to punish. We develop a theoretical framework in which variation in a group’s social structure generates a tension between ability and willingness to enforce cooperation. Structures that promote ability to punish also often reduce interest in carrying out sanctions, thus changing collective outcomes. Our empirical analysis involves a well-defined cooperative dilemma: group lending in Sierra Leone. We complement statistical modelling, based on a dataset containing 5,487 group repayments, with ethnographic analysis. We find: (1) Structural cohesion only increases economic cooperation between borrowers to a point, beyond which unwillingness outweighs increased ability to punish, reducing group repayments. (2) Groups with disconnected subgroups perform worse on average.

Grounded in a careful reading of the theoretical literature, this paper argues that the everyday data-related practices of contemporary education can be approached as functional forms of data literacy education: deeds with unintentional educational consequences for students’ relationships with data and datafication. More precisely, this paper suggests that everyday data-related practices represent data as cognitive authority and naturalize the routines of all-pervading data collection. These routines lead to what is here referred to as “data (il)literacy”—an uncritical, one-dimensional understanding of data and datafication. Since functional data (il)literacy education takes place subconsciously, it can be conceptualized as a form of hidden curriculum, an idea that refers to lessons taught and learned but not consciously intended to be so.",TRUE,FALSE,Critical literacy|Datafication|Data literacy|Hidden curriculum,2020-04-19T05:04:47.001994,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T08:12:04.797590,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d52|Education|Language and Literacy Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d64|Education|Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6d|Education|Curriculum and Social Inquiry,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/citation/,sdr79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9aa5b8f1353505f2d599e6/,5e9aa5b8f1353505f2d599e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdr79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sdr79/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sdr79,NA

This misinformation could have important public health consequences if misinformed people are less likely to heed the advice of public health experts. While some have anecdotally tied the prevalence of misinformation to misleading or inaccurate media coverage of the pandemic in its early stages, few have rigorously tested this claim empirically. In this paper, we report the results of an automated content analysis showing that right-leaning news outlets (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart) were more than 2.5 times more likely than mainstream outlets to discuss COVID-19 misinformation during the early stages of the U.S. pandemic response. In a nationally representative survey (N = 8,914) conducted from 3/10-3/16, we then show that people who consumed more right-leaning news during this timeframe were more than twice as likely to endorse COVID-related misinformation. Alarmingly, survey data further suggest that misinformation endorsement has negative public health consequences, as misinformed people are more likely to believe that the CDC is exaggerating COVID-related health risks.",TRUE,FALSE,conspiracy theories|content analysis|coronavirus|COVID|COVID-19|media effects|misinformation|partisan media|political communication|political science|science communication|survey research,2020-04-19T05:03:21.485641,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T08:18:30.625215,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/citation/,a8r3p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4hdgw/,4hdgw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9a1183f1353505c2d54f85/,5e9a1183f1353505c2d54f85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a8r3p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a8r3p,NA

Using four available rounds of India's Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), this paper examines seasonality in infant mortality in India. I use information on the birth month-year, survival status within the first year of life, and age (in months) at death (if the infant died) of more than 330,000 children born between 1989 and 2014 to estimate period mortality rates between ages 0 and 1 for each calendar month. Relative to the spring months, infant mortality is higher in the summer, monsoon, and winter months. If the mortality conditions in the spring months were prevalent throughout the year,  would have been less by 10.8 deaths per 1,000 infant alive per year in early 1990s and 4.1 deaths per 1,000 per year in the mid-2010s.  Seasonal variation in infant mortality is higher among children born in less wealthy households, among children of less educated mothers, in rural areas, and in poorer regions. Although seasonality in infant mortality has attenuated over-time, seasonal variation in the early-childhood disease environment remains a concern, particularly in rural areas. These results highlight the multiple environmental health threats that infants in India face, and the limited period within a year when these threats are less salient.",TRUE,FALSE,child health|child mortality|environment|India|infant mortality|seasonality,2020-04-19T05:04:43.883395,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T08:17:32.062701,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",Aashish Gupta,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/citation/,x4rv7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e99fdf2f1353505b0d55238/,5e99fdf2f1353505b0d55238,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4rv7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4rv7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4rv7,NA
