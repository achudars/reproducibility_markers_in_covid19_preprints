It can be challenging for teacher educators to support teacher candidates in learning through these experiences when the records of practice are stored in audio or video files. This article discusses a portal being developed through design-based research to allow teacher educators to access and efficiently process records of teacher candidates’ performance from a digital simulation. A pilot study was conducted to see how two teacher educators used a prototyped portal to plan and facilitate a post-simulation debriefing with five teacher candidates, and to identify additional opportunities to foster teacher candidate learning. Findings suggest that accessing short transcripts of teacher candidate performance supported teacher educators in planning a debriefing that was grounded in clear learning objectives and responsive to teacher candidates’ needs, while using the data from the portal to make practice public during the debriefing created opportunities for targeted feedback and supported meaning-making.",TRUE,FALSE,debriefing|digital simulation|practice based teacher education|Simulation|teacher education,2019-02-12T15:40:07.537814,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12T15:38:16.072281,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7f|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Higher Education and Teaching,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/citation/,pwqb8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c619e11832ca60017b252a7/,5c619e11832ca60017b252a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pwqb8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pwqb8

This study proposes a new framework, called the Inclusion-Immediacy Criterion (IIC), that better assesses the inclusion and immediacy of research to determine whether the research helps marginalized communities, reduces inequality, and encourages inclusive innovation. To test the framework, the study analyzes NSF sponsored nanotechnology grant abstracts from 2013 to 2017. We find that 109 out of the 300 grants feature research that is inclusive, while 235 out of the 300 grants have broader impacts that either maintain the status quo or predominately help advantage groups.

The ability to be flexible is affected by a wide variety of sociotechnical factors and determines what we term ‘flexibility capital’. Levels of flexibility capital vary in populations, both absolutely and in the extent to which they are primarily derived from technological or social means, which has implications for the (dis)comfort and (in)convenience involved in economising flexibility capital. Furthermore, we argue that freedom of choice over whether and how to economise flexibility capital can be limited by factors such as financial resources, among others. In constrained systems (such as energy networks), the level of service enjoyed by the more affluent may not simply be higher than those who are less affluent, but may be directly enabled by reductions in the latter’s comfort and/or convenience which may not feel fully voluntary. There is a real risk that such injustices could be locked into energy infrastructure and market design and governance for the long term as has already happened in labour markets. We introduce the concept of ‘flexibility justice’ as a frame for these issues of fairness. While the concepts we offer in the paper emerge from longstanding engagements with energy research contexts and they relate directly to the issues currently being debated in the energy research and policy communities, we contend that they can be related to a much broader range of issues in 21st century economies.",TRUE,FALSE,capital|energy|flexibility|justice,2019-02-12T15:42:50.261261,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12T15:40:09.268024,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/citation/,3nja6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gv2ex/,gv2ex,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c618e9be16f55001792dc13/,5c618e9be16f55001792dc13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3nja6/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.03.015,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3nja6

Only about 70% of articles and reviews from WOS and Scopus could be matched via a DOI to Unpaywall. Matching with Crossref brought 53 distinct licences, which define in many cases the legally binding access status of publications. But only 53% of publications hold only a single licence on Crossref, while more than 42% have no licence information submitted to Crossref. Contrasting OA information from Crossref licences with Unpaywall we found contradictory cases overall amounting to more than 13%, which might be partially explained by (ex-)including green OA.

Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists.

The Protest Behaviour of the 1989 Generation in Europe,"Many studies suggest that citizens of Central and Eastern Europe are less politically active than their peers in Western Europe. Yet, it is unclear whether previous experiences of mobilization moderate these differences. This article focuses on the protest behaviour of the 1989 generation, which is composed of citizens who reached political maturity during the collapse of communism. Building on political socialization theory, the article proposes that citizens exposed to high levels of protest during their formative years might be more inclined to protest later. This implies that mobilization during the transitions from communism might moderate the current East-West gap in participation. The article combines data from 25 new and old democracies to assess how early exposure to protest has affected the participation of the 1989 generation. The results of multilevel models indicate that participation in demonstrations is not significantly lower in Central and Eastern Europe once we account for the level of protest at the turn of the nineties. Furthermore, the Eastern deficit in participation in petitions and boycotts is lower in societies that experienced higher levels of protest during the collapse of communism.

This study incorporates the newest education polygenic score (Lee et al. 2018) into sociological research, and tests three gene-environment interaction hypotheses on status attainment. Using the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,625), I report three findings. First, a standard deviation increase in the education polygenic score is associated with a 60% increase in the likelihood of advancing to the next level of education, while a standard deviation increase in parental education results in a 68% increase. Second, supporting the Saunders hypothesis, the genetic effect becomes 11% smaller when parental education is one standard deviation higher, indicating that highly educated parents are more able to preserve their family’s elite status in the next generation. Finally, the genetic effect is slightly greater for the younger cohort (1942~59) than the older cohort (1920~41).

One dimension of precarious work of growing interest to scholars and policymakers is instability faced by workers in the amount and regularity of their work hours. However, we know little about the magnitude of month-to-month or week-to-week (intra-year) volatility in hours worked, the extent of class-based polarization in this measure of job quality, and whether worker power moderates this polarization. In this paper, we make novel use of the panel nature of the nationally-representative Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate intra-year volatility in the actual hours respondents report working in the previous week across four consecutive survey months. Using this new measure, we then show that, net of demographic characteristics and controls for occupation and industry, low-wage workers experience disproportionately greater work hour volatility. Finally, we find evidence that reductions in marketplace bargaining power--as measured by higher state-level unemployment rates--increase wage- and education-based polarization in work hour volatility, while increases in associational power--as measured by union coverage--reduce wage-based polarization in work hour volatility.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-11T04:41:27.729159,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-11T04:41:13.039536,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/citation/,rzfg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c60f11476653c0019271c60/,5c60f11476653c0019271c60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rzfg2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rzfg2

Most of these studies, though, do not follow former prisoners over extended periods of time and into older adult ages when it is more likely that cumulative consequences of incarceration will be felt. This paper contributes to this literature by employing for the first time the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the long-run association between individual incarceration and mortality over nearly 40 years, and supplementing those analyses with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). We then use these estimates to investigate the implications of the US incarceration regime and the post-1980 incarceration boom for the US health and mortality disadvantage relative to industrialized peer countries (the United Kingdom).",TRUE,FALSE,Decomposition|Health Inequality|Incarceration|Mortality|PSID|United Kingdom|United States,2019-02-11T04:39:27.588038,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-11T04:39:04.858358,NA,NA,no,Data are restricted.,,no,Secondary data.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/citation/,b8xe6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c604a20832ca60018ad8ccb/,5c604a20832ca60018ad8ccb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8xe6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8xe6
