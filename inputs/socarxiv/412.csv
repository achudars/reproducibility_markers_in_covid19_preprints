The mass pilgrimage movement transformed the place into an open air museum, a space that preserves the remnants of Soviet culture, revealing human tragedies of displacement and deaths, and the nature of state nuclear power. This study examines the impact of the site on its visitors and the motivations for their persistence and activities in the Zone, and argues that through photography, cartography, exploration, and discovery, the pilgrims attempt to decode the historical and ideological meaning of Chornobyl and its significance for future generations. Ultimately, the aesthetic and political space of the Zone helps them establish a conceptual and mnemonic connection between the Soviet past and Ukraine’s present and future. Their practices, in turn, help maintain the Zone’s spatial and epistemological continuity. Importantly, Chornobyl seems to be polysemic in nature, inviting interpretations and shaping people’s national and intellectual identities. http://kmhj.ukma.edu.ua/article/view/150381",TRUE,FALSE,Chornobyl|identity|pilgrimage|polysemy,2019-07-27T14:01:42.113133,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-27T14:01:20.741737,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/citation/,w26h3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3c1932f644df001c61d22e/,5d3c1932f644df001c61d22e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w26h3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w26h3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w26h3,https://doi.org/10.18523/kmhj150381.2018-5.1-36

It makes responses challenging to compare intertemporally or interpersonally. This paper develops a formal model of the cognitive process that could give rise to scale norming in year on year responses to life satisfaction scale questions. It then uses this model to conceptually differentiate scale norming from adaptation and changes in reference points. Scale norming could make life satisfaction responses misleading with regards to the changing welfare of individuals. In particular, individuals who would say that their life is ""improving"" or ""going well"" might nonetheless give the same scale response year after year. This has major implications for the use of scales in cost-benefit analysis and other welfarist applications. While there is already substantial empirical evidence for the existence of scale norming, its implications for welfare analysis are sometimes understated on the grounds that this evidence might simply be the product of errors of memory. The paper presents new empirical evidence for scale norming from two surveys (N1 = 278; N2 = 1050) designed such that errors of memory are an unconvincing explanation for the results.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|Life Satisfaction|Measurement|Scale-Norming|Subjective Well-Being,2019-07-26T17:11:05.707372,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-26T17:10:33.974052,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Mark Otto Fabian,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/citation/,cg8n9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3b0292eb4caa001a9a792e/,5d3b0292eb4caa001a9a792e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cg8n9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cg8n9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cg8n9,NA

This study identifies near repeat crime patterns in Dallas, Texas and examines the effects of an arrest on reducing the probability of future crime. 

Method: Using open source crime data from the Dallas Police Department from July 2014 through June 2018, we identified near repeat patterns for shootings, interpersonal robberies, residential burglaries, and thefts from motor vehicles. Logistic regression models were used to test the effect of an arrest on reducing near repeat crimes; controls for geographic, demographic, and temporal factors were included in each model. 

Results: Near repeat calculations suggest violent crime clustered closely in time and space, with property crime dispersed over larger spatial and temporal dimensions. Across all four crime types, findings suggest arrests resulted in 20% to 40% reductions in a near repeat follow up crime.

Conclusions: In line with past research on shootings, arrests reduced the likelihood of subsequent crimes. This suggests policing strategies to increase arrests may be a fruitful way to reduce near repeat crime patterns.

Paid parental benefits policies are explicitly aimed to encourage return-to-work and enhance infant health. However, some recent policies also aim to equalize housework and paid work within families by earmarking weeks of parental benefits for fathers that cannot be transferred to mothers. We examine two theoretical frameworks from sociology and economics to highlight potential mechanisms through which such policies may increase or decrease union dissolution, and why the direction and magnitude of the effects might differ across subpopulations. Then, using population-level administrative data, we examine how the Quebec Parental Insurance Program affected union dissolution. We find that overall, the policy decreased the divorce/separation rate by 0.6% points, a 7% reduction in the rate overall (intent-to-treat). Further, we find that the effect of fathers using parental benefits on the risk of divorce (treatment-on-treated) is more than double the intent-to-treat estimate. The policy had the greatest effects in reducing union dissolution among couples likely to be more egalitarian in orientation, and led to no increase in divorce, even in the most traditional couples.",TRUE,FALSE,divorce|family|gender equality|parental leave|policy,2019-07-25T18:59:22.210738,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:59:04.997400,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Rachel Margolis|Youjin Choi|Anders Holm|Nirav Mehta,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/citation/,kqfd7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d39d366eb4caa0018999437/,5d39d366eb4caa0018999437,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kqfd7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kqfd7,NA

However, this literature remains somewhat nascent, and has yet to fully tap into the potential methodological insights of political science. In this paper, we seek to systematically review all cyber conflict articles published in a top-100 political science journal between 1990-2018. We perform a bibliometric analysis, identifying key articles and thematic topics. We also perform a methodological review in an effort to understand the most widely used methods, approaches, and case studies deployed in the literature. The findings suggest that the field has perhaps focused on theoretical work at the expense of empirical work, and that cyber conflict scholarship has yet to fully draw upon the broader debates on case selection, case study research, and quantitative/qualitative work that have taken place in political methodology in the last two decades. We briefly conclude with potential future avenues of research that could help amend these challenges.",TRUE,FALSE,case studies|cyber conflict|cybersecurity|ISA|methods|political science,2019-07-25T19:41:01.717757,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:40:44.894367,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,Max Smeets|Robert Gorwa,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/citation/,fc6sg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d39b706eb4caa001799f44b/,5d39b706eb4caa001799f44b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fc6sg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fc6sg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fc6sg,NA
