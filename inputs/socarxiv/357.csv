This chapter argues that similar to other financial market actors, securities exchanges have themselves undergone a significant transformation. In the last 25 years, marketization, internationalization, and digitization have fundamentally changed the way exchanges function, turning them from national marketplaces into markets actors. As a result of this transformation, exchanges have become crucial agents in processes of financialization. First, by organizing capital markets they influence market dynamics, facilitating volatility and market stability. Second, exchanges have turned into agents of disintermediation, selling and exporting financial technologies and expertise, facilitating the development of capital markets globally. Third, exchanges have emerged as politically and economically powerful players, both vis-à-vis other market actors but also towards regulators and states. Overall, through their transformation exchanges have become crucial actors in the spreading of capital markets, the transformations of contemporary finance and the politics of financialization.",TRUE,FALSE,capital markets|derivatives exchange|digitization|disintermediation|financialization|internationalization|marketization|stock exchange,2019-12-02T11:36:24.465639,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-30T02:49:39.206878,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/citation/,5emgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de1251ae1e62f000b2e5d2d/,5de1251ae1e62f000b2e5d2d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5emgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5emgs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5emgs,NA

Such situation occurs commonly in a variety of settings, for example in the social and biomedical sciences. Model based approaches, such as multi-state models or hidden Markov models, designed to study the transitions across states, are being used increasingly to analyze trajectories and to study their relationships with a set of explanatory variables. Comparing the performance of competing models, typically based upon different assumptions, is an open problem. To accomplish this task, we introduce a novel approach based on microsimulation, i.e. the model-based generation of trajectories, and on dissimilarities. In particular, we discuss some criteria to compare competing models with respect to their ability to generate trajectories similar to the ones in the data.

Members of European environmental grassroots initiatives reconcile lower carbon footprints with higher life satisfaction and income increases,"Scientists and policymakers recognize the need to address consumption and lifestyles in order to reconcile environmental and development agendas. Sustainability-oriented grassroots initiatives emerge bottom-up to create
opportunities for sustainable lifestyles; yet no prior assessment has ascertained the efficacy of their members to reduce carbon footprints (CF) and enhance well-being. We compare the CF of non-members and members of
grassroots initiatives in the domains of food, clothing, housing and transport. We further compare the groups by
testing the influence of socio-economic variables that are typically associated with both footprint and well-being.
Here we show that grassroots initiative members have 16% lower total carbon footprint, and 43% and 86%
lower carbon footprints for food and clothing respectively, compared to their “non-member” regional sociodemographic counterparts. We find a higher adoption of some energy-saving behaviors for initiative members
such as greater active travel distance and lower indoor temperatures in the winter, yet no significant differences
in the CF of housing and transport. Interestingly, increases in income are not associated with increases in the
total CF of members, while the influence of income is confirmed for the CF of the total sample. Instead, factors
such as age, household size, and gender better explain the variation in the domain-specific CFs of initiative
members. Finally, members show higher life satisfaction compared to non-members and are 11–13% more likely
to evaluate their life positively. Our results suggest that initiative members uncover lifestyle features that not
only enable lower emissions, but also reconcile emissions with income and well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,carbon footprint|double dividend|grassroots initiatives|life satisfaction|sustainable consumption|volunteers,2019-11-27T16:26:01.598998,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-27T16:25:40.168800,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Experimental Analysis of Behavior|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/citation/,3at5z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dde84a1fbde36000a943d88/,5dde84a1fbde36000a943d88,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3at5z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3at5z,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.101329

Western Zhou introduced philosophical ideas, cultural motifs, governing practices, and social institutions that have had a profound and lasting impact on Chinese and East Asian societies.  Unfortunately, only a partial chronology of this time period survives.  Recovering the absolute dates of Western Zhou has since become a classical question that remained unresolved for over two millennia.  Here I report a successful reconstruction of this long-sought chronology using archaeoastronomical methods.  Systematic analysis of the relative compatibility of all 81 known fully-dated bronze inscriptions revealed the definitions of the lunar phase terms, which enabled computation of absolute dates.  These calculations, combined with available archaeological and textual evidence, produced a complete chronology starting in the year King Wen received the Mandate of Heaven and ending in the year of King Ping's death.  The results also reveal a previously unknown seven-year gap in the regnal years of Zhou, which explains the inconsistencies between excavated material and the annals of Shiji.

However, social scientific interest in alienation had become parochial and balkanized by the 1970s. To reconstruct a unifying theory of alienation that addresses general features of capitalism, such as compulsory growth and commodification, and particular phases like financialized capitalism, we begin with the notion of futurelessness. Futurelessness refers to a deficient relationship to the future in which people’s senses of possibility ossify or dissipate.

It uses the same methodological procedures and applies them to a for-profit, general interest firearm magazine that has been continuously published for 65 years: Guns magazine. Like the earlier study, we hypothesize that the center of gravity in US gun culture has evolved over time from “Gun Culture 1.0,” the historic gun culture of hunting and recreational shooting, to “Gun Culture 2.0,” America’s contemporary defensive gun culture, an evolution reflected in the content of gun advertisements. The data show that the predominance of Gun Culture 1.0 themes in advertising persists through the 1980s and into the 1990s, when the center of gravity of gun culture begins to shift decisively toward the Gun Culture 2.0 themes of personal protection/self-defense and concealed carry. This trend continues through the 1990s and 2000s, with the two emphases crossing-over in the 2010s. As reflected in advertising, in addition to other indicators such as self-reported reasons for gun ownership, Gun Culture 2.0 is now America’s dominant and still expanding core gun culture today.",TRUE,FALSE,advertising|culture|firearms|gun culture|guns|sociology,2019-11-28T20:26:22.360344,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-28T20:26:10.992798,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,David Yamane,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/citation/,urwkd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dddaf28fbde36000a938340/,5dddaf28fbde36000a938340,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urwkd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/urwkd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/urwkd,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-0437-0

As such, it resembles a sexual activity. OM is taught as a practice that is distinct from sex, and we wondered whether people who engage in OM actually maintain that distinction themselves. We conducted an online convenience sample survey including qualitative open-ended text questions and quantitative Likert-style questions that was distributed to email listservs for practitioners of OM. The 30-item questionnaire included questions designed to differentiate the potentially related concepts of OM, seated meditation, fondling, and sex, as bases for comparison. The quantitative results of this mixed method study show that OM practitioners view the practice as significantly more similar to meditation than to sex or fondling. These results were consistent, regardless of whether the question was asked in the positive or negative and whether OM was being compared to one behavior individually or to multiple behaviors at the same time. The distinction between OM and sex/fondling rapidly becomes more pronounced as practitioners complete more OMs. This suggests that the novelty of genital touching in meditation may diminish over time, as practitioners get used to the more alternative point of focus. The results of this study have implications for the practice and how it is approached and regulated.",TRUE,FALSE,mindfulness|orgasmic meditation|sex|sexuality,2019-11-27T11:14:22.506298,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-27T11:14:06.746760,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/citation/,89fvt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dddad82ab905e000ae80b13/,5dddad82ab905e000ae80b13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/89fvt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/89fvt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/89fvt,NA
