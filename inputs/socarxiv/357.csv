Management commitment is a critical issue as lack of it could lead to failures in governance, fraud, inefficacy, corruption as well as weak financial management, particularly in the public sector. This study evaluated the state of present practices of management commitment among public sector employees from various Malaysian service schemes. Primary data were collected using a questionnaire survey approach with 194 heads of departments in the Malaysian federal ministries. The collection of data was in accordance with the perspective of 10 factors in management commitment practices, using a five-point Likert scale. Factor analysis and descriptive statistics were utilized for data analysis. In addition, data reliability was checked by Cronbach’s alpha test, data normality was examined by Skewness and Kurtosis tests, and data validity was tested by using Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test and Barlett’s test. The findings show that 97% of the participants reported that they practised management commitment within their departments. Nevertheless, the priority for these management commitment factors varied according to the service schemes. In general, management commitment practice was the highest within the groups that used the finance scheme and the lowest among the employees who were under the accounting and audit schemes.

United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI) invites investors to consider ESG issues when evaluating the performance of any company. Moreover, nowadays the contribution of corporations towards sustainable development is a major concern of investors, creditors, government, and other environmental agencies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of ESG factors on the performance of Malaysian public limited companies in terms of profitability, firm value, and cost of capital.
Design/methodology/approach – A total of 54 companies are selected from Bloomberg’s ESG database that has complete ESG and financial data from 2010 to 2013. This study conducted panel data regressions such as the pooled OLS, fixed effect, and random effect.
Findings - Based on the regression results, there is no significant relationship between individual and combined factors of ESG and firm profitability (i.e., ROE) as well as firm value (i.e., Tobin’s Q). Moreover, individually, none of the factors of ESG is significant with the cost of capital (WACC), but the combined score of ESG positively and significantly influences the cost of capital (WACC) of a company.
Practical implications - As this is a new study on Malaysia, the findings of this study will be useful to investors, SRI analysts, policy makers, and other related agencies.

This study developed a new model of fraud risk by integrating new elements into a fraud triangle theory. This study simultaneously analyzed religiosity and the three elements of fraud risk factors of employee fraud committed by low and mid-level public officials. The data collected from 120 enforcement officers indicated that religiosity is negatively related to employee fraud. By contrast, all the three elements of fraud triangle theory, namely, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization, are positively related to employee fraud. These results imply that strong religiosity is crucial to mitigate employee fraud. To minimize employee fraud, the opportunity to commit such fraud should be reduced through strong internal control, reduction of negative rationalization, and employee financial pressure.

In addition, we interviewed renowned scholars in the fields of Islamic accounting and Shariah law. Consequently, this study proposes an extended model of human capital that is applicable to Islamic organizations. Apart from knowledge and competency, this study includes spiritual value as another construct of human capital in Islamic organizations. Knowledge includes ideas that are relevant to the accounting and auditing spectra, as well as Shariah principles and jurisprudence. By contrast, competency refers to the ability to innovate unique Shariah-compliant products that are rare and difficult to imitate. Meanwhile, spiritual values embrace the elements of “Siddiq,” “Amanah,” “Fathonah,” and “Tabligh.” This study affirms that knowledge, competency, and satisfaction are the most significant constructs of human capital that explain performance.

There is a law to promote whistleblowing practices, but the negative subsequent effect of whistleblowing demotivates the reporting of unethical behaviours. Thus, it is important to identify the factors that motivate an employee to exercise whistleblowing in an organization. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether the personal factor of job satisfaction and organizational factors such as fair treatment as well as cooperativeness contribute to the whistleblowing practice in an organization.
Design/methodology/approach: This study collected primary data based on a questionnaire survey from 73 respondents of the seven top most GLCs in Malaysia. The data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.
Findings: The findings of the study reveal that only fair treatment is statistically significant and positively related to the whistleblowing practice. The findings imply that if employees perceive that the organization provides fair treatment in terms of career advancement, awards, training, performance appraisal, job assignment, and pay increases, they would tend to report wrongdoing activities to protect the image of the organization.
Practical implications: The findings of the study will help the policy makers to ensure better working environment and accountability in the public sector of Malaysia and other similar countries.

The findings revealed that ethical values were negatively related to employee fraud, and two elements of fraud triangle theory, namely, opportunity and rationalization, were positively related to employee fraud. This implies that high ethical value is crucial to mitigate employee fraud. To minimize employee fraud, the banking industry should reduce opportunities and employee negative rationalization through strong internal control.

The government obligations in PPP projects are often limited to feasibility study, transaction support and implementing linked government or public sector projects which subsequently raise the question regarding how the required funds should be mobilized by the government for these services as upfront development cost. Generally, any government agency driving a PPP project has to secure budgetary allocation from the central authority for performing the government-side obligations, which is often a complicated and time consuming process due to other priorities of the central treasury. To overcome this challenge, establishment of a central PPP development facility by the government is required. The ability to create and manage such a facility within the government mechanism will ensure seamless development and implementation of PPP projects by different government agencies and will contribute to foster a good relationship between the government and the private sector investors.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-29T07:15:46.316071,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-29T07:15:13.642360,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/citation/,qvgp4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ka2rz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/relationships/node/,ka2rz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d021be37b8c4d00189aeffe/,5d021be37b8c4d00189aeffe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qvgp4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qvgp4

Several factors such as social, economic, political, demographic, natural, and livelihood strategies cause vulnerability in the status of household food security. This study is an attempt to examine the vulnerability of the factors of household food accessibility and its linkage with the climatic changes in Malaysia.
Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on primary data collected in the months of July – October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 low-income households from the East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on the cluster random sampling technique. The questionnaire uses a five-point Likert scale, and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ANOVA F statistics for Chi-Square Two Sample Test.
Findings: The study finds that the vulnerability of the factors of household food accessibility has increased statistically and significantly over the last five years in Malaysia, whereas the contributions of climatic factors are low on these changes. This study suggests that the food security programs in Malaysia need to be integrated with the climatic change adaptation programs to ensure more effective and sustainable household food security in the future.
Originality/value: This study is an original work based on primary data that empirically measures the vulnerability of the factors of household food accessibility, one of the important dimensions of household food security, and its linkage with climatic changes.",TRUE,FALSE,Climate Change; Household Food Security; Food Accessibility; Vulnerability; Poverty; Malaysia,2019-06-14T10:28:05.306836,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14T10:27:31.910904,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/citation/,8gq9v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gvh5w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/relationships/node/,gvh5w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d021b29760f11001bfbcb0c/,5d021b29760f11001bfbcb0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gq9v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8gq9v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8gq9v
