This study presents findings from our investigation of the suitability of a simulation called “Teacher Moments” for two parent-teacher conference scenarios. Students in a preservice education class completed two Teacher Moments simulations as assignments during the semester. Using a design-based approach, we document how we learn from multiple implementations and discuss the outcome of the revised design. Our findings suggest that students perceive simulations within Teacher Moments as authentic experiences that provoke cognitive dissonance.

We present a model based on a multi-urn extension of the classic Eggenberger-Polya urn, in which each district is represented by an urn and there is correlation between urns.

Results showed that, although some faculty were novices, most interviewees thought it would be beneficial to teach web accessibility in a variety of LIS courses. However, despite the seeming consensus, discussion of incorporating web accessibility into curricula was rare.

The study approaches these topics from a user-centered perspective, with the idea that blind users themselves can provide particularly reliable insights into the issues and potential solutions that are most critical to them. Most participants used reference librarians’ assistance, and most had positive experiences. High-level screen reader users requested help with specific needs. A larger number of participants reported contacting a librarian because of feeling overwhelmed by the library website. In some cases, blind users and librarians worked verbally without the screen reader. Users were appreciative of librarians’ help but outcomes were not entirely positive. Other times, librarians worked with users to navigate with a screen reader, which sometimes led to greater independence. Some users expressed satisfaction with working with librarians verbally, particularly if websites did not seem screen reader user friendly, but many users preferred independence. Participants agreed it would be helpful if librarians knew how to use screen readers, or at least if librarians were familiar enough with screen readers to provide relevant verbal cues. Many users liked and used chat reference and many preferred Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) to learn citation style, though learning citation style was challenging. Questions such as reference librarians’ role when e-resources are not equally accessible deserve wider discussion in the library literature and in practice. Given the challenges described by the research participants and legal requirements for equally effective electronic and information technologies, libraries and librarians should approach reference services for blind users more proactively. Recommendations are provided.

The study uses the perspective that blind users’ insights are fundamental. A common theme was that navigating a webpage is time consuming on the first visit. Issues identified include the need for “databases” to be defined on the homepage, accessibly coded search boxes, logical heading structure, and several problems to be resolved on result pages. Variations in needs depending on users’ screen reader expertise were also raised. Suggestions for libraries to address these issues are offered.

So how can an outside observer, with no access to such private rules, make sense of their behavior?  One way to understand choices is by assigning different values (or meanings) to the alternatives depending on the context.  The number of additional values can then be viewed as a measure of the background information involved while making the choice. In this paper, we show that two values are sufficient to perceive any choice behavior as consistent. This implies that the information gleaned from a menu is never less than the background information involved in making the choice.",TRUE,FALSE,background information|choice|menu consistency|revealed preference,2018-07-02T11:55:49.572095,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-14T15:49:54.795504,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/citation/,gf6wq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zyw27/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/relationships/node/,zyw27,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b21407544572c000d884e58/,5b21407544572c000d884e58,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf6wq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gf6wq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gf6wq,NA

Since those definitions were established, OA-related terminology has expanded, trying to keep up with all the variants of OA publishing that are out there. However, the inconsistent and arbitrary terminology that is being used to refer to these variants are complicating communication about OA-related issues. This study intends to initiate a discussion on this issue, by proposing a conceptual model of OA. Our model features six different dimensions (prestige, user rights, stability, immediacy, peer-review, and cost). Each dimension allows for a range of different options. We believe that by combining the options in these six dimensions, we can arrive at all the current variants of OA, while avoiding ambiguous and/or arbitrary terminology. This model can be an useful tool for funders and policy makers who need to decide exactly which aspects of OA are necessary for each specific scenario.",TRUE,FALSE,Conceptual models|Creative Commons|Journals|Open Access|Peer-review|User Rights,2018-07-02T11:55:49.398162,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-13T13:30:21.196831,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/citation/,7b4aj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m2nce/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/relationships/node/,m2nce,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b20fc59ba5d13000d0a106d/,5b20fc59ba5d13000d0a106d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7b4aj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7b4aj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7b4aj,https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/7b4aj

Scholars have paid special attention to activities that rationalize and build administrative capacity, known as legibility projects. Alongside these projects, state actors also rule through ambiguous and unclear techniques that have been given less scholarly attention. I introduce the concept of institutionalized ambiguity in legal status to extend the study of state rule. I ask what generates ambiguity, what purposes it serves in law and policy, and what consequences it has for the management of populations. I propose an analytic approach that draws attention to equivocation in law as enabling classificatory debates and discretion in the political realm. To illustrate the purchase of institutionalized ambiguity in legal status, I analyze how, during the years of formal imperial rule (1898-1946), U.S. state actors debated the racial fitness and membership of Filipinos in the imagined U.S. nation. I consider the broader implications of this analysis for scholars of modern state formation and suggest that foundational conflicts over national identity can be institutionalized in law, in turn facilitating a range of contradictory, but co-existing, legally defensible policies.",TRUE,FALSE,ambiguity|citizenship|empire|sovereignty|U.S.–Philippine relations,2018-07-02T11:55:49.196983,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-13T11:06:25.363829,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c9a|Arts and Humanities|American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/citation/,39g6b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3mkga/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/relationships/node/,3mkga,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b203bddba5d13000d0931c0/,5b203bddba5d13000d0931c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39g6b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/39g6b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/39g6b,NA
