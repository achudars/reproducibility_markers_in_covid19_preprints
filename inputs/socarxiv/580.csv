Furthermore, many past studies rely on convenience samples of college students, or samples gathered outside the United States. Multivariate analyses of the 2012 General Social Survey – a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States – reveal that a slim majority of Americans still do not believe same-sex couples can parent as well as male-female couples and the religious beliefs, behaviors, and affiliations of Americans are significantly and at times differentially associated with appraisals of same-sex couples’ parenting abilities.

It will be argued that the behavioral-genetic concept is a generally useless quantity, while the standard biological concept is overly narrow and implies a false picture of the significance of genes in development. By suitably expanding standard heritability into a general causal concept based on its role in evolution, we will arrive at a general view of development that recognizes the causal parity of all determinants of phenotypic traits and shows why the behavioral genetic dichotomy of genes vs environment is fundamentally misguided.

Second, the chapter identifies three ongoing, interrelated changes to the digital civics landscape that are worthy of greater attention moving forward.

Rather than taking these ideas as a given and looking at their political consequences, I will ask what politics enters at their points of construction, where they are understood as being constructed computationally. This allows me to read across from the Anthropocene and resilience to the other forms of computational anticipation that are becoming pervasive at the level of everyday life. As truth claims that depend on algorithms, I will argue that all of these constructions derive their authority from an entanglement of computation and science. Under current conditions, this entanglement brings it's own political tendencies, which can be characterised as colonial. To counter this implicit colonialism I will draw on the feminist and post-colonial approaches of standpoint theory.

Many divide the discipline of philosophy to Western and Eastern, however, it is argued that this division suffers from the logical fallacy of false dichotomy. A widespread belief that spirituality and theology are subtypes of philosophy is indeed a myth; the formal philosophy deals only with the rational persuasion of ideas to find answers to the real world problems.  An understanding of logic and dialectic is needed to formulate persuasive arguments, which in turn is crucial for the future of any learned citizens, for example, while writing an excellent essay or delivering a charismatic public speech. Albeit the high relevance of this discipline, in India, philosophy is not taught as part of the school or university curricula, which I find a significant foible in our education system.

Research on physicians’ decisions about medical knowledge has focused on doctors’ personal capabilities and features of the knowledge corpus, producing divergent findings. This study addresses these findings by asking instead: how is decision-making about the use of knowledge influenced by specific features of work? From observations of one team’s decisions in multiple clinical and administrative contexts involving different tasks, I argue that the pattern for making specific decisions is contingent upon the length of feedback loops that are specified by the temporal features of physicians’ different tasks. Physicians receive feedback at different speeds depending on the temporal features of a task and they must account for these speeds when they judge what they can prioritize. This finding explains doctors’ perceived uncertainty in other studies as a product of the long feedback loop in tasks, and their certainty or pragmatism as a product of shorter feedback loops.

I develop a conceptual framework in which their decisions to use advanced technologies are informed by “interdependent career types,” a concept that incorporates features of the professional social context of physicians’ work and the expertise they use, and reflects how medicine distributes expertise via formal and informal referral structures. I draw on data regarding specialized physicians’ differentiated use of this technology over five years, as well as interviews with those who continue to use the technology and those who have abandoned it. I argue that interdependent career types stratify physicians’ standpoints on multiple dimensions of medical work – including those related to their concerns about reputation, inclinations towards risk, and preferences regarding the use of their bodies.",TRUE,FALSE,careers|medicine|professions|robotics,2018-07-02T11:21:42.859084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-06T23:09:15.965424,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/citation/,95ygk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m4g6j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/relationships/node/,m4g6j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a00eb15594d9002646615df/,5a00eb15594d9002646615df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/95ygk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/95ygk/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146517738088,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/95ygk

This article focuses on how people who share and engage in tasks in recurrently-visited venues define and change their social projects’ problems and solutions. To address the complexities of this “meta-work,” I introduce the concept of “tethers.” Tethers are links across venues that people use to set and shift these problems and solutions that are continuously being contested. Drawing on examples from the author’s fieldwork and other ethnographic accounts of professional work, I examine three types of tethers: focal participants, things, and language. Paying attention to tethers also results in practical implications for taking fieldnotes, timing observations, and choosing fieldsites. I argue that a focus on subjects’ use of tethers across venues helps mitigate the challenges ethnographers face when accounting for the influence of temporally and geographically distant sites of recurrent interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,ethnography|methods|professions,2018-07-02T11:21:42.822835,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-06T23:05:07.073161,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/citation/,sw84r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ywkv9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/relationships/node/,ywkv9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a00e9f96c613b0275b93dca/,5a00e9f96c613b0275b93dca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sw84r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sw84r/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124117729695,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sw84r
