Payment systems that allow people to pay using their mobile phones are 
promised to reduce transaction fees, increase convenience, and enhance 
payment security. New mobile payment systems also are likely to make it 
easier for businesses to identify consumers, to collect more information 
about consumers, and to share more information about consumers’ 
purchases among more businesses. While many studies have reported 
security concerns as a barrier to adoption of mobile payment 
technologies, the privacy implications of these technologies have been 
under examined. To better understand Americans’ attitudes towards 
privacy in new transaction systems, we commissioned a nationwide, 
telephonic (wireline and wireless) survey of 1,200 households, focusing 
upon the ways that mobile payment systems are likely to share 
information about consumers’ purchases.

We found that Americans overwhelmingly oppose the revelation of contact 
information (phone number, email address, and home address) to merchants 
when making purchases with mobile payment systems. Furthermore, an even 
higher level of opposition exists to systems that track consumers’ 
movements through their mobile phones.

We explain some advantages of mobile payment systems, some challenges to 
their adoption in the United States, and then turn to our main finding: 
Americans overwhelming reject mobile payment systems that track their 
movements or share identification information with retailers. We then 
suggest a possible remedy for such information sharing: adapting 
provisions of California’s Song-Beverly Credit Card Act, which prohibits 
merchants from requesting personal information at the register when a 
consumer pays with a credit card, to mobile payments systems. Our survey 
results suggest that consumers would support limitations on information 
collection and transfer. Song-Beverly could be adopted to accommodate 
those who wish to share their transaction data.

Alan Westin’s well-known and often-used privacy segmentation fails to 
describe privacy markets or consumer choices accurately. The 
segmentation divides survey respondents into “privacy fundamentalists,” 
“privacy pragmatists,” and the “privacy unconcerned.” It describes the 
average consumer as a “privacy pragmatist” who influences market 
offerings by weighing the costs and benefits of services and making 
choices consistent with his or her privacy preferences. Yet, Westin’s 
segmentation methods cannot establish that users are pragmatic in theory 
or in practice. Textual analysis reveals that the segmentation fails 
theoretically. Original survey data suggests that, in practice, most 
consumers are not aware of privacy rules and practices, and make 
decisions in the marketplace with a flawed, yet optimistic, perception 
of protections. Instead of acting as “privacy pragmatists,” consumers 
experience a marketplace myopia that causes them to believe that they 
need not engage in privacy analysis of products and services.

Westin’s work has been used to justify a regulatory system where the 
burden of taking action to protect privacy rests on the very individuals 
who think it is already protected strongly by law. Our findings begin to 
suggest reasons behind both the growth of some information-intensive 
marketplace activities and some prominent examples of consumer backlash.

Based on knowledge-testing and attitudinal survey work, we suggest that 
Westin’s approach actually segments two recognizable privacy groups: the 
“privacy resilient” and the “privacy vulnerable.” We then trace the 
contours of a more usable segmentation and consider whether privacy 
segmentations contribute usefully to political discourse on privacy.

This case involved an important issue of contract interpretation majorly 
affecting the market for digital music downloads with serious 
implications for the welfare of many recording artists. At issue was the 
""Masters Licensed"" clause and the usage of standard terms in a deal 
involving the artist Eminem that paralleled the terms in a great many 
recording agreements. And while the recording label Appellees tried 
characterize these contracts as unique to these parties, the 
interpretation of the basic terms at issue — especially ""license"" and 
""sale"" — affected nearly every American recording artist signed to a 
major record label, including many members of amicus Motown Alumni 
Association. For example, one agreement between Motown Records and The 
Temptations drew exactly the same distinction in its royalty structure 
between records sold and recordings that were licensed to third parties.

During the proceedings below, the District Court failed to give adequate 
consideration to the broader context of the contractual terms at issue 
and the role they play in the music industry. In this appeal, amicus 
urged the Court not to make the same mistakes and, in particular, to 
consider three key factual and legal aspects of the music industry that 
are relevant to resolving the dispute: (1) the major labels’ frequent 
and repeated use of strained contractual interpretations, abstruse 
royalty structures, and strategic accounting practices to deny artists 
proper notice and fair compensation, including the historical failure to 
pay out accurate royalties earned under artist contracts; (2) the 
incentives record labels have to contort contractual terms in order to 
avoid paying higher “license” royalties to artists, given their changing 
role in a music market rapidly shifting to digital distribution; and (3) 
the specific context and meaning of common copyright terms such as 
“license” and “sale” in the federal Copyright Act.

In light of these considerations, amicus urged the Court to adopt a 
strong presumption that when music contracts conveying copyright 
interests use terms derived from within the Copyright Act, such as 
""license"" or ""sale,"" the Act's default terminology should apply, and 
only in rare cases where there is substantial evidence that the parties 
unambiguously agreed to deviate from these common statutory meanings 
should these terms be susceptible to different interpretations. This 
practice comports with well-settled principles of contract law, the 
proper allocation of risks in recording contracts, and the reasonable 
expectations of artists, enabling them to rely on common industry 
understandings and the plain meaning of the terms, regardless of changes 
over time in technology, distribution methods, or the labels' business 
models.

Homo economicus reliably makes an appearance in regulatory debates 
concerning information privacy. Under the still-dominant U.S. “notice 
and choice” approach to consumer information privacy, the rational 
consumer is expected to negotiate for privacy protection by reading 
privacy policies and selecting services consistent with her preferences. 
A longstanding model for predicting these preferences is Professor Alan 
Westin's well-known segmentation of consumers into “privacy 
pragmatists,” “privacy fundamentalists,” and “privacy unconcerned.”

To be tenable as a protection for consumer interest, “notice and choice” 
requires homo economicus to be broadly reliable as a model. Consumers 
behaving according to the model will know what they want and how to get 
it in the marketplace, limiting regulatory approaches to information 
privacy. While notice and choice is undergoing strong theoretical, 
empirical, and political critique, U.S. Internet privacy law largely 
reflects these assumptions.

This Article contributes to the ongoing debate about notice and choice 
in two main ways. First, we consider the legacy Westin's privacy 
segmentation model itself, which as greatly influenced the development 
of the notice-and-choice regime. Second, we report on original survey 
research, collected over four years, exploring Americans’ knowledge, 
preferences, and attitudes about a wide variety of data practices in 
online and mobile markets. Using these methods, we engage in considered 
textual analysis, empirical testing, and critique of Westin’s 
segmentation model.

Our work both calls into question longstanding assumptions used by 
Westin and lends new insight into consumers’ privacy knowledge and 
preferences. A close textual look at factual and theoretical assumptions 
embedded in the segmentation model shows foundational flaws. With 
testing, we find that the segmentation model lacks validity in important 
dimensions. In analyzing data from nationwide, telephonic surveys of 
Internet and mobile phone users, we find an apparent knowledge gap among 
consumers concerning business practices and legal protections for 
privacy, calling into question Westin’s conclusion that a majority of 
consumers act pragmatically. We further find that those categorized as 
“privacy pragmatists” act differently from Westin’s model when directly 
presented with the value exchange — and thus the privacy tradeoff — 
offered with these services.

These findings reframe the privacy pragmatist and call her influential 
status in U.S. research, industry practice, and policy into serious 
question. Under the new view, she cannot be seen as “pragmatic” at all, 
but rather as a consumer making choices in the marketplace with 
substantial deficits in her understanding of business practices. This 
likewise calls into question policy decisions based on the segmentation 
model and its assumptions. We conclude that updated research and a 
policy approach that addresses both rationality and knowledge gaps are key.

This paper empirically examines the 17 U.S.C. § 512 notice and takedown 
process as implemented by the Texas online service provider, The Planet. 
We reviewed a random sample of notices from a population of all notices 
processed by The Planet from August 2004 to June 2007. We used a mixed 
methodology, qualitatively assessing the notices, and running 
quantitative checks to ensure that we were not mistakenly over- or 
understating the importance of qualitative findings. Because the notices 
most clearly show sender behavior, we focus on senders’ use of section 
512; we then more generally discuss the possible effects of sender 
behavior on targets and OSPs. We conclude that section 512 continues to 
be useful for copyright holders; in addition, it undoubtedly provides 
important innovation-promoting protection for intermediaries. Yet the 
section 512 regime also shows serious strain in practice, at least 
within our observed set of notices. A considerable group of senders have 
difficulty following section 512’s technical requirements and 
understanding the substantive underlying copyright law. Further, as 
expected, the large copyright industries appear to be challenged by 
peer-to-peer filesharing — a problem for which the notice and takedown 
framework does not provide immediate relief — leading them to make 
broader demands than are supported by section 512. Finally, the emerging 
dominance of third-party rights enforcement organizations (""REOs"") and 
trade associations, which have incentives to generate notices and 
achieve takedowns, add a layer of complexity to the process. Ultimately, 
these strains, and senders’ responses to them, likely affect both OSPs 
and targets. Overall, they prompt concerns about due process for targets 
and potential harms to Internet expression. We reaffirm our previous 
suggestions for reform, and call for greater information sharing and 
transparency to help rebalance and strengthen the section 512 process.

Fueled by recent public and private efforts to improve access to 
scholarly works, academic libraries and archives are increasingly 
digitizing their special collections and creating online repositories 
for scholarly works. This enhanced online presence has increased 
libraries’ exposure to takedown requests from rightsholders and other 
concerned parties. Using survey questions and interviews, we examined 
academic libraries’ interaction with both Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act (“DMCA”) and non-DMCA takedown notices. We found that academic 
libraries most commonly receive non-DMCA takedown requests that are 
based on non-copyright issues (such as privacy) or that target materials 
the library itself has placed online. In general, libraries have 
well-developed norms and practices in place to manage these types of 
requests to remove material. We also found, however, that formal DMCA 
notices directed to libraries have historically been rare, but that this 
may be changing as open access repositories hosted by libraries grow. In 
tracing the recent experience of academic libraries that have received 
DMCA takedown notices targeting material in their open access 
repositories, we found that libraries have not yet developed norms and 
practices for addressing these requests. We discuss why this might be, 
and suggest steps libraries, publishers, and authors can take to best 
manage copyright conflicts while supporting libraries’ missions to 
preserve and provide access to knowledge.

This chapter serves as an introduction to the privacy and security 
issues presented by advanced metering and other ""smart grid"" 
technologies, and to recent policy efforts to address them. The chapter 
introduces the recent political and economic push to move to the ‘smart 
grid’, describes the privacy issues presented by advanced metering 
technologies and the data they gather, and gives an overview of 
regulatory and policy efforts being made to address them as the smart 
grid develops.

Smart electricity meters and other devices that gather or process 
household energy signatures at high temporal resolutions hold a great 
deal of promise. Among other predicted benefits, smart grid technologies 
are expected to better manage energy usage, enable real-time 
demand-response pricing, improve efficient load balancing across the 
grid, and increase the capacity for solar and other edge-based energy 
generation. These predicted benefits depend, in part, on new, richer 
data models of energy flow and usage. The temporally granular data 
collected by advanced metering technologies can reveal detailed 
information about intimate life within the home, raising serious 
questions about how to address privacy interests. Moreover, the present 
vision for the smart grid requires large numbers of new devices and 
gateways to connect from the ‘edge’ of the grid, raising security issues 
that require immediate and sustained attention. Recent and ongoing 
technical and policy efforts in the United States and elsewhere attempt 
to address these issues.

Agents can be empowered voluntarily, with copyright holders opting in to permit licensing of their works, or they can be established or empowered by statute. Collective licensing has been suggested as a possible solution for the obstacle copyright law places in the path of new uses of works enabled by innovative technologies. Collective licensing does have the potential to reduce transaction costs when a large number of works are licensed to a large number of users, thereby benefiting both rightsholders and users. However, the track record of collective organizations (CROs), the entities that manage collective licenses, reveals that they often fail to live up to that potential. Although there are a wide variety of CROs operating under divergent legal frameworks, many unfortunately share the characteristic of serving their own interests at the expense of artists and the public. In discussions of copyright policy, lawmakers generally consider two broad stakeholder groups: authors on the one hand and the general public on the other. This paper will examine how CROs have done significant harm to each of the groups they are supposed to help.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,ASCAP|BMI|CMO|collective management|collective rights organizations|copyright|CRO|GEMA|international copyright|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:13.109077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T16:07:21.878000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/citation/,h5cg6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cr7pb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/relationships/node/,cr7pb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57890a3b6c613b01f3347c19/,57890a3b6c613b01f3347c19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h5cg6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h5cg6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h5cg6
