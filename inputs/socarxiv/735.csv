The first part focuses on some of the early texts of the PRA to understand the approach’s analysis of capitalism and its crises.  This is done through the analysis of the main concepts developed by the contributors to the approach. Regime of accumulation, mode of regulation, and mode of development are three important interrelated concepts that occupy a central place in the conceptual apparatus of the approach. One of the defining properties of the approach is its formulation of accumulation crisis. Particularly, the crisis is not a recurrent manifestation of the same underlying problem in the economy. It is, instead, the overdetermined result of the contained contradictions of the configuration of the social relations in and the processes of the capitalist economy. 
The second part of the work focuses on a notion of a particular tendency (overaccumulation of capital) utilized by Michel Aglietta and modified/formulated later on by Simon Clarke and David Harvey. This part traces the path of the notion among the works of these scholars and compares them.

This article draws on feminist theories of the state to analyze how the routine practices of low-level state bureaucrats impact women's experiences navigating legal institutions in urban Nicaragua. Drawing on ten months of ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, I show how, contrary to theories of representative bureaucracy, the increased presence of women officials within state institutions does not improve most women's treatment by police or prosecutors. Rather, only when women have access to specific forms of social capital are their cases granted legitimacy by state actors. This article illustrates the routine practices by which gendered governance operates, as well as how feminist organizations disrupt patterns of bureaucratic indifference by assuming the banner of legitimacy that is rarely afforded to women victims themselves. These findings raise critical questions about the efficacy of traditional legal and bureaucratic strategies for eliminating violence against women, and suggest that one key alternative is to strengthen the capacities of civil society organizations that provide accompaniment to women victims.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|Latin America|law|Nicaragua|violence against women,2018-07-02T10:46:28.237965,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-27T18:38:51.947000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/citation/,6gw4c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5sjng/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/relationships/node/,5sjng,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b471456c613b01fd7f1348/,58b471456c613b01fd7f1348,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6gw4c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6gw4c,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/sow082

It clarifies how the term Citizen Science is used and identifies different forms of Citizen Science. This is important, since with blurred distinctions there is a risk of both overrating and underestimating the value of Citizen Science and of misinterpreting what makes a significant contribution to scientific endeavour.
The paper identifies three main forms of citizen science 1) Citizen Science as a research method, aiming for scientific output, 2) Citizen Science as public engagement, aiming to establish legitimacy for science and science policy in society, and, 3) Citizen Science as civic mobilization, aiming for legal or political influence in relation to specific issues. In terms of scientific output, the first form of Citizen Science exceeds the others in terms of scientific peer-reviewed articles. These projects build on strict protocols and rules for participation and rely on mass inclusion to secure the quality of contributions. Volunteers are invited to pursue very delimited tasks, defined by the scientists.
The value of the three distinct forms of Citizen Science –for science, for policy and for society, is discussed to situate Citizen Science in relation to current policy initiatives in Europe and in the US. In quantitative terms the US, and particularly the NSF have so far taken a lead in allocating research funding to Citizen Science projects (primarily of the first form), however, the White House has recently issued a memorandum addressing societal and scientific challenges through citizen science covering all three forms discussed in this paper. As Citizen Science is currently being launched as a way to change the very landscape of science, important gaps in research are identified and policy recommendations are provided, in order for policy makers to be able to assess and anticipate the value of different forms of Citizen Science with regard to future research policy.",TRUE,FALSE,citizen science|research funding|science policy|scientific citizenship,2018-07-02T10:52:10.166820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-27T12:44:08.093000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/citation/,tfsgh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e3x4y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/relationships/node/,e3x4y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b41e389ad5a101f912a863/,58b41e389ad5a101f912a863,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfsgh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tfsgh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tfsgh,NA

They left behind a small cemetery consisting of at least six graves. 14C dates made for samples of human bones until 2009 did not coincide with the expected age of the graves. Under a new pilot program in 2010–2013, a series of radiocarbon measurements was made for the human bones and an artefact of red deer antler, along with analyses of the stable isotopes ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in the collagen. The results indicate a significant proportion of freshwater food in the diet, which caused the radiocarbon dates to be too old due to the freshwater reservoir effect (FRE). Based on the dating of the antler, unaffected by FRE, and comparative analysis, the reservoir offset for one of the graves was estimated to 740 radiocarbon years. The results, although limited by a low number of investigated humans and animals, indicate indirectly a specialization in the exploitation of local water resources. Such an economic strategy seems to be characteristic for the societies inhabiting the coasts of the Baltic Sea and littoral zones of large lakes in the Final Neolithic and at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age.",TRUE,FALSE,Burial ritual|Diet reconstruction|Final Neolithic|Freshwater reservoir effect|Isotopes|Radiocarbon dating|Subsistence strategy,2018-07-02T10:51:44.408046,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-27T12:00:53.744000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/citation/,nc8rn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ybm3x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/relationships/node/,ybm3x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b40ed56c613b01f77f124f/,58b40ed56c613b01f77f124f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nc8rn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nc8rn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nc8rn,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.10.012

Whereas, on the one hand, democratic change, constitutional reforms and the recognition of indigenous peoples signal the emergence of a new rights era, on the other hand, deep-running inequalities, persistent poverty and development conflicts reveal structural tensions and the ambiguities of recognition. While such ambiguity is often explained as a consequence of poor implementation and compromised rights standards, this article analyses trends in both orthodox and heterodox polities as well as in the international arena in order to draw further attention to how rights regimes are being renegotiated. Rights under this ‘new jungle law’ are no longer characterised by neglect and poor implementation, but through reappropriation, strategic attention and regulatory negotiations, revealing a sliding scale of potentialities between empowerment and normalisation.",TRUE,FALSE,ILO|indigenous peoples|international human rights|legal anthropology,2018-07-02T10:52:03.412588,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-27T08:51:15.154000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c23|Law|Indian and Aboriginal Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/citation/,qv3t9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v3bb8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/relationships/node/,v3bb8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b3e792b83f6901fdf465e8/,58b3e792b83f6901fdf465e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qv3t9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qv3t9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qv3t9,https://doi.org/10.4000/poldev.2220

Introduction: Soviet Anthropology at the Empire's Edge // Exploring the Edge of Empire. Berlin: LIT Verlag, 2011. P.1-18","In March 2009, the Chicago-based sociologist and fervent advocate of world systems theory Giorgi Derluguian gave a talk at the Georgian State University on 'How not to Stay Provincial'. Although Derluguian referred to the 'state of advanced social science' in general, we consider it no pure coincidence that he chose this title in a place like Tbilisi and in a country like Georgia. It is hard to disagree that, whatever we do as social scientists, we should not be provincial but rather cosmopolitan, addressing the important, timely issues and conversing with dominant theoretical discourses in our works. This seems to be all the more true in the field of regional sciences, which, according to some, are in decline or even in crisis, not least because of their inherent demand for specialization. So here we have the claim that if we want to know something about a region like the Caucasus or Central Asia, we should be guided by the dominant concerns of contemporary social science. This claim is put forward not only by social scientists like Derlugiuan but also by local students. At Tbilisi State University, for example, social anthropology students are eager to become acquainted with the main paradigms of social and cultural anthropology , and many of these students advocate their potential as explanatory tools for their own societies. They are thirsty for theory and hungry for methodology. This appetite for theory and method is often accompanied by a striking disinterest in, and occasionally even distaste for, knowledge generated locally and more than twenty years ago. In the case of Western scholars studying the Caucasus and Central Asia, this disinterest seems to be based on the following assumptions: reading texts by locals is time-consuming, demands a great deal of language proficiency, and the content of these works is oftentimes completely out of fashion. In the case of local students and some younger scholars, Soviet academic traditions are often dismissed in toto. Soviet anthropology in particular is often regarded as being of no value.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:45:09.185400,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-26T17:47:30.214000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/citation/,2saqs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/grmdc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/relationships/node/,grmdc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b313316c613b01f87f11d2/,58b313316c613b01f87f11d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2saqs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2saqs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2saqs,NA
