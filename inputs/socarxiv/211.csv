Background: This study aimed to identify what contributors influenced whether a teacher observed externalizing behaviors among fourth-grade children. 
Methods: Data was obtained from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies (ECLS) Program data set provided by the National Center for Education Statistics. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was conducted to determine the relative importance of the varying factors that were attributed to externalizing behaviors. 
Results: The CART analysis revealed that teacher classification of children as exhibiting externalizing problem behaviors was influenced by internalizing problem behaviors, race, and gender. Exhibiting internalizing behaviors was the most significant contributor. Lower internalizing behaviors were classified as lower externalizing behaviors. Higher internalizing behaviors were further classified by gender, with female students being less likely attributed to high externalizing behaviors. Male students were further classified by race; Caucasian and Hispanic male students were classified with lower externalizing behaviors than African American students. Caucasian and Hispanic students were then classified by internalizing behaviors, with higher internalizing behaviors being classified toward higher externalizing behaviors.  
Conclusion: The findings are supported by the extant literature stating that African American males are more often classified as exhibiting externalizing behaviors.

For twenty years now, it has been a best seller in all the countries of the world where football is culturally important. Its purpose is to simulate a manager’s career with an emphasis on data analysis and number crunching, especially the football match scenario and the football players’ quantified characteristics. The claimed realism of the game is therefore based, among other things, on the reliability of a constantly-updated database of hundreds of thousands of real football players. The community of gamers, organized in forums and networks around the world are de facto involved in a co-construction of a database which no organization would be able to set up. Yet, Football Manager is also a piece of commercial software, and a performative computer model in the football world: its database is becoming a key issue in the real life football world and this issue provokes debates and tensions in the gaming community.

We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light rail stations, and how more community-based policing starting in late 2018, impacted crime. A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) and non-reclassified crimes by probing publicly available databases from 2006 to 2019.  We compare data before and after passage of Proposition 47, city-wide and within eight neighborhoods. Similar analyses are conducted within a 450 meter radius of the new transit stations. Reports of monthly reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. The reported incidence of larceny intensified throughout the city. Two new train stations, including Downtown, reported significant crime increases in their vicinity after service began. While the number of reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, those not affected by the new law decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 strongly impacted crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new policing measures that enhanced outreach and patrolling. These findings may be relevant to law enforcement and policy-makers.

To address this issue, we study the relationship among affirmative action programs (binding gender quotas and non-binding gender targets), director networks, and the number of board positions individual directors hold given their gender. We use personal, professional, and network characteristics of 25,127 unique directors from 2,435 public firms in 32 European countries over the period of 2000 through 2017. We find that in the absence of affirmative action programs, women directors benefit less from their networks than men directors suggesting the existence of a gender gap in network benefits. After the passage of binding gender quotas, this gender gap in network benefits narrows between women and men directors. Overall, this research suggests that binding gender quotas make director networks a more salient tool for hiring women and may help in leveling the playing field in the way these networks are used for achieving top management positions.",TRUE,FALSE,affirmative action programs|corporate boards|gender inequality|quotas|social networks,2020-05-04T15:03:09.999704,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-30T11:21:49.879259,FALSE,NA,no,"Our study involves both data without sharing restrictions, and data owned by third-party organizations for which we do not have the sharing rights.

This study uses data from 1.3 million internship postings collected between 2007-2016 in the United States to (1) identify trends in internship education, experience, and skill requirements over the Great Recession and recovery periods; (2) evaluate how these trends correspond to those observed in the traditional labor market; and (3) assess robustness across labor market sectors.  Results indicate that internship education and skill requirements increased substantially throughout the recession and recovery periods, indicative of a longer-term structural shift in employer expectations about internship hiring.  Additionally, growth in internship education and skill requirements largely outpaced growth in non-internship education and skill requirements over the same period, suggesting potential substitution of non-interns with interns.

Yet, it has been very difficult for scholarship to pinpoint exactly how international mobility impacts on research careers. This paper contributes to this question by investigating links between international mobility, research career stage progression and job changes. It does so using a large-scale survey (MORE) which targets researchers based in European universities. The results establish that the profile of international mobility varies by academic research career stage. They also show that for researchers in the established mid-career phase who are working internationally, there are career advancement benefits associated with return mobility to their home country. However, these benefits may reduce if the timing of return is too delayed. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these results for researcher mobility policy in the context of the European Higher Education Area and the European Research Area.",TRUE,FALSE,Research careers|return mobility|scientific mobility,2020-05-04T15:03:01.730716,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-30T11:19:00.374831,TRUE,Carolina Cañibano wishes to declare that she was contracted as an expert by IDEA Consult to provide advice on the Spanish institutional framework for Higher Education and Research Careers.

In recent years, there has been growing attention to forests as an effective way to mitigate climate change as they capture and store large quantities of CO2 as phytomass and in the soil. Numerous forestation programs have been rolled out internationally and governments, mostly in the developing world, have been fostering tree planting initiatives. However, there is a paucity of studies that assess local perceptions to these initiatives and there are virtually no studies that do so in countries recovering from long-term conflict such as Somalia. Here, we analyze the factors that motivate or hinder the perception of young people in Somalia about forestation as a means to mitigate climate change. This demographic was targeted because 75% of the population of Somalia is between the ages of 18 and 35. Our results show that biocentric value orientation, which emphasizes environmental preservation and ecosystem maintenance, has significant positive influence on attitudes towards forestation whereas anthropocentric value orientation, which treats forests as an instrumental value to humans, did not show a significant influence. A surprising discovery was that biocentric value orientation also had a direct positive influence on young people’s intentions to adopt forestation as a strategy to mitigate climate. We also found that risk perception has a significant positive influence on attitude towards forestation as it is a critical driver of collective action against human-induced environmental problems.
