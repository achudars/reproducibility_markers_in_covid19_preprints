Several attempts have been undertaken by different government organizations, local government institutions, and non-government organizations in recent years to empower the women in various facets- social, economic and political for the least. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the women empowerment status in a rural area in Khulna district, Bangladesh. Physical surveys were conducted among the households in the Chakrakhali village under Jalma Union in Batiaghata Upazilla of Khulna district. The samples were randomly drawn from the families in the area irrespective of economic, social or religious characteristics. All the respondents were adult women- either the household head of women lead household or the housewife of the family. The social, economic, and political empowerment status of the women in the village was evaluated through the study. The findings from the survey indicate the women are empowered mostly in the economic realm, followed by social empowerment. The political empowerment of the women of that village found to be absent in most cases. The survey results also indicated that the household heads hinder the political and social empowerment status of the women in a male-lead household. In these types of families, despite the monetary or other supports form the institutions is delivered to the women, they are not the own making the decisions. It is found that a lot of the choices of the women are influenced by the household head, mainly to borrow money from micro-credit organizations. The understanding between government organizations and women are not in good shape as women are not interested in the functions of these organizations in most of the cases. Mainly the non-government organizations (i.e., CSS, BUREAU Bangladesh, ASA, PROSHIKA, BRAC, Grameen Bank, etc.) work for the villagers, and women are more concerned about the activities of these institutions.

The common interpretation of “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” fails to explicitly recognize their interdependence with needs of current and future non-human generations. Here we argue that the focus of sustainability on human well-being – a purely utilitarian view of nature as a resource for humanity – limits its conceptual and analytical power, as well as real-world sustainability transformation efforts. We propose a broadened concept of ‘multispecies sustainability’ by acknowledging interdependent needs of multiple species’ current and future generations. We develop the concept in three steps: 1) discussing normative aspects, fundamental principles underlying the concept, and potential visual models, 2) showcasing radically diverging futures emerging from a scenario thought experiment based on the axes sustainable-unsustainable and multispecies-anthropocentric, and 3) exploring how multispecies sustainability can be applied to research and policy-making through two case studies (a multispecies stakeholder framework and the Healthy Urban Microbiome Initiative).",TRUE,FALSE,anthropocene|cybernetics|for the love of bees|governance|microbiome|more-than-human|sustainability|sustainable development goals,2020-09-04T13:21:42.754903,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-04T13:20:25.310311,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/citation/,8j53u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3087c7021ce200a8f42259/,5f3087c7021ce200a8f42259,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8j53u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8j53u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8j53u,https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.28

While an organization may have a central mission, internally, its membership can be diverse. This can pose a challenge to a member-driven organization to implement programming and advocacy that reflects its membership’s preference and likelihood of supporting those programs. Systematic assessment of members’ opinions and preferences is needed to assure alignment with the organization’s actions. Using the North American Falconers Association (NAFA) as a case study, preferences and opinions on issues related to raptor conservation were assessed. Based on species, habitat, management, and policy topic areas, results indicate participants define conservation as encompassing both habitat and species. Consensus habitat issues were threats to prairies, sage, and wetlands.  Perceived declines in native game bird, waterfowl, and small game mammals were the most salient threats to wildlife. Tied to these concerns of habitat and species was access to land to practice falconry. Overall, participants prefer that organizational resources are used to support habitat conservation and facilitate falconers’ access to those habitats. For non-governmental conservation organizations, systematic membership surveys can provide substantial insight for decision-making and effective allocation of membership-derived resources. Member surveys also signal an organizations willingness to listen to its constituents and act upon their views and local knowledge to coordinate conservation action.",TRUE,FALSE,Birds of prey|Conservation social science|Falconer|Human dimensions|Public opinion research,2020-08-11T07:10:02.271205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T07:09:51.121234,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12093492,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication,Kenneth E Wallen,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/citation/,uapv8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f300db1479288009385f8d1/,5f300db1479288009385f8d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uapv8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uapv8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uapv8,NA

Evidence from experiments on support for carbon taxation,"We shed new light on a long-standing question in political science: when confronted with costly policy-choices, do citizens form their preferences based on material (economic) concerns or other-regarding motivations, such as the societal distribution of costs, and how these are moderated by political ideology. Using the case of carbon taxation, a widely advocated policy solution to climate change, we conducted survey experiments in Germany and the United States to assess the relative importance of these forms of preferences. The results show that individuals are primarily concerned with how a carbon tax would impact their individual income. These findings are generally consistent across individuals in both countries, regardless of whether they are left, right, or green, although German respondents are more receptive to redistributive policy design.

Empirical observations were made in the Glatt Valley of Switzerland, where governing officials of small municipalities are confronted with coordinating urban development under growth pressure within cantonal and federal policy frameworks that claim sustainable development.

However, there are difficulties in the valid and reliable assessment of features of quality within designerly outputs. In light of recent educational reforms in Ireland, which see the introduction of classroom based assessments centring on design in the technology subjects, it is paramount that the implementation of design assessment is critically considered. An exploratory study was conducted with a 1st year cohort of initial technology teacher education students (N = 126) which involved them completing a design assignment and subsequent assessment process through the use of adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ). In considering the use of ACJ as a potential tool for design assessment at post-primary level, data analysis focused on criteria used for assessment. Results indicate that quantitative variables, i.e., the amount of work done, can significantly predict performance (R2 = .333, p &lt;.001), however qualitative findings suggest that quantity may simply align with quality. Further results illustrate a significant yet practically meaningless bias may exist in the judgement of work through ACJ (φ = .082, p &lt;.01) and that there was need to use varying criteria in the assessment of design outputs.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptive comparative judgement|assessment|design|educational reform|technology education,2020-08-08T18:08:49.547175,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-08T18:08:18.711858,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon request from corresponding author,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/citation/,ys9eg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2e7eec479288007685a142/,5f2e7eec479288007685a142,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ys9eg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ys9eg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ys9eg,NA

Worry can be a negative and debilitating experience that damages mental health and discourages healthy re-engagement with the world, but it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing people’s attention to problems, and encouraging them to act accordingly. We present in this paper a way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between “functional fear” and “dysfunctional fear.” Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (adaptive emotions encourage proactive behaviours to reduce the chance of infection) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (quality of life is damaged by the emotional experience or taking ineffective or damaging precautions). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we compare perceptions of risk (differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence) for each group, and find a difference between the dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups. Our findings inform what sort of content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our measurement scheme for future research.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|precautions|re-engagement|risk|wellbeing|worry,2020-08-08T18:06:01.433610,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-08T18:05:36.114137,FALSE,NA,no,"Data come from the 'Policing the Pandemic' longitudinal survey, which has its own OSF project here: https://osf.io/4vje3/",,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/citation/,2kfs6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jwx2k/,jwx2k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2e45cf479288006b85f420/,5f2e45cf479288006b85f420,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kfs6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2kfs6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2kfs6,NA
