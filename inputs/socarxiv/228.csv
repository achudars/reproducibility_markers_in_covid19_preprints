Socio–economic variables that drive participation and impact of participation have been studied, but the contextual process that stir up local community participation remains understudied. In this paper, we studied factors facilitating community participation in three wildlife conservation projects in Northeast India. Through ethnographic fieldwork at these sites we identified conservation actors and examined interactions between them.
We found common modes of participation at these sites and these were related to gaining material incentives, providing labour, attending consultative workshops. Levels of interaction and coercion were found to be different in three sites. Three critical factors that drive participation were: (1) trigger, (2) negotiation and (3) sustenance. Trigger factors kickstart participation through establishment of a crisis narrative and facilitation by external actors. Negotiation factors emerge from day–to–day interaction between local community and external actors and involve effective entry stage activities, income opportunity, mediating voices within the community and intra–community dynamics. Sustenance factors affect the long term participation by community in the conservation project and involve tangible/intangible results, capability development of locals, funding and availability to critical information. 
In our paper we argue that investment of time and fund to understand the stakeholders and their concept of participation, periodic feedback sessions, capacity development of locals for self–mobilization, innovative information dissemination and securing long term funding are necessary for effective local community participation.",TRUE,FALSE,community-based Conservation|Interaction|Northeast India|participation|Participation; Wildlife; Community–Based Conservation; India; Interaction; Northeast India|wildlife,2020-07-14T05:02:41.583615,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-14T05:02:22.802196,FALSE,NA,no,"The data is in the form of interview transcripts, which are confidential due to ethical guidelines.

A framework for understanding how to mitigate false consensus,"Mindfulness has recently attracted a great deal of interest in the field of management. However, even though mindfulness – broadly viewed as a state of active awareness – has been described mainly at the individual level, it may also have important effects at aggregated levels. In this article, we adopt a team-based conceptualization of mindfulness, and develop a framework that represents the powerful effect of team mindfulness on facilitating effective decision-making. We further discuss how a conceptualization of team mindfulness may mitigate the process of false consensus by interacting positively with the following five central team processes: open-mindedness, participation, empowerment, conflict management, and value and ambiguity tolerance. A false consensus constitutes a cognitive bias, leading to the perception of a consensus that does not exist. In essence, we argue that, although a conceptualization of team mindfulness does not guarantee effective decision-making in itself, it may successfully reduce false consensus when coupled with these five team processes. Accordingly, this article contributes to the theory and practice of team decision-making by demonstrating how a conceptualization of team mindfulness can be helpful in the increasingly complex and ambiguous situations faced by contemporary teams.",TRUE,FALSE,decision making|false consensus|organizations|sensemaking|team mindfulness,2020-07-11T22:24:01.283009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-11T22:23:36.043327,FALSE,NA,no,The article is conceptual and does not include any data,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/citation/,kh9aq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f08d315a6ea6e0063fb6b8a/,5f08d315a6ea6e0063fb6b8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kh9aq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kh9aq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kh9aq,https://doi.org/10.1111/emre.12415

This became an objective to study a rise in the number of violence during coronavirus lockdown.

The understanding of norms cannot remain error free until seen from the lens of policy implication. It will give a ground reality of its existence.

It tries to investigate how EFL teachers in Abu Hayyan al-Tawhidi high school respond to students’ compositions. Strong emphasis is laid on the types of teacher written feedback, with a focus on integrated feedback (form and content) as an effective way to respond to students’ written work. The ultimate goal of this paper is to ascertain the types and forms of teacher written feedback prevalent amongst Moroccan EFL high school teachers. In this light, the study seeks to investigate the following research questions: (1) Which types of written feedback do Moroccan high school EFL teachers employ to respond to students’ compositions? (2) Which forms of written feedback do Moroccan high school EFL teachers’ employ to respond to students’ compositions? To answer these questions, the present study used a mixed method approach that included: classroom observation checklist, document analysis of corrected writing productions and students’ questionnaire. The key findings illustrated that teachers at Abu Hayyan al-Tawhidi high school relied heavily on form-focused feedback. It also revealed that teachers opted for correction symbols and commentary.",TRUE,FALSE,EDUCATION|EFL|FEEDBACK|HIGH SCHOOL|PEDAGOGY|TEACHING|TEFL,2020-07-11T22:23:30.475902,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-11T22:22:57.144033,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://ijier.net/ijier/article/view/2472,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/citation/,5bdr9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f089490ca360e0097b02236/,5f089490ca360e0097b02236,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5bdr9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5bdr9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5bdr9,https://doi.org/10.31686/ijier.vol8.iss7.2472

A qualitative interview study of public and private health providers in Brazil’s São Paulo and Maranhão states","Background. Economic recessions carry an impact on population health and access to care; less is known on how health systems adapt to the conditions brought by a downturn. This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the world’s most affected countries, and its health system was already living the aftermath of the 2015 recession. 
Methods. Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (São Paulo) and impoverished (Maranhão) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings.
Results. We found the concept of ‘health sector crisis’ to be politically charged among healthcare providers in São Paulo and Maranhão. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexible – if insecure – working arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranhão.
Conclusions. The ‘plates’ of a health system may shift and adjust in unexpected ways in response to recessions, and some of these changes might outlast the crisis. As low-income countries enter post-COVID recessions, it will be important to monitor the adjustments taking place in health systems, to ensure that past gains in access to care and job security are not eroded.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazil health system;|covid-19 and health systems;|economic recession and health;|health services in LMICs;,2020-07-12T19:49:44.038896,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-12T19:49:20.440036,FALSE,NA,no,Interview transcripts can be obtained from the authors upon request,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",Giuliano Russo,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/citation/,qtgux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f08775a58a9e700847e3e03/,5f08775a58a9e700847e3e03,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qtgux/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qtgux,NA
