One of the most common and preferred teaching strategies is the use of language games to aid the teaching of various skills. The growth of digital learning tools and web applications being used in lessons taking the use of language games to a modern and advanced platform for learners to engage in lessons. The use of interesting and suitable materials along with the various approaches when conducting language games during lessons helps to cater to learners' needs and interests on the subject-matter especially in learning grammar in context. Many researches have used various language games to show its effects on learners ' knowledge, competency and motivation in learning a language, focusing on different targeted language areas and skills such as grammar. Therefore, this paper, based on reviews of past literature, will explore the use of language games in teaching and learning grammar, with reference to second language (ESL) learners.

Particularly, the paper attempts to analyze transitivity or process types from a semantic-grammatical point of view based on Halliday's (1985) framework of Systemic Functional Grammar. The study aims to describe and compare the process types used by the authors to transmit their experiences/ideations and fulfill the intended purposes. To this end, eight articles from Washington Post (WP) &amp; Arab News (AN) online newspapers were analyzed. The selected texts were divided into clauses and the process types (material, mental, relational, verbal, existential &amp; behavior) were identified and compared. The analysis reveals that the authors of both newspapers give prominence to the use of material and relational processes seeming to focus exclusively on the actions of physical nature and make links between actions and actors with some qualities associated with them. The subsequently used processes in WP articles are verbal, mental and existential; whereas in AN articles they are mental, existential and verbal. Behavior process is the last and least frequently used process type in both newspapers articles showing that the physiological responses of the actors are not a major involvement. However, the rates of process types in all articles of both newspapers differ considerably. This variation is ascribed to the authors' choice to include a process type more than the other or exclude another to transmit their own experiences and bring about the intended purpose.",TRUE,FALSE,ideational meaning|process types|systemic functional grammar|transitivity,2019-07-20T21:36:42.401319,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:36:23.008405,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/citation/,ydvgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa4ddddf977b001af3d831/,5caa4ddddf977b001af3d831,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydvgs/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydvgs

Furthermore, a model of a teaching program, based on using DST strategy, is improved and tested with a group of learners at the chosen university in Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that the learners at the selected university find difficulty in speaking English, and that applying DST as a pedagogy help the students to develop their overall speaking skill.

In the present work, Langacker’s cognitive linguistic theory of domains (1987) is adopted to provide a new sight into vocabulary learning, and to expand the vocabulary repertoire of Iraqi students. This paper aims at testing the validity of expanding the English vocabulary of L2 Iraqi learners throughout the theory of domains. It also tries to find  how  can domains theory increase the package of vocabulary for L2 learners. Accordingly, an experimental study is to be conducted on forty-six college students of second-year level from, University of Baghdad, Iraq. The data of the pre-test and post-test were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) l editor. Results have shown the following: First, the progress of more than (0.05≤) has been detected as far as students' understanding of the semantic domains of the lexical concepts. Second, the main source of difficulty regarding vocabulary acquisition has been treated throughout Langacker's theory. Third, the domains theory has proven its effectiveness in accurately comprehending the semantic domains of the English lexical concepts.",TRUE,FALSE,Cognitive semantics|domains|Iraqi Learners|lexical concept,2019-07-20T21:33:02.785109,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:32:40.183757,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/citation/,v3e42,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa48e2641d100019bf7103/,5caa48e2641d100019bf7103,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3e42/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v3e42/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v3e42

The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of using peer assessment training on writing performance among Arab EFL high school students. One hundred and twenty students aged fifteen and sixteen years old participated in this study with an equal number of male and female students. The students were from two Arab high schools in Malaysia. This study employed a quasi-experimental research design. Data was collected using Analytical Marking Scale (Alderson, et al., 1995) to assess student’s writing performance in the pretest and posttest. The result of this study shows that there is a significant difference in the writing performances between the experimental and control groups at P &lt; 0.001. The findings suggests that students who have been exposed to peer assessment training write a better draft compared with those students who were only given conventional training in writing an essay, and without the benefit of peer feedback.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab EFL|peer assessment|writing performance,2019-07-20T21:32:44.057793,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:32:17.505140,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/citation/,6ufgq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa4811641d10001bbf0969/,5caa4811641d10001bbf0969,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ufgq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ufgq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ufgq
