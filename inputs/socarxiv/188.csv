This article uses transcript data from a medium-sized American university to describe three enrollment networks that connect students through classes, and in the process create social conditions for the spread of infectious disease: an university-wide network, an undergraduate-only network, and a liberal arts college network. All three networks are “small worlds” characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent paths connecting students. Students from different majors cluster together, but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and less than two-thirds in four steps. In all simulations, most students are connected through multiple independent paths.

We fielded a survey of LGBTQ Americans’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic collected from April 10 to May 10, 2020, an important time period during which most states issued stay-at-home orders (April 10 to April 30) and also began implementing phased reopening (May 1 to May 10). In this paper, we limit analyses to a subsample of 728 gay and bisexual men and focus on changes to sexual behavior in response to the pandemic. We find that many gay and bisexual men made significant changes to their sexual behavior and partner selection. Nine out of 10 men in our sample reported having either one sexual partner or no sexual partner in the last 30 days, which, for many, was a substantial decrease compared to just before the pandemic. Men also made changes to the kinds of partners they had and their sexual activities with partners (e.g., more virtual sex), engaged in new strategies to reduce their risks of infection from partners, and expressed high levels of concern about how HIV may affect COVID-19 risk, treatment, and recovery. We expect these changes to be important not only for reducing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but also for reducing new sexually transmitted infections.

This present paper analyzed the general scenario of refugee integration through the lenses of a study case of the Syrian Refugees in Rio de Janeiro. The question this research aims to answer is if the considered progressive Brazilian integration laws are actually causing a process of invisibilization. The title takes an ontological stand and supports the sociological concept of the word “invisibilization”, since the object of interest is in fact the gradual process of turning invisible. The analysis of this project consists in literature review, interview with a specialist on the topic of Syrian Refugees in Rio de Janeiro, interpretation of open interviews with three refugees living in Rio and participative observation in a field research at a Refugee Festival. Analyzing all the data and personal depositions, the analysis points to two main categories of challenges for Syrian Refugees trying to integrate: a cultural isolation and local social barriers. Both types correspond to detachments from forms of their identity: isolated from their identity in Syria and not integrated enough to have an identity in Brazil.

The COVID-19 pandemic is both a global health crisis, and a civic emergency for national governments, including the UK.  With currently no vaccine and no treatment, there is no medical solution. Consequently, the questions for evidence and policy are complex, draw on multiple streams, and are about management rather than medicine.  This working paper sets out models and methods for a forthcoming study to analyse the interaction of evidence and policy in the first 100 days of the UK government’s response to COVID-19.
MODELS
Drawing on chaos theory and insights from the policy sciences, three models of evidence-based policy are discussed: a linear cipher model, a multiple streams model, and a melee model.  The nonlinear melee model is adopted for the forthcoming study, in which multiple forms of evidence (science, economic, political, social) and actors interact in real time, and supposedly independent evidence streams concomitantly consider evidence from other streams, creating an apparently chaotic melee in which it is unclear where, how and by whom decisions originate or are made.  This is normal, and much closer to how policy decisions emerge than the process represented by rational, ideal-type, linear models.
METHODS
DESIGN: An analysis of evidence in and of the policy response to COVID-19 by the UK government for the 100 days from 1st February 2020 to 11th May 2020 will be undertaken.
DATA: Three data sources will be accessed: papers from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and its feeder groups and committees; formal government statements, information and guidance; BBC News coverage of government press briefings and further documents and/or coverage snowballing from them.
ANALYSIS: A thematic content analysis, pre-structured by the four evidence streams in the melee model, will be undertaken to identify critical incidents for a strict contemporaneous analysis using only information available at the time of the incident, and referring only to the contemporaneous context for the incident.  
ASSUMPTIONS: Illustrative critical incidents will be sufficient to provide evidence for the explanatory utility of the melee model. Comprehensive coverage of all incidents would unnecessarily super-saturate the analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Evidence; policy; melee model; COVID-19; chaos theory; policy sciences,2020-06-01T16:26:45.205417,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T10:33:57.072147,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/citation/,f73u4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed147b817ac9e03826243d4/,5ed147b817ac9e03826243d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f73u4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f73u4,NA

For that, there are approx. 20 software packages. Two of them are GABEK/WinRelan® and ATLAS.ti™, which are less used than others. The aims of this study are (1) to compare directly both tools with each other by applying the tools, using a pre-interview and (2) to conduct expert interviews to come to a better understanding of how and why either GABEK/WinRelan® or ATLAS.ti™is used. As qualitative research is helpful to answer questions associated with hypothesis-generating research processes, such as quantitative methods, this paper aims (3) how those qualitative approaches can be analyzed by computer-assisted software. This paper conducted a literature review of both CAQDAS and applied the tools by using a pre-interview for the first comparison of both tools. In the further research, it is planned to conduct expert interviews with users to collect data for a deeper direct comparison of both tools. The results at this stage show that (1) there is no direct comparison of both tools, (2) GABEK/WinRelan® is less know than ATLAS.ti™ and (3) there are differences between the two tools, such as up-to-dateness and user friendliness. The paper concludes at this stage, that both tools have their advantages and disadvantages. GABEK/WinRelan® is with its “Gestalten”-approach (perceptive appearance of holistic processing of complexity) is a deep analysis tool, whereas ATLAS.ti™ has many functions, will be kept up-to-date and is more widespread within the scientific community.",TRUE,FALSE,|ATLAS.ti|CAQDAS|GABEK|Qualitative Research|WinRelan,2020-06-01T16:26:40.337500,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T10:23:51.337033,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/citation/,jqmue,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rsjeu/,rsjeu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed114a417ac9e0366622b48/,5ed114a417ac9e0366622b48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqmue/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jqmue/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jqmue,NA

Explanations offered for these inequalities have relied on assumptions about genetic predispositions and peculiar ‘cultural’ behaviours. But, beyond a very small number of health conditions, there is no evidence that such genetic or cultural differences explain ethnic inequalities in Covid-19 or any other health conditions. 

Organisations focused on supporting the BAME population are not focused on genetic/cultural explanations, but the racism which leads to the socioeconomic differences which are so important for explaining differences in Covid-19 deaths. And how it also leads to long-term stress which causes cardiovascular disease, and other health problems like obesity.

Emerging evidence shows that these influences reach into all aspects of health-related outcomes. But these ethnic disparities in experiences of the pandemic are not being given sufficient attention. This is partly due to this focus on a search for genetic explanations for societal problems.",TRUE,FALSE,Behaviour|Biology|Coronavirus|Covid-19|Culture|Ethnicity|Genetics|Poverty|Racism|Structure,2020-06-01T16:26:35.566850,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T03:36:42.907706,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,Dr Catherine Dodds &amp; Dr Saffron Karlsen|University of Bristol,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/citation/,5gbrz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed106d3aeeb6d0363084df6/,5ed106d3aeeb6d0363084df6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5gbrz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5gbrz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5gbrz,NA
