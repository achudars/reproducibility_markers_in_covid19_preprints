Exceptions in the literature to date have relied on relatively broad, subjective measures of religious commitment, largely ignoring issues of religious belonging, belief, or practice. This study moves the conversation forward by examining how a variety of state-level religious factors predict Google searches for the term “porn,” net of relevant sociodemographic and ideological controls. Our multivariate findings indicate that higher percentages of evangelical Protestants, theists, and Biblical literalists in a state predict higher frequencies of searching for “porn,” as do higher church attendance rates. Conversely, higher percentages of religiously unaffiliated persons in a state predict lower frequencies of searching for “porn.” Higher percentages of total religious adherents, Catholics, or Mainline Protestants in a state are unrelated to searching for “porn” with controls in place. Contrary to recent research, our analyses also show that higher percentages of political conservatives in a state predicted lower frequencies of “porn” searches. Our findings support theories that more salient, traditional religious influences in a state may influence residents—whether religious or not—toward more covert sexual experiences.",TRUE,FALSE,Evangelicals|Google|Google Trends|Political Conservatism|Porn|Pornography|Religion|State-level Data,2018-07-02T11:05:28.882966,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-08T17:50:23.803405,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/citation/,fpq9x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ewj5r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/relationships/node/,ewj5r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5989f972594d900229f225e3/,5989f972594d900229f225e3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpq9x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fpq9x/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2017.1278736,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fpq9x

Prior research tends to focus on determining which congregations are most likely to be inclusive of lesbians and gays. One puzzle still remains, however. Among those inclusive congregations that integrate gays and lesbians into congregational life, why do some adopt a formal organizational statement of welcoming while others do not? Drawing on the New Institutionalism and inhabited institutions literatures, this study is the first quantitative examination of the concept of “loose coupling” within religious organizations regarding homosexuality. Analyses using nationally representative congregational data (National Congregations Study) indicate that particular types of inclusive congregations are more likely to loosely couple their practical activity from their formal organizational stance. These findings suggest that inclusive religious organizations respond to myths and norms from various organizational fields and that agentic actors inhabiting the organization influence it by responding, interpreting, and making sense of those institutional norms. The analyses also indicate that loose coupling is one avenue through which particular types of religious organizations respond to the transformation of societal norms with innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,Congregations|Homosexuality|Inhabited Institutions|Loose Coupling|New Institutionalism|Religious Organizations|United States,2018-07-02T11:05:28.852461,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-08T17:15:30.909836,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/citation/,xtk7m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qv283/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/relationships/node/,qv283,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5989f0f66c613b022987f679/,5989f0f66c613b022987f679,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xtk7m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xtk7m/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xtk7m

Capital Markets Union and the quest for macroeconomic stabilization in the euro area","This paper argues that Capital Markets Union – the EU’s attempt to establish a more market-based financial system – is a result less of financial policymaking than of macroeconomic governance in a politically fractured polity. The current governance structure of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) severely limits the capacity of both national and supranational actors to provide a core public good, macroeconomic stabilization. While member states have institutionalized fiscal austerity and abandoned other macroeconomic levers, the European polity lacks the fiscal resources necessary to achieve stable macroeconomic conditions: smoothing the business cycle, ensuring growth and job creation, and mitigating the impact of asymmetric output shocks on consumption. Capital Markets Union, we argue, is an attempt by European policymakers to devise a financial fix for this structural capacity gap. Using its regulatory powers, the European Commission, supported by the European Central Bank (ECB), seeks to harness private financial markets and instruments to provide the public policy good of macroeconomic stabilization. We trace how technocrats, think tanks, and financial-sector lobbyists, through the strategic use of knowledge and expertise, established securitization and market-based finance as solutions to EMU’s governance problems.",TRUE,FALSE,ECB|euro area|European Commission|financial markets|fiscal policy|Regulation|securitisation,2018-07-02T11:05:28.079911,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-07T14:48:17.866161,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,Benjamin Braun|Marina Hübner,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/citation/,vqgjt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7hycj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/relationships/node/,7hycj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59887c5eb83f69023fe325e9/,59887c5eb83f69023fe325e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqgjt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vqgjt/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1024529417753555,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vqgjt

It therefore discusses in critical terms how large parts of Kachin society understand the ceasefire era and the reasons for its collapse in 2011. It focuses particularly on popular understandings of the large-scale resource grabs that defined much of that era. The chapter lays out a dominant Kachin nationalist-theoretical framework by discussing three core terms: Wunpawng Mungdan (territory/ ‘Kachin country’), Wunpawng myusha (people/ ‘Kachin nation’), and Karai Kasang (divinity/ Christian ‘God’). The chapter then tackles how Kachin nationalists deploy these terms in specific ways to understand their 1994-2011 ceasefire experiences; in doing so, they express ideas of ethno-national emergency, divine predestination, and ethnocidal conspiracy. These understandings guide many people in Kachin society to commit to resistance and the ethno-patriotic project of co-building a ‘land yet-to-be’, instead of engaging in a ceasefire based on compromise. Amid the current battles, anger and humanitarian crisis, the question of whether one wants ‘our Kachin nation’ to pursue full state independence or merely federal autonomy within Myanmar has become a sensitive and barely voiced debate inside Kachin society. While exploring these theories and popular analyses, this chapter steps into an open critical dialogue with Kachin nationalists themselves, suggesting ways in which these understandings are contradicted or complicated by other social realities. This is to draw a fuller, fairer, and more balanced picture of the complex social dynamics in this region. Simultaneously, the chapter cautions against the tendency to make homogenising claims about Burma’s minority ethnic nations, as if these were simple, monolithic entities rather than the internally diverse, class-stratified and complex societies that in fact they are.

During the New York Climate Week in 2014, I saw Naomi Klein speak about her new book, This Changes Everything. She inscribed my copy, with the message ‘Stay Brave.’ Naomi Klein was a dynamic, energetic public intellectual during the hectic series of events in September. She launched her book at The New School; attended a civic meeting, with Bill McKibben, Bernie Sanders, Kshama Sawant, Chris Hedges, and Brian Lehrer; and spoke at Brooklyn Book Fair. Naomi Klein has promoted community-led responses to climate change — such as the People’s Climate March. She was a prominent figure at the 400,000 strong People’s Climate March through the streets of New York on the 21 September 2014. She highlighted the Flood Wall Street protests over the linkages between capitalism and climate change on the 22 September 2014. Naomi Klein offered a critique of the outcome of the United Nations Climate Summit on the 23 September 2014.

Naomi Klein made her name in 2000 with the brilliant book, No Logo — a mythbusting work about trans-national companies and their well-known trade marks, and the Mad Men of advertising and marketing. She displayed a strong interest in critical responses to Big Brands — looking at the tactics of culture-jamming, AdBusting, and the No Logo Movement. In 2002, Naomi Klein published Fences and Windows. This collection of work particularly focused upon battles over globalisation. In 2007, Naomi Klein published The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. This book is particularly interested in how free market neo-liberal policies have been foisted upon nation states at times of crisis, disaster, war, and shock. At the Copenhagen Climate talks in 2009, Naomi Klein showed a strong interest in climate debt. Since then, she has joined the board of 350.org, promoted fossil fuel divestment, and has written a number of pieces on climate change. Naomi Klein was particularly concerned about the impact of Hurricane Sandy upon New York. Her 2014 book This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs The Climate represents the culmination of this intellectual engagement with climate change. This Changes Everything is also being transformed into a documentary film by Avi Lewis.

In her literary style, Naomi Klein is a writer of sweet reason and cool logic. (Such characteristics no doubt enrage her critics — climate deniers and sceptics have been particularly incensed by This Changes Everything). Having deconstructed brands and turned them inside-out, Naomi Klein has a gift for marketing. Her writing is often pithy and epigrammatic. Naomi Klein is also an empathetic soul. She is sympathetic to the particular human costs of climate change. Naomi Klein has great intellectual curiosity. She ranges far and wide, in terms of her subject matter, and the geographic spread of her investigations. Naomi Klein is also a fearless critic. She is brave, gutsy, and always willing to speak truth to power. Naomi Klein is also not afraid to criticise fellow travellers for their compromises and hypocrisy. She shows courage in her call for climate action.",TRUE,FALSE,Capitalism|Civil Society|Climate Change|Climate Debt|Climate Justice|Environmental Philosophy|Fossil Fuel Divestment|Geoengineering|Human Rights|Indigenous Rights|International Law|Loss and Damage|Politics|Renewable Energy,2018-07-02T11:05:27.746119,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-05T12:19:19.216023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/citation/,xwf65,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cteum/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/relationships/node/,cteum,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57db89f56c613b01e1057893/,57db89f56c613b01e1057893,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwf65/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xwf65/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xwf65

University of Western Australia Law Review, 41(2), pp. 51-84.

There has been much interest in how intellectual property law, policy, and practice will adapt to the emergence of 3D printing and the maker movement. Intellectual property lawyers will have to grapple with the impact of additive manufacturing upon a variety of forms of intellectual property – including copyright law, trade mark law, designs law, patent law, and trade secrets. The disruptive technology of 3D printing will both pose opportunities and challenges for legal practitioners and policy-makers.

Rather than try to survey this expanding field, this article considers a number of early conflicts and skirmishes in respect of copyright law and 3D printing. There has been significant interest in the impact of 3D printing on copyright law and the creative industries. There have been classic issues raised about copyright subsistence, and the overlap between copyright law and designs. There has also been a moral panic about 3D printing facilitating copyright infringement – like peer to peer networks such as Napster in the past. There has been a use of open licensing models such as Creative Commons licensing to facilitate the sharing of 3D printing files. Such battles highlight a conflict between the open culture of the Maker Movement, and the closed culture of copyright industries. In many ways, such conflicts touch upon classic issues involved in ‘information environmentalism’. Part II looks at the controversy over Left Shark. In particular, it examines the copyright claims of Katy Perry in respect of the Left Shark figure. Part III considers questions about scanning. Augustana College tried to assert copyright against a maker, Jerry Fisher, who was scanning statues of Michelangelo (although copyright had long since expired in such work). Part IV focuses upon copyright law, 3D printing and readymades. The Estate of Marcel Duchamp lodged a copyright protest over a 3D printed set of chess, based on the work of Marcel Duchamp.

3D printing is a field of technology, which enabled the manufacturing of physical objects from three-dimensional digital models.

The discipline of copyright law has been challenged and disrupted by the emergence of 3D printing and additive manufacturing. 3D Printing poses questions about the subject matter protected under copyright law. Copyright law provides for exclusive economic and moral rights in respect of cultural works – such as literary works, artistic works, musical works, dramatic works, as well as other subject matter like radio and television broadcasts, sound recordings, and published editions. Copyright law demands a threshold requirement of originality. There have been sometimes issues about the interaction between copyright law and designs law in respect of works of artistic craftsmanship. In addition, 3D printing has raised larger questions about copyright infringement. There has been significant debate over the scope of copyright exceptions – such as the defence of fair dealing, and exceptions for cultural institutions. Moreover, there has been debate over the operation of digital copyright measures in respect of 3D printing. The takedown and notice system has affected services and sites, which enable the sharing of 3D printing designs. Technological protection measures – digital locks – have also raised challenges for 3D printing. The long duration of copyright protection in Australia and the United States has also raised issues in respect of 3D printing.

There has been great public policy interest into how copyright law will address and accommodate the disruptive technologies of 3D Printing. As a public policy expert at Public Knowledge, and as a lawyer working for Shapeways, Michael Weinberg has written a number of public policy papers on intellectual property and 3D Printing. Associate Professor Dinusha Mendis and her colleagues have undertaken legal and empirical research on intellectual property and 3D printing. In 2015, Professor Mark Lemley from Stanford Law School wrote about intellectual property and 3D printing in the context of work on the economics of abundance. As a practising lawyer, John Hornick has examined the topic of intellectual property and 3D printing. Comparative legal scholar Dr Angela Daly has written on the socio-legal aspects of 3D printing in 2016. The World Intellectual Property Organization in 2015 highlighted 3D printing.

3D printing has provided new opportunities for cultural institutions to redefine their activities and purposes, and engage with a variety of new constituencies. 3D printing has also highlighted deficiencies in copyright law in respect of cultural institutions. Culturally and technologically specific exceptions for libraries, archives, and cultural institutions have proven to be ill-adapted for an age of 3D printing and makerspaces. The Australian Law Reform Commission has highlighted the need to modernise Australia’s copyright laws for the digital age. Likewise, the Productivity Commission has considered the question of copyright exceptions in its study of intellectual property arrangements in 2016. The Turnbull Government has contemplated somewhat more modest copyright reforms, with the draft legislation in the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Bill 2016 (Cth). Libraries, galleries, museums, and archives would all benefit from flexible copyright exceptions for cultural institutions to take full advantage of the possibilities of digitisation and 3D printing.",TRUE,FALSE,3d printing|archives|copyright law|cultural heritage|cultural institutions|fabspaces|galleries|libraries|makerspaces|museums,2018-07-02T11:05:27.652109,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-05T11:55:23.412540,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/citation/,e54vn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zph3b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/relationships/node/,zph3b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5985b17db83f690229bedcad/,5985b17db83f690229bedcad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e54vn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e54vn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e54vn

However, the presence of a strong social safety net in these countries has not solved the problem of socioeconomic exclusion, manifesting in such outcomes as chronic unemployment and welfare dependency. In an effort to understand this phenomenon, the current study builds on the assumption that psychological risk factors emerge as important determinants of socioeconomic disadvantage in an environment where ascribed characteristics have less impact on educational and occupational attainment. Using data from Finland, this research examined a life course model linking childhood differences in cognitive skills and antisocial propensity to midlife socioeconomic exclusion. The Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development (n = 369) follows individuals from age 8 (b. 1959) through age 50. Evidence from a structural equation model found support for key theoretical predictions: (1) human capital and antisocial pathways contributed independently to socioeconomic exclusion; (2) the effect of childhood psychological factors on midlife socioeconomic exclusion was mediated by adolescent and adult life course outcomes; and (3) the human capital and antisocial domains intersected such that antisocial children struggled in school as adolescents, which contributed to their persistence in crime and deviance in adulthood – a behavioral pattern that directly increased the risk of socioeconomic exclusion in midlife. In short, the findings suggest that early emerging differences in cognitive ability and antisociality set in motion a process of negative life outcomes with enduring consequences for socioeconomic well-being. The results are discussed from the perspective of socio-historical context and public policy.",TRUE,FALSE,antisocial behavior|Finland|human capital|individual differences|life course|midlife|noncognitive skills|Poverty|social exclusion|socioeconomic disadvantage|welfare state,2018-07-02T11:05:26.488502,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-03T14:43:55.308080,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",© 2016 American Psychological Association.,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/citation/,35w4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jdx6b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/relationships/node/,jdx6b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598334da594d9002409f9fa2/,598334da594d9002409f9fa2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/35w4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/35w4n/,https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000344,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/35w4n

Shrinking cities could utilize vacant land to provide more green space, but declining tax revenues preclude new park development – a situation pronounced in Japan, where some cities are projected to shrink by over ten percent, but lack green space. Could informal urban green spaces (IGS; vacant lots, street verges, brownfields etc.) supplement parks in shrinking cities? This study analyzes residents’ perception, use, and management preferences (management goals, approaches to participatory management, willingness to participate) for IGS using a large, representative online survey (n=1,000) across four major shrinking Japanese cities: Sapporo, Nagano, Kyoto and Kitakyushu. Results show that residents saw IGS as a common element of the urban landscape and their daily lives, but their evaluation was mixed. Recreation and urban agriculture were preferred to redevelopment and non-management. For participative management, residents saw a need for the city administration to mediate usage and liability, and expected an improved appearance, but emphasized the need for financial and non-financial support. A small but significant minority (~10%) were willing to participate in management activities. On this basis, eight principles for participatory informal green space planning are proposed.",TRUE,FALSE,depopulation|green infrastructure|Japan|landscape|land use|participatory management|recreation|urban planning|vacant land|wasteland,2018-07-02T11:05:26.336566,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-03T07:06:22.235490,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/citation/,ug86b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wtmvs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/relationships/node/,wtmvs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5982cabfb83f690228081262/,5982cabfb83f690228081262,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug86b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ug86b/,https://doi.org/10.3390/land6030059,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ug86b
