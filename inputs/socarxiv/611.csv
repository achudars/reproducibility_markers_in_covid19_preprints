This represents an opportunity to examine the relationship between long-term population changes and shoreline change. Based on detailed land change data for the period 1932–2010 and a small area population estimation technique for the period 1940–2010, we examine intra-parish population changes in relation to shoreline changes for the one million plus residents living in the ten coastal parishes of Louisiana. We find that since 1940, only two of the ten coastal parishes exhibited landward population movement, which we define as movement perpendicular to the shoreline, exceeding 1 km. Three parishes exhibited seaward population movement in excess of 1 km. Overall, we find very little net intra-parish landward population movement for the region. Our findings suggest that coastal Louisiana’s historical population has not moved in concert with observed shoreline encroachment. We also find a potential tipping point related to population migration when a neighborhood loses at least 50% of its land area. Our findings suggest that this lack of landward population movement could be attributable to either localized adaptation strategies or migrations to other landward areas.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|coastal populations|Hurricane Katrina|louisiana|migration|sea level rise,2018-07-02T11:45:24.838900,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-22T01:43:59.190071,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/citation/,n7pt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6bz9p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/relationships/node/,6bz9p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab2f679a9e3c8000d724cc1/,5ab2f679a9e3c8000d724cc1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n7pt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n7pt5/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11111-019-00315-8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n7pt5

M.C. Villeval (2014) summarized the main message as follows, in News and Views of the Nature issue where the Cohn study was published: the “experiment shows that although bank employees behave honestly on average, their dishonesty increases when they make decisions after having been primed to think about their professional identity.” Cohn et al. thus provide evidence that “the incentives and the business culture developed in the financial sector may undermine the honesty norms of ordinary employees.” This study may have important consequences for policy, since, Villeval continues, “it is crucial to ensure a business culture of honesty in this industry to restore trust in it.” Villeval also argues that “from a scientific perspective, this study […] supports the economic theory of social identity […], links this theory with the economic analysis of lying behavior [… and] shows how behavioural economists can contribute to a broader reflection in science about how people manage their 'multiple selves' ”. Here I show that the use of flawed statistics methods, yet employed routinely in so-called “evidence-based” science, led the authors to distort the “evidence”. I am also using this data-set as an interesting example to explore how we can use modeling and simulations to provide a fair account of the information and uncertainty conveyed by the data, based on Confidence Intervals.

In particular, associations are tested between the extent of ratio disclosure and company performance (namely profitability, liquidity, leverage, and company efficiency), size and industry. Six hypotheses are tested using data collected from 2003 annual reports of 100 Malaysian listed companies.

Changing shareholding pattern in companies established prior to liberalization and the impact.
Prior to 1991, the Indian economy was averse to policies that diluted the government’s control over the companies established in the country. A closed economy of sorts, the Indian economy perceptibly faced the pressure of global forces as well as internal turbulence's resulting in negative
economic indicators. As a result of the same, the government yielded to the situation and began the process of liberalization. The 1980s saw the advent of these policies through the delicensing of certain key industries which was then followed by the introduction of the New Economic Policy
which laid down the framework of liberalization as a formal reform in the economy in 1991.
Clusters of business groups in India formed around ethnic, religious and social communities, for example, the Marwaris of Rajasthan formed businesses in Bengal and elsewhere; the Gujaratis in the West, the Chettiars in the South, etc. There is a vast diversity in the Indian economy,
comprising of listed as well as unlisted, regional as well as foreign, private as well as public companies. The indigenous entrepreneurs in the Indian markets have now become veterans in their respective industries. Over the years, from government monopolies to family owned business
structures to the emergence of corporations’, the shareholding patterns in the Indian industrial fora have transitioned through various stages.
This research study tracks the movements in the shareholding patterns of Indian Companies spanning over a period from the 1980s up to 2015 to examine the impact of liberalization as an economic policy. The key objectives of this study are:
1. To describe the evolution of India’s listed companies’ shareholding structure.
2. To study the evolution of India’s industrial structure at the firm level as a result of
the reforms.
3. To analyze the industrial composition by ownership before and after reforms.
This study offers a captivating kaleidoscope of shareholding trends across the companies in the different industries over the years. This study is organized as follows:
Section 1: Overview of evolution in Company incorporations in India pre and post
liberalization.
Section 2: Description of trends in Industrial Structure in Non-Government Companies’
incorporations and the corresponding sectorial contributions to the GDP.
Section 3: Study of various ownership patterns in Indian Companies and the trends therein.
Section 4: Analysis of shareholding structures in listed companies (SENSEX.)
Section 5: Study of impact of foreign investments in the Indian Corporate Sector.
Section 6: Brief comparison of the shareholding patterns of business organizations as well as liberalization policies among the BRIC nations.

For instance, the attribution of positive feelings and cognitions to a stimulus leads to a positive judgment of that stimulus. We examined whether misattribution is moderated by the applicability of a distractor to the judgment question. For instance, when are people more likely to attribute to a target person the affective and cognitive experiences triggered by a kitten—when trying to judge the person's cuteness or trustworthiness? The kitten triggers experiences specifically relevant to cuteness, but people might more easily suspect the kitten's potential influence when judging cuteness rather than trustworthiness. Using the Affect Misattribution Procedure, we found that applicability increases the effect of misattribution on valenced judgments. The results emphasize the importance of specific information (rather than only general valence) in attribution and suggest that high applicability of distractors to the judgment question does not elicit effective correction.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:45:23.540015,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-21T16:21:46.542386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/citation/,ugm49,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qwbzn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/relationships/node/,qwbzn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab1edf980f2d3000e5b7fcc/,5ab1edf980f2d3000e5b7fcc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ugm49/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ugm49

In this report, we present a new pipeline architecture for integrated modeling of urban land use, travel demand, and traffic assignment. Our land use model, UrbanSim, is an open-source microsimulation platform used by metropolitan planning organizations worldwide for modeling the growth and development of cities over long (~30 year) time horizons. UrbanSim is particularly powerful as a scenario analysis tool, enabling planners to compare and contrast the impacts of different policy decisions on long term land use forecasts in a statistically rigorous way. Our travel demand model, ActivitySim, is an agent-based modeling platform that produces synthetic origin--destination travel demand data. Finally, we use a static user equilibrium traffic assignment model based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to assign vehicles to specific network paths to make trips between origins and destinations. This traffic assignment model runs in a high-performance computing environment. The resulting congested travel time data can then be fed back into UrbanSim and ActivitySim for the next model run. This technical report introduces this research area, describes this project's achievements so far in developing this integrated pipeline, and presents an upcoming research agenda.",TRUE,FALSE,abm|accessibility|activity-based modeling|agent-based modeling|graph theory|land use|microsimulation|modeling|networks|real estate|regional planning|simulation|traffic assignment|transportation|travel demand|urbansim,2018-07-02T11:45:23.308750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-21T16:20:19.665433,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/citation/,74zaw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pq9xd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/relationships/node/,pq9xd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab1c8aefb9476000c29d3cb/,5ab1c8aefb9476000c29d3cb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/74zaw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/74zaw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/74zaw

Today, proponents of randomized control trials (so-called randomistas) are among the most influential of development experts. This article examines the growth of this thought collective, analysing how uncertainty has become a central concern of development institutions. It demonstrates that transformations within the aid industry – including the influence of evidence-based policy, the economization of development, and the retreat from macro-planning – created the conditions of possibility for experimentation. Within this field, the randomistas adeptly pursued a variety of rhetorical, affective, methodological, and organizational strategies that emphasized the lack of credible knowledge within aid and the ability of experiments to rectify the situation. Importantly, they have insisted on the moral worth of experimentation; indeed, the experimental ethic has been proposed as the way to change the spirit of development. Through causal certitude, they propose to reduce human suffering. The rise of experimentation has not, however, eliminated accusations of uncertainty; rather, it has redistributed the means through which knowledge about development is considered credible.",TRUE,FALSE,aid|development|evidence|experimentation|uncertainty,2018-07-02T11:45:22.966549,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T20:15:11.412618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/citation/,xygzb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m45yu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/relationships/node/,m45yu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab1588c80f2d300105b5854/,5ab1588c80f2d300105b5854,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xygzb/,https://doi.org/10.1080/03085147.2018.1432153,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xygzb

We argue that 'topics' can be interpreted as frames, if 1) frames are operationalized as connections between concepts, 2) subject-specific data is selected, and 3) topics are adequately validated as frames, for which we suggest a practical procedure. As an empirical example, we study the global climate change debate in the media, by comparing frames used by NGO's, governments and experts in India and the USA. Our model identifies 12 framings of climate change, used in varied proportions by the different actors in the two countries. Topic modeling frames enables the usage of larger datasets and facilitates discovery of previously unnoticed framing patterns. It does not replace qualitative interpretation, but rather complements it by enabling a degree of automated classification before the interpretive stage.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|framing|media|methodology|topic modeling,2018-07-02T11:45:22.797054,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T20:14:22.744833,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Tuukka Ylä-Anttila|Veikko Eranti &amp; Anna Kukkonen,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/citation/,dgc38,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zqk4x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/relationships/node/,zqk4x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab128cc80f2d300105b2620/,5ab128cc80f2d300105b2620,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dgc38/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dgc38/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dgc38
