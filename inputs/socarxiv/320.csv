Since 1978, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has implemented successive waves of poverty alleviation policies whose effects have become the focus of an ever-increasing body of academic literature. This paper reviews this diverse but limited literature that evaluates the impact of the CPC’s poverty reduction programs through four major channels, namely fiscal investment programs, social safety nets, rural governance on the village-, county- and provincial level, and the relocation of rural populations from destitute regions. This paper aims to synthesize results and evaluate whether and how the abovementioned poverty alleviation programs have had distinct positive or negative impacts on regional development outcomes. Furthermore, I highlight contradictions in empirical findings to motivate the discussion about contextual importance when designing and implementing future poverty alleviation programs. Finally, I suggest that an exhaustive and critical appraisal of the empirical strategies used in this literature would further the development and application of more accurate and informative methodologies.",TRUE,FALSE,depressed areas|Poverty alleviation|poverty analysis|regional policy|welfare,2019-09-08T16:55:52.713613,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-08T16:55:16.280687,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/citation/,gmuav,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d734bd01e603a001831bd9f/,5d734bd01e603a001831bd9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gmuav/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gmuav/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gmuav,NA

The purpose of this study was to understand the implementation of self-directed supports for individuals with IDD. Researchers interviewed state developmental disabilities administrators in 34 of 42 states that currently operate self-directed service options and used qualitative analysis to arrive at a thematic map of the strengths and challenges currently experienced by state administrators. Common strengths identified by state administrators were increased opportunities for participant self-determination and improved relationships with support staff. Common challenges included restructuring case management relationships as well as rulemaking and enforcement. Administrators’ suggestions for the future of self-direction focused on increasing program size and streamlining services using technology.,TRUE,FALSE,implementation research|intellectual and developmental disabilities|medicaid waiver|participant-direction|qualitative research|self-direction,2019-09-06T21:16:06.525258,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-06T21:15:45.318486,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/citation/,cyf6d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d72bcee1e603a00183133d4/,5d72bcee1e603a00183133d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyf6d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cyf6d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cyf6d,https://doi.org/10.1177/1044207318790061

While the literature on victim impact from traditional types of crime like robbery or assault is well established, little of the published research examining the impact of online crime like cyber abuse. The current paper examines victim impact and self-protective behaviours following victimization from different types of cyber abuse. Using the data from a large sample of American adults (N = 1,463) we identified the factors predictive of higher victim impact and adoption of self-protective behaviours, modelling the data using a Bayesian variable selection procedure implemented via a stochastic search algorithm in AutoStat\textregistered. Our findings suggest that controlling for socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race and employment, different types of cyber abuse are important explanations of both victim impact and self-protective behaviours following cyber abuse victimization. Findings from this study contribute to both our understanding of cyber abuse as a broad crime category, the mechanism of adoption self-protective behaviours following victimization, as well as help inform policy responses to the needs of cyber abuse victims.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-06T15:22:45.612980,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-06T15:22:28.453737,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/citation/,f6whm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d71bcde01a9f9001a508635/,5d71bcde01a9f9001a508635,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6whm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6whm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6whm,NA

Using data from the National Survey of Family Growth, logistic regression models are used to estimate the association between demographic, socioeconomic, and reproductive characteristics and the probability of having an unmet need for any contraception and for modern methods.  The results show that 6.8% of the women at risk did not use any form of contraception and 12.1% did not use any modern method. Women who were black, Catholic, insured by Medicaid or uninsured, nulliparous, and who had not used contraception at their first sex had the greatest odds of having an unmet need, suggesting that specific groups are disproportionately vulnerable to unwanted pregnancy in the United States.",TRUE,FALSE,contraception|inequality|United States,2019-09-06T15:22:06.810138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-06T15:21:27.833730,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/citation/,3bh6t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7163307215100019a47d39/,5d7163307215100019a47d39,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3bh6t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3bh6t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3bh6t,NA

The patent system has come under intensive criticism in the past, and many scholars have proposed ways to improve it. Ideas for improvement include, e.g., prior-art bounties, contracting out examination and dynamic fee setting. However, many of these ideas have gone unheeded due to the cost of administering them and the rigidity of the patent system. We explore how distributed ledger technologies enable these major changes.",TRUE,FALSE,blockchain|distributed ledger|intellectual property|patent|smart contract,2019-09-06T15:21:06.719471,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-06T15:20:15.938256,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/citation/,qzmf8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d712db0536cf500188a24bb/,5d712db0536cf500188a24bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qzmf8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qzmf8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qzmf8,NA
