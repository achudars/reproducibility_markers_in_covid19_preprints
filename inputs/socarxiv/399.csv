To address this gap, we aim to identify factors that influence bystanders’ risk of being physically victimized. Methods: We observed bystander behavior from video surveillance footage of naturally occurring violence in night-time economy settings, and data was analyzed with a logistic regression model. Results: Data shows that approximately one out of six interventions results in some type of victimization, typically with a relatively low degree of severity. The bystander’s social group membership, the setting of the emergency, and the bystander’s intervention type are estimated as risk factors for victimization. Conclusions: Previous research suggests that a bystander’s social group membership with victims promotes intervention behavior.

In this paper, we evaluate a two-year field experiment in an apparel factory to analyze altered compensation systems designed to increase worker pay while supporting factory goals around productivity and profitability. Using a quasi-experimental design, with unique data on wages, hours, productivity, quality, and worker engagement, we estimate the impact of three altered compensation systems on pay, productivity, and factory profits. The compensation systems can be described as: 1) an improved productivity-based scheme, 2) a scheme that brings quality and waste reduction into the calculation; and 3) a “target wage” scheme. Overall, the treatments raised wages by 4.2-9.7% and increased productivity by 8-10% points. Management reported significant financial benefits from the experiment, including increased profits for five of six lines, and avoided costs and productivity losses due to decreased turnover. The factory workers, through focus-group interviews before, during, and after the intervention, reported improved relations with team members and managers. This study demonstrates altered factory compensation can support better factory performance and a better paid workforce, indicating a path towards advanced supply chains with improved wages.",TRUE,FALSE,apparel|compensation systems|Lean|value chains|worker wages,2019-03-11T00:14:22.258607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-11T00:13:59.755853,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/citation/,ntj3f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c82f5541d73810019bdfced/,5c82f5541d73810019bdfced,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ntj3f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ntj3f,NA

The use of public opinion as a variable in empirical research poses special challenges. In this article I suggest that the logic and methods inherent in the art of structural equation modeling provide opportunities to overcome some of these challenges. I describe this type of logic as it pertains to measurement error, context effects and endogeneity. Using General Social Survey data for the United States and taking thermostatic feedback models as an example, I demonstrate why it is important for policy scholars to attend to (a) measurement modeling and cross-level isomorphism, (b) shocks that might bias survey response patterns and (c) endogeneity implied by the theoretically reciprocal nature of opinion and policy feedback. These examples come with discussions of why scholars should pay attention to model specification so that theory and empirics are in unison and how to perform model fitting and testing to better develop theories and models of policy processes.",TRUE,FALSE,General Social Survey|Public Opinion|Social Policy|Structural Equation Modeling|Thermostatic Feedback|United States,2019-03-09T11:44:46.949777,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-09T11:44:15.849115,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/citation/,48fye,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vu3s5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/relationships/node/,vu3s5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c826f941d73810017be252a/,5c826f941d73810017be252a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/48fye/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/48fye,NA

Produced annually since 1990 in conjunction with the US Census Bureau, the IRS migration data represent 95 to 98 percent of the tax-filing universe and their dependents, making the IRS migration data one of the largest sources of migration data. However, any analysis using the IRS migration data must process at least seven legacy formats of these public data across more than 2000 data files -- a serious burden for migration scholars. 

OBJECTIVE: To produce a single, flat data file containing complete county-to-county IRS migration flow data and to make the computer code to process the migration data freely available. 

METHODS: This paper uses R to process more than 2,000 IRS migration files into a single, flat data file for use in migration research. 

CONTRIBUTION: To encourage and facilitate the use of this data, we provide a single, standardized, flat data file containing county-to-county 1-year migration flows for the period 1990-2010 (containing 163,883 dyadic county pairs resulting in 3.2 million county pair-year observations totaling over 343 million migrants) and provide the full R script to download, process, and flatten the IRS migration data.",TRUE,FALSE,data|demography|IRS|migration|R,2019-03-07T16:53:41.983582,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-07T16:51:52.902095,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/citation/,zmp4t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wgcf3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/relationships/node/,wgcf3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c81253202da7700198f70d3/,5c81253202da7700198f70d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmp4t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmp4t,https://doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2019.40.40

We do not find strong evidence for or against positive average intent-to-treat effects on household-level outcomes, including indicators of expenditure, calorie and protein intake, diet quality, egg consumption and production, as well as chicken ownership and management. Among girls between the ages of six and 60 months, we find that the program reduced stunting by 23.5 (+/- 19.4) percentage points, while also improving other height and weight outcomes. Boys are more likely to suffer from intestinal illness, which could explain differences in program impacts by gender. Using machine learning methods, we show that the poorest households enjoyed the largest impacts on diet quality and animal protein consumption, while children in the poorest households experienced the largest impacts on the probability of consuming animal source foods. Larger effects on animal source food consumption among children in relatively poor households did not translate into greater impacts on height or weight.",TRUE,FALSE,Guatemala|impact evaluation|Latin America|livestock|machine learning|randomized trial|stunting,2019-03-06T04:08:26.126112,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-06T04:07:57.868591,FALSE,NA,no,Replication files are available on the OSF project page,,no,There is no pre-registration.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/citation/,c6zg5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mg6p9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/relationships/node/,mg6p9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7eb9a2773b2d0017091405/,5c7eb9a2773b2d0017091405,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6zg5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c6zg5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c6zg5,NA

Is it beneficial to have an educational degree that is linked to only one or a small set of occupations? To answer this question, we generalize existing models of the effects of (mis)match between education and occupation on labor market outcomes. Specifically, we incorporate the structural effects of linkage strength between school and work, which vary considerably across industrialized countries. In an analysis of France, Germany, and the United States, we find that workers have higher earnings when they are in occupations that match their educational level and field of study, but the size of this earnings boost depends on the clarity and strength of the pathway between their educational credential and the labor market. The earnings premium associated with a good occupational match is larger in countries where the credential has a stronger link to the labor market, but the penalty for a mismatch is also greater in such countries. Moreover, strong linkage reduces unemployment risk. These findings add nuance to often-made arguments that countries with loosely structured educational systems have more flexible labor markets and produce better labor market outcomes for workers. An institutional environment that promotes strong school-to-work pathways appears to be an effective strategy for providing workers with secure, well-paying jobs.",TRUE,FALSE,educational attainment|Fields of study|labor markets|unemployment|vocational education,2019-03-06T04:09:21.895553,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-06T04:08:55.041067,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/citation/,df6as,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y2ta9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/relationships/node/,y2ta9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7e6d1aff4a89001c24bf0a/,5c7e6d1aff4a89001c24bf0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/df6as/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/df6as/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/df6as,NA
