This mixed-methodology research, reports survey findings with n=169 community dwelling older adults in Scotland (average age 79.5), supported with qualitative interviews to evidence the underexplored connection between food insecurity and physiological risk indicators of undernutrition (malnutrition), with psychosocial indicators of healthy ageing.  Findings are grounded in collaboration with a third sector social enterprise – Food Train, who provide food shopping and volunteer meal making for those aged 65+.  Findings revealed correlations between food insecurity and early indicators of malnutrition risk with poorer wellbeing, and social connectedness. Supported food access mitigates the negative cycle of food insecurity on mental health, via empowerment (locus of control) over one’s life. Qualitative findings suggest that risks of food insecurity may not be financial (food poverty), or attributable to health realities associated with ageing. Rather, psychosocial health and wellbeing diverge as older adults attempt to draw upon available resources, reflective of their own social capital.  Mitigators of malnutrition risk includes empowerment through social care located in the third sector, as well as social aspects of food access e.g. social eating, warranting future investigation.

Prevalence rates, however, remain inconclusive due to inconsistencies in the applied definition of sexual violence. While the development of the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) and its popular use among scholars already allowed for greater comparisons between studies, the latest revision dates back from 2006. In the meantime legal definitions have changed and other forms of sexual violence have become more prominent. This paper discusses changes made to the SES in the context of a large-scale national representative study regarding sexual violence among the Belgian population. The rationale indicated that changes to the SES may be necessary to increase its applicability in today’s society. The aim of this paper is to inform future scholars who wish to examine sexual violence and make similar changes, therefore allowing for greater comparability between studies.

We explore the relevance of this research paradigm for Inuit by examining how Inuit from Kangiqsujuaq present and discuss the major issues facing their community. We thematically code and analyze the responses of 107 Inuit to three free-response questions about the problems facing their community and the best things about their community. The data were collected as part of a questionnaire for a project focused on food security and food sharing conducted in Kangiqsujuaq, Nunavik, in 2013–2014. Few respondents mentioned issues relating to climate change among the most pressing problems facing their community. Rather, a suite of interconnected social and economic issues, particularly substance abuse and the cost of living, emerged as the main concerns of Kangiqsujuarmiut. However, the environment was a central theme in respondents’ favourite thing about their community. In light of the concerns identified by Inuit, we argue that much research on climate change makes incorrect a priori assumptions and consequently fails to capture aspects of Arctic socioecological systems that are essential for how Inuit are responding to climate change.

One consequence is researchers concurrently may have to use multiple funding sources with perhaps differing characteristics. Tracing these (co-)funding dynamics and how assorted funding mixes might influence research is important. Few approaches exist in previous literature to guide such an effort. This working paper takes initial steps by suggesting tracing approaches and undertaking exploratory fieldwork to refine them. To anchor our tracing, we propose a novel concept of the ‘funding configuration’ of ‘funding instruments’ (e.g. grants) concurrently held by a researcher at a particular time. We suggest ‘technical’ and ‘analytical’ categories to characterise these instruments, tracing who is funding research (‘type’ and ‘origin’) and for what aims (i.e. to generate ‘scholarly’ or ‘societal’ impacts). We trace selected funding dynamics in Renewable Energy Research and Food Science for researchers affiliated to Danish, Dutch and Norwegian public research organisations. We use funding acknowledgements (FAs) self-reported in papers specifically to study attributable funding configurations of researchers. These cases are filtered from a bespoke dataset of Web of Science FA metadata, covering 2009 to 2018. We characterise over 50 funding instruments and describe funding dynamics for 12 researchers, based on desk-based tracing, and gain insights from interviewing four researchers. We encounter challenges around limited public availability of funding data. Some of our tested categories to characterise funding instruments (whether funding is competitive and recurrent) prove difficult to determine while others (type and origin) are validated. Funding instruments held by researchers emerge as nuanced, with hybrid blends of ‘scholarly’ and ‘societal’ characteristics, rather than these being mutually exclusive.

A wide range of characteristics that lead to these ‘place-protective’ motives, including conservatism and long-term residence in an area, strongly predict opposition to housebuilding. This contrasts with theories emphasising homeowners’ price anxiety as the main driver. A conjoint experiment demonstrates that opposition to housebuilding can be reduced by designing new developments that preserve and protect existing communities, such as providing new public services alongside them. Doing so increases the coalition for housebuilding by raising the support of groups most opposed to housebuilding, without lowering the support of others. This paper also adds a comparative focus to the politics of housebuilding, discussing institutional features that increase the prominence of place-protective motives.",TRUE,FALSE,Housebuilding|Housing|NIMBY,2020-10-02T07:23:02.794088,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-02T07:22:09.165237,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Tom O'Grady,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/citation/,d6pzy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7370d268d85003b88a45e5/,5f7370d268d85003b88a45e5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6pzy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d6pzy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d6pzy,NA

We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the proceedings from the 1st International Conference for Quantitative Ethnography in order to compare methodological decisions researchers made. Data was extracted with a standardized template and coded deductively by a team of researchers. Our findings show that although many QE terms and processes (e.g. concerning coding and segmentation) were employed, they were often not reported explicitly or defined.

Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to have successfully capitalized on this national crisis to boost support for himself in the short term. Prime Minister However, as discussed below, even if the growing death toll from the outbreak was reversed, there were other countries whose successes did not translate into increased support for the government, one of which was Japan.
This study analyzes the surge in support for the prime minister during the first wave of the coronavirus epidemic in Israel within the framework of the rally effect. Israel was chosen as a case study for two reasons. First, the country was repeatedly polled during the first wave of infection. Second, a special policy that met the requirements for natural experimentation—a strict compartmentalized blockade limited to certain areas—had been in place for a while. These two conditions mean that a study of Israel during the first wave of the epidemic will allow us to make discoveries about the conditions under which a society supports its political leaders in the face of a national crisis.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|Israel|lockdown|natural experiment|rally effects,2020-10-02T07:17:22.951446,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-02T07:15:57.097119,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://www.law.ryukoku.ac.jp/~oshiro/data/covid19/covid_rally_firtst_wave.dta|http://www.law.ryukoku.ac.jp/~oshiro/data/covid19/svy_ols_code.do,not_applicable,,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Shingo Hamanaka,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/citation/,vxutw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7337ea46080903f31b4b19/,5f7337ea46080903f31b4b19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vxutw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vxutw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vxutw,NA
