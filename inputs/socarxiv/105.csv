This paper studies the effect of changes in the minimum wage on spatial equilibriums in local labor markets. Using residence and workplace data for the United States, I analyze how commuting, residence, and employment locations change across city and state borders if the minimum wage changes on one side of the border. I find that areas in which the minimum wage increases receive fewer low-wage commuters. A 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces the inflow of low-wage commuters by about 2.5 percent. Rises in the minimum wage are also associated with employment relocation across borders toward areas that did not witness an increase in the minimum wage. I formulate a spatial equilibrium gravity model to explain the distribution of workers between low- and high-minimum wage areas. I calculate counterfactual equilibriums with a higher minimum wage for U.S. counties with cities considering an increase, highlighting the role of commuting and migration responses. About two-fifths of the counties considering increases would receive fewer low-wage commuters. Employment relocation away from high-minimum wage areas drives the commuting losses.",TRUE,FALSE,Commuting|Migration|Minimum Wage|Spatial Equilibrium,2021-01-15T08:31:02.471361,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-15T08:30:48.452185,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/|https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0047272719300052-mmc1.pdf|https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs|https://www.census.gov/topics/population.html|https://www.bls.gov/lau/|https://www.bls.gov/cew/|https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113026/version/V1/view|https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/how-much-would-a-state-earned-income-tax-credit-cost-in-fiscal-year|https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/|https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp|https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2010.html|https://qwiexplorer.ces.census.gov/static/explore.html,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/citation/,fpx9e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6000dc8986541a05da14b649/,6000dc8986541a05da14b649,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fpx9e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fpx9e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fpx9e,NA

It is often argued that diversity depletes the social capital of trust and cooperation. We argue there is no compelling theoretical reason for supposing that trust and cooperation will move together in response to diversity; and we provide new causal evidence that they do not. While diversity undermines trust, we find that people in more diverse societies are, surprisingly, better able to cooperate in both new aggregate and individual level observational data and in laboratory experiments. These results caution against the suggestion that diversity creates trade-offs for society: e.g. between innovativeness and solidarity or between freedom of movement and welfare state generosity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-14T23:07:45.627225,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T23:00:29.639217,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,Marco Giani|Shaun Hargreaves Heap|Dimitrios Minos,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/citation/,c5m2j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6000bd5b86541a05d514a7e6/,6000bd5b86541a05d514a7e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c5m2j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c5m2j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c5m2j,NA

Zero deforestation can be implemented using the High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA), a tool that distinguishes forests from degraded land which can be developed. In highly forested countries like Gabon, zero deforestation may conflict with national economic goals involving palm oil and other agricultural commodities. We investigated perspectives of stakeholders in Gabon about zero deforestation and the HCSA using Critical Systems Heuristics, a systems thinking methodology. In 25 interviews with government, NGOs, companies, and research institutions, and two focus groups with rural communities, we identified three contrasting perspectives on forest conservation and agro-industrial development: international, national, and local. Zero deforestation represents an international perspective that marginalises issues from a national perspective. This may produce unintended consequences that undermine the legitimacy of zero deforestation, including conversion of Gabon’s savannahs and disincentives for sustainable business development. From a local perspective, zero deforestation is embedded in an agro-industrial vision that marginalises value judgments concerning forests and traditional livelihoods. Gabon’s National Land Use Plan could help reconcile the three perspectives but requires recognition by international standards. Adapting the HCSA should also be considered. Research is required to ensure proposed institutional arrangements deliver equitable multi-stakeholder participation in land-use planning. Gabon’s case shows the applicability of zero deforestation to all highly forested countries cannot be assumed. Improved international understanding of national contexts, and flexibility in applying “zero deforestation”, is important for designing effective and equitable international standards for sustainable agricultural production.",TRUE,FALSE,commodities|conservation|critical systems heuristics|deforestation|equity|gabon|palm oil|Supply chains|sustainable business|systems thinking|zero deforestation,2021-01-14T17:36:05.510412,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T17:28:55.249233,TRUE,"J.L.W. received in-kind research support from Olam International (fieldwork advice, accommodation, workspace and road travel in Gabon) and The Nature Conservancy (fieldwork advice, accommodation and workspace).

This implies that political organization and state structures may be viewed as different ways of handling uncertainty, each trading off freedom and equality in a slightly different manner, but each with an equivalent, and theoretically symmetric, balance between the two. I will argue that uncertainty in an intelligent agent arises from one of three primary sources. First, the agent’s logical, objective, mental model of the environment may be noisy. Second, subjective, affective appraisals, of other individuals, their behaviours, and their intentions may present substantial randomness. Finally, the relationship between the objective, real, external world, to the subjective, internal world of the agent may be blurry. As I will show, in any basic two-level Bayesian model of reasoning, these same three sources of uncertainty naturally arise as three learnable parameters. These three parameters govern the operation of the model, but must be traded-off against each other. Furthermore, I will give these three dimensions of uncertainty some theoretical validity, by showing how they pervasively occur across a wide swatch of literatures as three dimensions of political freedom and equality. The relationship between the parameters and the freedoms is a key step in gaining a better understanding of political movements. For example, I discuss how the transition from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity during the industrial revolution in the 19th century, as described by Durkheim, is in fact a shift in the management of uncertainty to one focused on immediate meanings to one focused on trust. Further, such shifts may be purposefully initiated by politically interested groups, by spreading new narratives or introducing new policy. Viewed as uncertainty management, any shifts so induced should be carefully evaluated in terms of what freedoms it compromises, with smoother transitions assured for shifts that remain in a position of equilibrium with respect to freedom and equality.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian modeling|Durkheim|equality|freedom|free energy|hierarchical modeling|mechanical solidarity|organic solidarity|uncertainty|variational methods,2021-01-14T17:36:43.130486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T17:30:28.165667,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Jesse Hoey,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/citation/,f463y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ku34d/,ku34d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600041bf86541a058f14ae68/,600041bf86541a058f14ae68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f463y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f463y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f463y,NA

In Saudi Arabia, there is a widely held perception that it is possible for the EFL learners to attain the high levels of proficiency in writing reading and listening, but they cannot speak English as compared to their peers from around the globe. This is quite concerning as these students have selective and compulsory English courses that run through their almost ten years of compulsory school education. The challenges to speaking by these students had formerly been addressed by sorting out the challenges of deficiencies in teacher development and teacher education, learners’ autonomy lack of material and technology in the EFL classes and anxiety in learning a foreign language. The purpose is to seek answers to the challenges of speaking English from the Saudi speaking EFL students themselves. In order to do that a sample of 66 students who have enrolled in year one of intensive preparatory English class will be used. A mixed method research design will be used in the triangulation of the findings for higher validity.

To achieve the study goals, a mixed method was used, content analysis and a compiling quantitative data in which the corpus of the English textbook was analyzed; frequencies and percentages of gender appearances and activities were also calculated. The major findings of the study were as follows: First, women were underrepresented in terms of appearance. Second, males were dominant of the reading passages and dialogues topics. Third, there is an overall higher tendency for females to be referenced in sentences before males. forth, males were presented in a wider range and overall a higher level of employment and enjoyed a wider range of spare time and leisure activities than females. Fifth, however, the distribution of household responsibilities was equal between females and males and female activities were not restricted to passive indoor activities.

Therefore, learners are less motivated to depend on their listening comprehension as a tool to help them in the process of language learning. Social media, especially YouTube and Snapchat, can be effectively used as a pedagogical tool to enhance the listening skills of EFL learners, compared with other traditional audio recording tools. The objective of this research is to investigate the role of social media (YouTube and snapchat) as a method of teaching, in order to enhance EFL Saudi learners' listening comprehension skills. The primary goal of this study is to know whether social media is capable of developing EFL listening comprehension skills, and gaining the deeper understanding of the presented materials. In addition, using these tools makes them familiar with the target language culture and it's native speakers. In order to achieve this objective; the researcher used a mixed method to ensure the research validity: a questionnaire and a post-test.The participants of the study were 50 female students studying in English Language Centre at Taif University. They were randomly selected and they divided into two groups: the experiment group consisted of 20 female students and the control group consisted of 30 female students. The experiment group was instructed using (YouTube and Snapchat) as the control group using traditional audio method. Then there is a post-test is given to both groups to measure their listening comprehension performance. The findings of the study showed that using social media (YouTube and Snapchat) can enhance the listening skill of Saudi EFL leaners. The researcher recommends conducting more studies on other samples from different studies, age levels and from different environments like the schools or training institutes.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL|listening comprehension skills|Snapchat|social media|YouTube,2021-01-14T04:33:02.714026,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:31:33.386205,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/citation/,tpfxk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffc4f7ba010904fa894411/,5fffc4f7ba010904fa894411,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpfxk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tpfxk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tpfxk,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.268

The study also provided functional analysis of the solutions occasionally chosen by professional Netflix subtitlers to overcome those cultural problems. The study aimed at showing whether the strategies frequently chosen by the subtitler to deal with particular problematic cultural features were equally successful in achieving functional adequacy in the TT. The researcher integrated Vermeer’s functionally based Skopos theory into Newmark's translation procedures to provide a descriptive functional analysis of 44 examples taken from the American series, Thirteen Reasons Why. The content-analysis led to two main findings. The first was related to the most frequent strategies used to render the intended skopos (functions) of the source cultural features; paraphrase being the highest in use since it was used 18 times out of 44. The second finding was that the rate of frequency of strategies chosen correlated strictly with the rate of functional adequacy of these strategies. Paraphrase achieved its intended functions adequately in 15 out of 18 examples",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Problems|subtitling audiovisual texts|Target language Vermeer’s Skopos Theory|TV series,2021-01-14T04:33:26.335670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14T04:31:51.964112,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/citation/,27hrf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffc435ba010904fa89433d/,5fffc435ba010904fa89433d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27hrf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/27hrf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/27hrf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.266
