Prevalence and criminal career correlates among a sample of juvenile detainees in Australia,"For more than 60 years, scholars have often likened chronic and persistent offending to ‘living a criminal way of life’, yet these evocative motifs have not received much empirical scrutiny. In particular, the so-called criminal lifestyle is often conceptualised as something the chronic young offender opts into as an alternative to other pro-social pathways. Whereas for older offenders, it is something into which they find themselves trapped an unable to escape. The idea that crime  is a chosen ‘way of life’ among chronic young offenders has not yet received sufficient empirical scrutiny. In this study, we use archival data of nationally representative cohort (n=373) of  serious young offenders from Australia who were each asked whether crime was their ‘way of life’. From this, we estimate its prevalence and criminal-career correlates, finding that one in three strongly identify with crime as their way of life. Self-identification is also found to be strongly correlated with Indigenous status even after controlling for different features of the juvenile criminal career. In all, our data paint a vivid portrait of a criminal identity that, for the young offender, likely signals a perceived inevitability that evolves in the context of  structurally and culturally conditioned opportunities. Understanding this phenomenon among youthful offenders is important if we are to be successful in our attempts to curtail criminal continuity through desistance informed interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,criminal career|identity|juvenile crime|youth crime|youth offending,2020-04-19T05:04:09.748417,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:33:06.964400,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Jason Payne,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/citation/,qxrze,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9655abf135350471d585d6/,5e9655abf135350471d585d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxrze/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qxrze/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004865820960193,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qxrze

Articles trying to define DH have become something of a genre—however, more often than not the conclusions boil down to “DH is undefinable” or even “DH must not be defined.”  A question that is rarely addressed, though, is *why* DH is supposedly undefinable.  In this paper we argue that this is not because it would be, for example, particularly difficult to come up with a definition or because unlike most other fields, DH would not benefit from delimiting its domain, but rather because the majority of researchers that self-identify as “DH scholars” are actively opposing a definition.  This is due to the fact that they understand DH as “contemporary humanities,” i.e., humanities using contemporary tools, not a new discipline.  While legitimate, this view is irreconcilable with the understanding of DH as the development and application of a new—computational—methodology in the humanities.  We therefore come to the conclusion that there is ultimately no way around clearly delimiting these two opposing views; we propose to use the term “computational humanities” to refer to the latter field, and we present a concise definition.",TRUE,FALSE,academic disciplines|computational humanities|definition|digital humanities|formal models|terminology,2020-04-15T05:02:30.137223,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T20:17:14.089787,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/citation/,d2kb6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e961713f13535044fd5354c/,5e961713f13535044fd5354c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2kb6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d2kb6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d2kb6

It is addressed to the general public and focuses on questions related to the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) ecosystem. It does not present new research findings. Instead, it provides a reading of current real-world developments using economic reasoning and relying on existing economic research.

The first part of the report explains the root causes for a general underinvestment in Research and Development (R&amp;D), with a particular focus on vaccines. These causes include an insufficient demand for vaccines in normal times and the very characteristics of R&amp;D. Governments can intervene to mitigate these problems, but government intervention comes with its own set of issues. We discuss three of them, namely free riding, setting research priorities, and acting on scientific knowledge.

The second part discusses several aspects related to current STI policy reactions. First, we observe a sizable shift of funds towards research on SARS-CoV-2. Aren’t we wasting money by allocating so much of it on one single scientific problem? Using the concept of the ‘elasticity of science,’ we argue that we are far from a situation where additional funding would represent a waste of money.

Second, we also observe an unprecedented level of cooperation among researchers but also an intense competition to find therapeutic solutions and vaccines. We seek to make sense of this apparent antonymy, highlighting how both cooperative and competitive forces might accelerate research.

Third, we focus on one policy tool, namely patents, and we discuss whether the existence of patents hampers the search for a solution. We argue that it might, but we provide ways in which patents can be beneficial. They can accelerate research (such as through patent pools) or ensure greater access to innovations (such as with compulsory licensing).

Fourth, we notice that the whole STI ecosystem has been rapidly refocusing on SARS-CoV-2 in a way similar to mission-oriented R&amp;D (MOR) programs such as the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. We highlight the fundamental differences between MOR and the present situation. Today’s response is characterized by a proliferation of a wide range of innovative solutions offered by a complex set of institutions and actors with great intellectual freedom and decentralized competition.
The third part of the report assesses some potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We firstly discuss its impact on R&amp;D investment. We explain how innovation might be negatively affected by a prolonged economic downturn and highlight the crucial role of stimulus packages in confronting the recession. We also address the influence of the crisis on ICT, arguing that it has been a formidable catalyst for ICT adoption. Next, we focus on clean technologies, another major societal challenge besides the pandemic. There are strong reasons for why cleantech investment may suffer. However, the crisis also offers significant opportunities to accelerate the green transition. Finally, we focus on open science, in particular on open access and open data. The current crisis could be a catalyst for the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Practices.

The last part of the report offers some concluding thoughts. The STI policy response cannot be limited to the urgent need for ‘technological fixes.’ A second line of response involves the production of new knowledge to prevent outbreaks (ex-ante) or mitigate their effects (ex-post). Furthermore, the current crisis is a reminder that all branches of science matter. The pandemic has many facets, and a significant number of scientific disciplines can contribute to dealing with it. We conclude with a forward-looking note, arguing that the most substantial impact of the pandemic may lie outside of the public health realm or the science system. It offers a unique opportunity to adapt the set of rules that govern our society.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|economics|innovation|policy,2020-04-15T05:02:26.806027,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T20:14:31.775811,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/citation/,b5zae,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e960a31f13535044ed525f2/,5e960a31f13535044ed525f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5zae/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b5zae/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b5zae

This fact introduced a serious barrier between them.  This is to the extent that they could not mingle or relate cordially.  Thus, their relationship was like the one that exists between lepers and the healthy.  Hence, Gentiles were excluded from membership of Israel, aliens with no part  in the covenants of the fatherhood.  Christ is the unifying force between the circumcised  and the uncircumcised. With his blood, he absolved the Gentiles of all that used to distance them and made the circumcised to know that he is the end of the Law (Rom 10:4).  Thus, through his blood he destroyed the hostility that used to be between them. Vv 19-22 expresses the value of this newly founded unity in Christ.  Despite the above, there is still divisions in the Church today, hence, absence of peace in Christendom.  This article therefore answers why it is so.  It aims at showing that rivalry that exists among believers, exposes their insincerity and hypocrisy.  It argues that if all Christians understand the mind of Christ in destroying the barrier that existed between nations (Gentiles and Jews), then the whole Christendom would have remained peaceful and truly under one head.

The essence of the picture painted in the arguments against ‘oriental states’ is a despotic and extractive one that hinders commercial activities. This paper tries to address this debate through looking at the nature and role of Mughal the administrative machinery and challenge image of despotic hegemony. In order to address the issue of commensurability of sources, the present author has only used European accounts and correspondences produced by the English East India Company and the Dutch VOC. The paper argues that the Eurocentric perspective essentially paints an ahistorical picture of the Mughal state by investigating European responses to the deaths of important Mughal emperors (Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb) and the economic consequences following it. Additionally, this paper also provides evidence of a strong role of bankers in the internal commercial system further undermining the image of the extractive state and supporting the ‘Great Firm theory’ of Karen Leonard. In conclusion, it is argued that the European-exceptionalism theory is fundamentally based on an orientalist imagination of South Asia and essentially suffers from the pitfalls of the ‘historiography of decline’ that plague the history of other ‘Asian’ empires such as the Qing and the Ottomans. Eighteenth century South Asia shows considerable similarities with early modern Europe and its commercial viability and agility does not appear to be dependent on the central government or the abilities of the emperor.",TRUE,FALSE,East India Company|Economic History|Great Divergence|Mughal,2020-04-15T05:02:41.568598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14T16:34:22.852066,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/citation/,7vq6u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9547ecf1353503ffd5cb38/,5e9547ecf1353503ffd5cb38,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vq6u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7vq6u/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7vq6u

There are several studies in the literature reporting different aspects of STEM into a PjBL pedagogy. However, the effect of implementing STEM PjBL in terms of improving students’ skills in self-efficacy levels in physics mechanics at high school level has not been demonstrated as expected in the previous literature. This study followed a quasi-experimental research method. Bandura’s social cognitive theory is used to assess and compare the effect of STEM PjBL with conventional teaching method on students’ self-efficacy level in learning physics among over 100 high school students. The result illustrated that STEM PjBL improve students’ self-efficacy to solve physics problem.
