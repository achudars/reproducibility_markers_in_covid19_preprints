Despite being a considerably large group, the youth has been commonly underrepresented in decision-making in the public and private sectors. To combat this situation, the UN launched the Youth 2030 strategy in 2018 thereby recognizing the need to empower the youth to reach their full potential (Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy). In this contribution, we provide a brief description of some of the recent transnational youth networks (TYNs) and their features in order to discuss the role of such networks to empower the youth. We propose here that such networks constitute a novel and powerful form of public diplomacy (PD) because of their experiential educational aspects that they develop in their members. Moreover, these networks also offer a rather unique opportunity of building interpersonal relationships among global prominent individuals thereby influencing the international agenda. We further discuss how such networks can advance substantially the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda (Sustainable Development Goals).",TRUE,FALSE,diplomacy|education|public diplomacy|sustainable development goals|transnational youth networks|youth,2020-03-09T03:21:00.719591,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-09T03:20:40.589716,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/citation/,8247s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6556aa0f987d0337496846/,5e6556aa0f987d0337496846,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8247s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8247s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8247s,NA

These were associated with the Millennium Development Goals and the Education for All movements. They have provided a global policy and regulatory environment for the directions and nature of interventions towards the achievement of significant improvement access to and quality of primary education. Other considerable policy documents have identified the need for ICT reform within the education sector and these have resulted in more prioritizing from regions, schools and teachers regarding the incorporation of ICT into the education system. This study purpose is to evaluate the Level of ICT competencies towards teaching strategy of SHS teachers in ACES Polytechnic College. A survey questionnaire was distributed to a total of fifteen (15) teachers served as respondents. The instrument consists of three parts; the first part is composed of the demographic profile of the teachers and the second part focused on the ICT Competencies, and the third part is the teaching strategy of the teacher. The research method used in this study was a descriptive correlational method.

Results showed that most of the teachers have basic knowledge of ICT and needs improvement. More training is at this moment required to the teachers for them to integrate ICT in teaching and other related task assigned to them to uplift and enhance the quality of education of the said college.

We introduce the concept of tacit coalitions, which pertains to strategic and informal coalition behavior between civil war actors.

It provides novel insights to the way synergies within potential coalitions affect this trade-off.

In general, arguments regarding a given candidate’s electability often claim that they would affect the general election by changing the behavior of a certain subset of eligible voters. For example, is it more important electorally that a candidate drives turnout or swing voting? As lay consumers of political opinion, we were having difficulty weighing these claims from a strategic standpoint.
Although candidate electability is a nebulous term that might be interpreted in various ways, one interpretation of the term is a population-based causal question: what would the effect of the Democratic nominee be on the presidential election result? Population-based causal questions are commonly studied in epidemiology. To aid interpretation of electability arguments, we frame the question through a counterfactual model used in epidemiology.
Specifically, we define the causal effect by characterizing the population of eligible voters into nine counterfactual response types. The definition clarifies our ability to interpret arguments regarding the electability of the candidates. For example, the causal effect can be subdivided into three parts: the effect of the nominee on 1) Democratic turnout, 2) Republican turnout, and 3) swing voting. We show using notation that the third part has twice the weight as the other two.
The definition follows intuition. However, we hope its formalization using counterfactual response types may foster inter-disciplinary communication.",TRUE,FALSE,causality|counterfactual model|epidemiology|political science,2020-03-09T03:12:42.419984,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-09T03:12:21.229989,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/citation/,6qzb3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e62b33da096450238051855/,5e62b33da096450238051855,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qzb3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qzb3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qzb3,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.05.002

However, there is currently no standardized method for quantifying cumulative vaccination maintenance, and no simple way to explore predictors of adherence to vaccination schedules. We therefore sought to 1) develop a Vaccination Maintenance Score (VMS) and 2) apply this score to determine the predictors of vaccination behavior among infants in western Kenya (n=245).

Methods: Women in western Kenya were enrolled during pregnancy and surveyed repeatedly through one year postpartum. Data were collected on a range of sociodemographic and health indicators and vaccinations. For each infant, we analyzed receipt of 11 vaccines recommended by the Kenyan Ministry of Health. We operationalized VMS as the total number of vaccines received on schedule. Vaccines that were not received or received off-schedule were scored 0. VMS was modeled using multivariable tobit regression models.

Results: We found that 85.7% of infants were fully immunized, but only 42.4% had optimal VMS, i.e. scored 11. The median(IQR) VMS was 10(3). In multivariable regression, each one-point increase in maternal quality of life score (range: 0-32) was associated with a 0.22-point increase in VMS; each additional child in the household was associated with a 0.34-point increase in VMS; and initiating breastfeeding at birth was associated a 2.01-point increase in VMS.

Conclusions: Coverage of the recommended vaccinations (85.7%) was nearly twice as high as the cumulative timely receipt (42.4%). The VMS satisfies a need for a location-specific but easily adaptable metric of vaccination adherence behavior. It can be used to complement traditional methods of vaccination coverage and timeliness to better understand underlying behaviors that influence vaccination events, and thereby inform interventions to improve vaccination rates and decrease the burden of vaccine-preventable disease.",TRUE,FALSE,Kenya|sub-Saharan Africa|vaccination adherence|vaccination coverage|vaccination maintenance|vaccination timeliness,2020-03-08T08:24:31.549284,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-08T08:24:06.108529,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/citation/,4s76n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/49jne/,49jne,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6282aaa09645020f0519e6/,5e6282aaa09645020f0519e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4s76n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4s76n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4s76n,NA
