It presents both quantitative survey and qualitative interview data collected July–August 2016 and July–August 2017. The results are situated within a poststructuralist, postcolonial theoretical framework that critically evaluates the colonial history of the island and its ideological effects on language use, as well as highlighting the diversity of opinions found on the island. Because of this framework, the dissertation does not aim to construct a monolithic narrative of language attitudes on Pohnpei, but rather seeks diversity wherever possible. To carry out these goals, the dissertation adapts quantitative methods (multidimensional scaling, cluster analyses, correspondence analysis, and poststratified Bayesian generalized hierarchical modeling) and combines them with critical theoretical tools such as sociolinguistic scale and translanguaging. The results showed two main different ideological groups both in terms of language use and language attitude patterns. Both groups highly value Pohnpeian, English, and other local languages generally. However, the first group values English over Pohnpeian and other local languages. They in general only use Pohnpeian to connect with Pohnpeians and in situations related to the soupeidi system, but use English for most other situations including education, work, media, and government. This group’s language use patterns with scale-based language ideologies, where local levels of scale (such as family and kousapw) are highly multilingual, but become increasingly monolingual as scale increases toward the translocal level. The other group, conversely, finds Pohnpeian to be the most important language for them overall and tend to find Pohnpeian to be the most important language in every domain. The results of the dissertation indicate a disconnect between the current mostly monolingual English-focused educational practices among both private and public schools on Pohnpei and the desire of the research participants for greater use of Pohnpeian and other local languages. The current educational system likewise devalues the symbolic resources of its students, which has perpetuated negative ideologies about local languages. These ideologies adversely affect both the students and the linguistic future of local languages including Pohnpeian.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian models|critical discourse analysis|critical theory|educational policy|endangered language|English language|Federated States of Micronesia|global Englishes|globalization|heteroglossia|language attitudes|language change|Micronesia|Pohnpei|Pohnpeian language|postcolonialism|poststructuralism|quantitative methods|scale|sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic scale|surveys|translanguaging,2018-07-02T11:54:48.359657,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-07T17:31:37.983829,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/citation/,xf5gu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ewdfv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/relationships/node/,ewdfv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b18797cec24e20013b38d4e/,5b18797cec24e20013b38d4e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xf5gu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xf5gu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xf5gu,NA

In the last five decades, stemming partially from Binford’s research on the topic, the idea of settlement patterns is based on site typology, including the traditional residential and logistic concepts. Both models of land use and exploitation are certainly marked by the notion of short-term occupation. This concept, used freely by many archaeologists, tends to rely on two main ideas: an occupation lasted a short span of time and resulted in a limited amount of material culture. Our aim, based on our results from various archaeological case studies dated to the Upper Paleolithic of Portugal, is to show that neither idea is necessarily correct: e.g. there may be short-term occupations with the production of large amounts of artifacts, such as lithic workshops; there might be very small collections, such as lithic caches, resulting from short occupations but with very long uses of the site; and most times, both are hardly differentiated within complex palimpsests. Our study shows that the common use of lithic volumetric density and retouch frequency is not always sufficient to differentiate between short and long-term occupations. Also, there are other variables that are more sensitive to indicate the duration of occupation of an archaeological context that should be used in the identification of time length.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Paleolithic|Settlement patterns|Stone tools|Western Europe,2018-07-02T11:54:47.852667,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-06T21:58:35.111860,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/citation/,3wgsa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j39su/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/relationships/node/,j39su,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b183a6918b15a000c0ccd91/,5b183a6918b15a000c0ccd91,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wgsa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3wgsa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3wgsa,NA

Using local level housing data from Zillow matched to property tax data from 1998 to 2012, two questions are examined. First, the elasticity of property tax revenue with respect to house values is estimated. Second, the timing of this elasticity is determined. The analysis rules out that local policymakers capture the entire increase of house value in property tax revenues but unable to rule out that increases in house values are completely offset by changes in effective property tax rates. Decreases in values have an elasticity between 0.3 and 0.4 and take three years for changes in values to impact property tax revenues. While property tax collections declined, local policymakers adjusted effective millage rates such that revenues did not decline as much as home values.",TRUE,FALSE,Distributed Lag Model|House Prices|Property Tax|Tax Base Elasticity,2018-07-02T11:54:47.820132,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-06T21:57:47.139892,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/citation/,fam2d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dq2va/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/relationships/node/,dq2va,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b183247f37a71000e3ec903/,5b183247f37a71000e3ec903,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fam2d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fam2d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fam2d,https://doi.org/10.1111/grow.12261

regulating ethnic conflicts. Since there are successful as well as failed cases,
the ongoing debate about a general conflict-solving potential is not a very
fruitful one. The article turns towards the analysis of various factors affecting
the success and failure of conflict regulating autonomies. It is argued that
autonomy consolidation requires specific conditions which support the
process of mutual recognition between ethnic groups. Two causal models are
developed and tested on a global data set on all conflict regulating
autonomies using a two-step Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). It is
found that a combination of low horizontal inequalities, a high scope of
autonomy, inclusive institutions and international support lead to autonomy
success whereas persistent inequalities, a low scope of transferred
competencies and exclusive institutions result in a return to violent strategies.
One important implication of these findings is that favorable conditions for
post-conflict institutional engineering can, at least to some extent, be created.",TRUE,FALSE,Conflict Regulation|Ethnic Conflict;|Institutional Engineering;|QCA|Social Identity Theory|Territorial Autonomy;,2018-07-02T11:54:46.863066,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-06T21:57:20.313060,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/citation/,b6yxf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b179813eca4a80012bdd86c/,5b179813eca4a80012bdd86c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6yxf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b6yxf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b6yxf,NA

These models are commonly defined as planar, meaning they can be represented in two dimensions without any underpasses or overpasses. However, real-world urban street networks exist in three-dimensional space and frequently feature grade separation such as bridges and tunnels: planar simplifications can be useful but they also impact the results of real-world street network analysis. This study measures the nonplanarity of drivable and walkable street networks in the centers of 50 cities worldwide, then examines the variation of nonplanarity across a single city.

This study analyses the challenges posed by high-end technology, particular the management of terminological data, in relation to the notion of equivalence. The author argues that recent translation technology is in dialectic with current developments in translation theory, approaches which displace the notion of meaning in translation away from the idea of equivalence. In addition, the paper suggests that if the concept of equivalence is to have any relevance in translation theory and practice today, a more encompassing approach needs to be embraced, one which considers a diversity of factors, both internal and external to language.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:54:44.759242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-05T13:19:09.899188,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/citation/,fbh7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vr2ag/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/relationships/node/,vr2ag,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b16050da291c4000e3a204e/,5b16050da291c4000e3a204e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbh7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fbh7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fbh7y,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.16

Phillips, the Kittitian-British author, interweaves a variety of narrative voices of both black and white characters in an attempt to provide a thorough scrutiny and a deep diagnosis of a traumatic past that contains the underlining fundaments of present racial issues and identity dilemmas that black communities suffer from in both the United States and Britain. This study is primarily focused on deconstructing and reconstructing Phillips’s portrayal of what he calls “the shameful intercourse” between the slave trader and the African father. The aim of this analysis is to uncover the author’s polyphonic strategy that equally voices both the “white” and the “black”, “the oppressor” and “the oppressed”. This rather experimental study allows us to understand how polyphony is used to serve reconciliation and healing.",TRUE,FALSE,diaspora|healing|polyphony|slavery|trauma,2018-07-02T11:54:44.727687,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-07T20:32:27.051900,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/citation/,x8za4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bh6dc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/relationships/node/,bh6dc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b160418eca4a80011bcb877/,5b160418eca4a80011bcb877,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x8za4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x8za4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x8za4,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.15
