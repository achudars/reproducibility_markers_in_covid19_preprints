Assessing two decades of German reforms,"Women-friendly policies may have perverse effects on the wages of employed women and mothers in particular. Yet few have addressed the causal impact of such policies and the mechanisms they might trigger at the individual level to produce such wage responses. We assess if and how two decades of reforms of parental leave schemes in Germany have shaped changes in the motherhood wage penalty over time. We compare two sweeps of reforms inspired by opposite principles, one allowing for longer periods out of paid work, the other prompting quicker re-entry in the labour market. We deploy panel data (G-SOEP 1985-2014) and a within-person difference-in-differences design. 
Motherhood wage penalties were found to be harsher than previously assessed in the 1990s. As parental leave reform triggered longer time spent on leave coupled with better tenure accumulation, wage losses for mothers remained stable in this first period. Conversely, we can no longer detect motherhood wage penalties for women affected by the later reform. Shorter career breaks and increased work hours may have benefited new mothers in the late 2000s, leading to a substantial improvement in their wage prospects.",TRUE,FALSE,gender inequality|Germany|labour market|motherhood wage penalty|panel data|parental leave,2018-12-14T20:18:21.713463,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-14T19:18:57.753787,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Gabriele Mari and Giorgio Cutuli,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/citation/,f2nrc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5tbzc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/relationships/node/,5tbzc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c13eaaa615b34001a0d2961/,5c13eaaa615b34001a0d2961,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2nrc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f2nrc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f2nrc

Since the global financial crisis, however, the European Union has become a key challenger to the OECD. This chapter explores the evolution of policy networks in and around EU tax policy. I discuss how tax networks have moved from an ‘embryonic’ expert setting to a highly heterogeneous, contested and unstable setting, with broad public and political involvement. In the context of the crisis, the salience of international tax policy has exploded, and the EU tax policy system has proved highly adaptive in adjusting to this unprecedented attention. This new EU setting has successfully produced radical policy agendas and outputs in direct competition with the OECD.

Despite this, and even after one century of being identified there is still no consensus on how to define, analyze or interpret these tools. In western Iberia, there is a clear lack of comprehensive studies regarding this type of artifacts at a regional scale. In this paper, we present a first techno-morphological analysis of a sample of scaled pieces from the Upper Paleolithic site of Vale Boi. Our first aim was to build upon existing analytical models in order to identify function and possible reduction strategies for these artifacts. Our second goal was to critically evaluate the role of these artifacts within western Iberia’s Upper Paleolithic. Our results showed that functional identification of scaled pieces is still not clear. By comparing our data with other author’s we found that current models could not be applied to the archaeological record, as the attribute variability is too high. Furthermore, in this region, we found that higher frequencies of bipolar technology can be found related to residential sites due to both functional and cultural patterns. While we still cannot define a specific function for these artifacts (intermediate pieces or wedges for working hard raw materials or cores for the extraction of chips and small bladelets), it is clear that they had a major role in the variability and intensification of resource exploitation during the Upper Paleolithic in western Iberia.",TRUE,FALSE,Bipolar technology|Stone tools|Upper Paleolithic|Western Europe,2018-12-14T10:46:47.909273,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-14T10:46:02.890908,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/citation/,43e2y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wpxgh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/relationships/node/,wpxgh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c12f64a2dba3b00173f0194/,5c12f64a2dba3b00173f0194,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/43e2y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/43e2y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/43e2y

However, analysis of this kind of data is complex and not always well-understood by investigators. For example, rose diagrams are commonly used to display orientation data. While rose diagrams are a useful and intuitive way of visualizing the data, they are not on their own sufficient except in cases where preferential orientation is very evident. Class frequency, rather than the square root of class frequency, is commonly used to interpret the results. This can give a misleading impression of preferential orientation, when in fact observed patterns do not deviate significantly from random. Conversely, data may deviate significantly from random but this may not be clear from the diagram. At the same time, classic tests like the chi-square test are not appropriate for the display of circular data and alternative approaches are needed. This paper discusses the history of the use of rose diagrams to display orientation data, briefly reviews the archaeological literature in this regard, and discusses key problems and limitations. We then make some recommendations for best practice, which we demonstrate using R software for the Lower Palaeolithic “elephant butchery site” at Southfleet Road, Ebbsfleet, UK, excavated in 2004.

We build on this literature by examining publics’ perceptions of nations and development in internet search data, which we argue offers additional insights into publics’ perceptions that survey data does not address. Our analysis finds that developmental idealism is prevalent in international internet searches about countries. A consistent mental image of national development emerges from the traits publics ascribe to countries in internet searches. We find a positive relationship between the sentiment expressed in Google searches about a given country and its position in the global developmental hierarchy. Diverse publics consistently associate positive attributes to countries ranked high on global development indices and negative characteristics to countries ranked low. We also find a positive correlation between the number of internet searches about a country and the country’s position in indices of global development.

Instrumentos de escritura como arma en la historia y la literatura,"From the time when, according to the Babylonian Talmud, Jewish students tried unsuccessfully to defend themselves from the swords of the Roman army with their writing styli, until the present, writing instruments have been used as weapons in real life, literature, cinema and television, but until now this history had not been compiled. In cinema, the first record is ""The Naked Gun"" (1988), with fountain pen, and the most recent, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (2017), with pencil. On television, the record goes from ""CSI: Miami"" (2010) to ""Forever"" (2015), both by pen wounds to the carotid. In real life, uses range from military weapons to opportunistic assassinations. In World War II, the British government developed pens with daggers and explosive pens; and gun pens have been used by governments and by criminals in Vietnam, Russia and North Korea. Recent cases include Jason Webster, the ""pen killer"" of the University of Hull, and the enigmatic Mr. Xu, the Chinese fountain pen air-pirate.

Technology firm Microsoft has since led a campaign to convince states and firms to renounce certain cyber operations, advocating for what company President Brad Smith called a “Digital Geneva Convention.” Microsoft’s April 2018 “Cybersecurity Tech Accord” (CTA) now has 69 members spanning various industries and regions of the world, who have signed on to four principles that some see as the building blocks of an alternative norms process opposing state cyber operations.
