Evidence and methods used by anthropologists to identify violent events, as well as anthropological theories regarding why individuals choose violence, are discussed. A general social-environmental model is presented and explored through four case studies, two archaeological and two ethnographic.
Recent Findings: Recent research with historic and contemporary case studies suggests that resource uncertainty interacts with a complex array of pre-existing social and environmental conditions, including environmental degradation, poor governance, and social inequality, to promote violent responses both before and following climatic changes. Individuals may choose to avoid violence where supporting, cooperative mechanisms exist.
Summary: Given that individuals make choices to respond violently or not based on their perceptions of these complex, interacting social and environmental conditions, violence in response to global climate change is not inevitable.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|conflict|cooperation|governance|resource uncertainty|social-environmental system|social inequality|structural violence,2018-07-02T11:17:50.101831,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-24T16:06:58.738989,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/citation/,zxtnc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ur3qc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/relationships/node/,ur3qc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ef635f9ad5a102645a8f6a/,59ef635f9ad5a102645a8f6a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zxtnc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zxtnc/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641-017-0076-8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zxtnc

Rather than studying a corporate regime in which the actors are managers, supervisors and workers, this study looks at the organizational interactions among teachers and paraprofessionals in one large, urban and unionized school district in the U.S. We look at skill, care and respect as three dimensions of interaction embedded in the occupational demands and specific job requirements of teachers and paraprofessionals, and some of the tensions this regime produces between the largely White teachers and the women of color who are the paraprofessionals.

This paper draws on an ethnography of a superstore in Ireland to examine how these systems modulate the functioning of the store and working practices of employees. It was found that retail work involves a continual movement between a governance regime of control reliant on big data systems which seek to regulate and harnesses formal labour and automation into enterprise planning, and a disciplinary regime that deals with the symbolic, interactive labour that workers perform and acts as a reserve mode of governmentality if control fails. This continual movement is caused by new systems of control being open to vertical and horizontal fissures.

Exploiting quasi-experimental variation from the 1972 raising of the school leaving age in England and Wales, an additional year of schooling improves working memory by one- to two-thirds of a standard deviation. Limited evidence was detected for causal effects on verbal fluency and numeric ability. Analyses of the underlying mechanisms show occupation can explain up to about one-fifth of schooling’s effects on memory. However these figures are imprecisely estimated, and the role of occupation remains an area for further study.",TRUE,FALSE,1972 RoSLA|Ageing|Causal mechanisms|Cognitive function|Education|Health|Occupation|RoSLA|Schooling|Skills,2018-07-02T11:17:47.108278,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-23T11:01:31.509673,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/citation/,t647a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/23cbs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/relationships/node/,23cbs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59edca9bb83f690261752ec1/,59edca9bb83f690261752ec1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t647a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t647a/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t647a

There are contradictory results both in the studies of different countries and within countries. This variety of results makes it impossible to transfer the findings from one academic system to another, and in Russia this problem has been under-explored. This paper focuses on the relationship between inbreeding and publication activity among Russian faculty. The research was conducted using the data from the ‘Monitoring of educational markets and organizations’ survey. The results show that there is no significant effect of academic inbreeding on publication productivity: no substantial and robust differences in publication activity between inbreds and non-inbred have been found. The paper finishes with the discussion of possible explanations inherent in the Russian academic system.",TRUE,FALSE,academic inbreeding|academic profession|faculty|higher education|publication activity|Russian higher education,2018-07-02T11:16:55.914236,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-21T21:44:43.996483,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d71|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d73|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision|Higher Education Administration,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/citation/,h4sed,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e6skn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/relationships/node/,e6skn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ebbc616c613b02622ec8b9/,59ebbc616c613b02622ec8b9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h4sed/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h4sed/,https://doi.org/10.1080/13583883.2017.1395905,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h4sed

Multigenerational Correlations in Family Wealth,"Inequality in family wealth is high, yet we know little about how much and how wealth inequality is maintained across generations. We argue that a long-term perspective reflective of wealth’s cumulative nature is crucial to understand the extent and channels of wealth reproduction across generations. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that span nearly half a century, we show that a one decile increase in parents’ wealth position is associated with an increase of about 4 percentiles in their offspring’s wealth position in adulthood. We show that grandparental wealth is a unique predictor of grandchildren’s wealth, above and beyond the role of parental wealth, suggesting that a focus on only parent-child dyads understates the importance of family wealth lineages. Second, considering five channels of wealth transmission — gifts and bequests, education, marriage, homeownership, and business ownership — we find that most of the advantages arising from family wealth begin much earlier in the life-course than the common focus on bequests implies, even when we consider the wealth of grandparents. We also document the stark disadvantage of African-American households in terms of not only their wealth attainment but also their intergenerational wealth mobility compared to whites.",TRUE,FALSE,Family|Life Course|Multigenerational|Social Mobility|Wealth,2018-07-02T11:16:54.183403,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-20T20:19:54.024639,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/citation/,djq3p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/um8kf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/relationships/node/,um8kf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ea598e594d9002640f6b0d/,59ea598e594d9002640f6b0d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djq3p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/djq3p/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/djq3p
