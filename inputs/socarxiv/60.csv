This study aims to scrutinize some aspects of the translation of idiomatic expressions in a mystery movie entitled ‘Murder on the Orient Express’. Seventy-seven idiomatic expressions were found in the movie. The idioms can be categorized as follows: keywords with idiomatic uses (16) idioms with nouns and adjectives (2), idiomatic pairs (1), idioms with prepositions (7), phrasal verbs idioms (26), verbal idioms (5), idioms from special subjects (1), idioms with key words from special categories (16), and idioms with comparison (3). Phrasal verbs idiom was the most frequently occurred because idioms are mostly organized by verb comprising the combination of verb and preposition or verb and adverb. Further, the rendering of the idioms from English as the Source Language (SL) into Indonesian as the Target Language (TL) employed some strategies; translation by paraphrase was the highly frequent translation strategy. The strategy of using an idiom of similar meaning but dissimilar form was also located in the high-frequency position of the continuum. Furthermore, using an idiom of similar form and meaning and translation by omission were the translation strategies of low frequency. Translation by paraphrase was frequently used because the translator wanted to convey the meaning as clearly as possible while also considering the cultural difference between SL and TL. To sum up, the idiomatic expression dominantly used in the movie was phrasal verbs (34%), while the strategy that was mostly applied in translating them was translation by paraphrase (56%).",TRUE,FALSE,figurative meaning|idiomatic translation|idioms|literal meaning|translation strategies,2021-03-17T19:43:21.004074,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:42:58.136440,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/citation/,pwthj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60516c4d5ca6c700c978ce63/,60516c4d5ca6c700c978ce63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwthj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pwthj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pwthj

The play starts with the protagonist’s strong assertion that she is endangering her life working in different war zones just to help the victims of wars by showing the world pictures of their suffering. After surviving a deadly road-bomb accident, Sarah Goodwin decided to settle down at home and never return to dangerous zones. However, after six months of recovery, this female war journalist decided to return to war zones. The present study finds it intriguing to speculate on Sarah Goodwin’s determination to return to such zones at such a time of her life. Through consulting some aspects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and different aspects of Jacques Lacan’s words on photography, lack, and absence, the present study concludes that the protagonist’s desire to go back to war zones does not just help show the world pictures of wars victims’ suffering, but it helps the protagonist construct her own identity. Photography/war journalism becomes a medium through which Sarah Goodwin asserts her identity as a human being as she cannot fulfill her feminine role as a nurturer in a patriarchal society. The audience realizes that through photography, the protagonist projects her sense of lack and pain and attempts to attain some sense of wholeness.",TRUE,FALSE,identity|lack|masculine|photography|post-traumatic stress|Time Stands Still|war journalism,2021-03-17T19:43:20.916043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:43:11.684022,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/citation/,bq3pe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60516ba5ae403d00bc97d966/,60516ba5ae403d00bc97d966,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bq3pe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bq3pe/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bq3pe

But has MT fully succeeded in replacing traditional dictionaries and providing an ideal tool for vocabulary acquisition among L2 learners? This study aimed to research the value and implications of using machine translation in vocabulary acquisition. The study is significant as it investigates a neglected area in teaching a second language focusing on the role of MT in vocabulary acquisition. The empirical study adopted a combined quantitative and qualitative methodology that tested students’ skills in answering vocabulary questions in context by using online translators. Forty-seven participants took part in the assessment voluntarily, and they were all fourth-year students about to graduate from an Omani private university. The findings confirmed the results of earlier research about the challenges ESL learners face in vocabulary acquisition, including difficulties in processing sequential lexical patterns and using vocabulary communicatively. The results further revealed that online translators do not provide an optimal solution to overcome obstacles in using vocabulary unless accompanied by higher metacognitive skills such as critical thinking and using words in context.

Throughout his works, including the Mercian Hymns, historical events and figures play a central role. When references to the past make their way into literature, the resulting allusions often broaden the work’s depth, increasing not just the richness of the symbolic interpretation but also rooting the work into a multidisciplinary conversation, bringing events from different points along the human timeline into the conversation. When anachronism occurs, the intentionality plays a role in determining the significance not just of the instance but, potentially, the work as a whole.

To answer this question, it is necessary to analyze the practical knowledge acquired by these professionals in the preparation phase.

He spent his most prolific late years searching for new aesthetics and promoting a culture of free thinking. Abandoning his prior commitment to achieving the modern state, Arabic unity, the liberation of Palestine and the triumph of communism, he started creating individuals who are caught up in conflicting passions, loyalties and choices. However, his new themes will still betray a will to reform the many ailments in Arabic culture and politics, such as politico-religious coalitions and colonialism. This article will study the artistic and ideological transformation in Wannous’s later drama. It will also explore the later pro-democracy trends through analyzing the emerging individualism in characterization and the plurality of discourses in the plays of the later period 1989-1997, namely The Rape (1989), Historical Miniatures (1993), Miserable Dreams (1994), Rituals of Signs and Transformations (1994), and Drunken Days (1997).",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-17T19:48:52.781702,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:48:16.990384,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/citation/,jbm67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605167b35ca6c700c878a156/,605167b35ca6c700c878a156,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbm67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jbm67/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jbm67

Using a large public dataset of almost 60000 dating profiles, containing written text for each profile, we look for a methodology to measure author style. We focus on education and essays fields in each profile from which we try to identify relevant features of written text that reveal the level of education of authors behind texts. Using different types of extracted features, we explore the level of education within three approaches: (i) classifying the level of education to elementary or higher education using lexical features; (ii) using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features; (iii) combining LIWC features and lexical features. For classification, we rely on regularized logistic regression. The joint model which uses both lexical and LIWC features predicts the education level better than other text representation models, but the contribution of LIWC is marginal. Our results may not only be useful in the context of the platform economy and online markets, also more generally to researchers who need to rely on written text as an indicator of educational background.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-16T16:53:00.889451,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-16T15:53:03.569215,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/citation/,rds8z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6050cdc7ae403d006097c7ad/,6050cdc7ae403d006097c7ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rds8z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rds8z/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rds8z

We argue that evidence-based medicine relies on research and data to create pathways for patient journeys. Coupled with data-based algorithmic prediction tools in healthcare, they establish what could be called health algorithmics – a mode of management of healthcare that produces forms of algorithmic governmentality. Relying on a critical posthumanist perspective, we show how healthcare algorithmics is contingent on the way authority over bodies is produced and how predictive healthcare algorithms reproduce inequalities of the worlds from which they are made, centering possible futures on existing normativities regulated through algorithmic biopower. In contrast to that, we explore posthuman speculative ethics was a way to challenge understanding of “ethics” and “care” in healthcare algorithmics. We suggest some possible avenues towards working speculative ethics into healthcare while still being critically attentive to algorithmic modes of management and prediction in healthcare",TRUE,FALSE,bias|ethics|evidence based medicine|prejudice,2021-03-17T18:20:22.700520,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T18:19:55.083261,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/citation/,x3y29,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6050b2045ca6c7005978df33/,6050b2045ca6c7005978df33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3y29/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x3y29/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x3y29
