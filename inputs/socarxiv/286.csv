They are said to lack accuracy, encourage gaming and ultimately fail to improve performance. Yet, despite their well-documented weaknesses, performance indicators abound in governance. This article asks under which conditions performance indicators can improve performance outcomes, despite these proven weaknesses and dysfunctions. Our case study is the stress test of the European banking system, a high-profile performance indicator used for risk regulation. Based on interviews with risk managers in Belgian banks as well as staff at the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and the National Bank of Belgium, we find that the process of calculating the stress test improves performance outcomes in itself. It does so by fostering banks’ capacity to self-regulate, tying into Foucault’s notion of governmentality. As such, practitioners and academics should not only pay attention to how performance results can be used, but also examine how the process of calculating the performance indicator might be designed to improve performance outcomes latently.",TRUE,FALSE,governmentality|performance indicators|stress test,2019-11-24T19:55:40.844428,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-24T19:55:28.978723,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/citation/,vf9yn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7e7466fc769000ad4d9c4/,5dd7e7466fc769000ad4d9c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vf9yn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vf9yn,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020852319857804

Historians have discussed whether the individual assemblies in the sixteenth and seventeenth century could be seen as a consistent institution, what constituencies were represented there, what role they played in the relations of the Tsar with his subjects, and if they were similar to the early modern assemblies elsewhere. The growing historiographic consensus does not see the early modern Russian assemblies as an institution. In the nineteenth–early twentieth century, history writing and myth-making integrated the zemskii sobor into the argumentations of both the opponents and the proponents of parliamentarism in Russia. The autocratic mythology, perpetuated by the Slavophiles in the second half of the nineteenth century, proved more coherent yet did not achieve the recognition from the Tsars. The democratic mythology was more heterogeneous and, despite occasionally fading to the background of the debates, lasted for some hundred years between the 1820s and the 1920s. Initially, the autocratic approach to the zemskii sobor was idealistic, but it became more practical at the summit of its popularity during the Revolution of 1905–1907, when the zemskii sobor was discussed by the government as a way to avoid bigger concessions. Regionalist approaches to Russia’s past and future became formative for the democratic mythology of the zemskii sobor, which persisted as part of the romantic nationalist imagery well into the Russian Civil War of 1918–1922. The zemskii sobor came to represent a Russian constituent assembly, destined to mend the post-imperial crisis. The two mythologies converged in the Priamur Zemskii Sobor, which assembled in Vladivostok in 1922 and became the first assembly to include the term into its official name.",TRUE,FALSE,Assembly of the Land|intellectual history|liberalism|nationalism|regionalism|Russia|Slavophiles|Zemskii Sobor|Zemsky Sobor|Земский собор,2019-11-22T19:21:03.482739,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-22T19:20:29.825144,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/citation/,bh8xg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7e5cc215a8f000b4d1894/,5dd7e5cc215a8f000b4d1894,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bh8xg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bh8xg,NA

The game of football (soccer) provides a wealth of real world data with which to quantify managers' use of personal and social information in selecting team formations. I analyse a 5-year dataset of all games (n=9127, 2012-2017) in the five top European leagues (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga, French Ligue 1 and Italian Serie A) to quantify the extent to which a manager's initial match formation is guided by their personal past use or success with that formation, or other managers' use or success with that formation. I focus in particular on the use of the 4231 formation, which was the dominant formation at the start of this period but showed a gradual decline in use over time. I find that, as predicted, a manager's choice of whether to use 4231 or not is influenced by both their recent use of 4231 (personal information) and the use of 4231 in the entire population of managers in that division (social information). Contrary to expectations, managers appeared to rely more on personal than social information, although this estimate was highly variable across managers and divisions. Serie A managers, in particular, showed a much stronger use of personal information, likely due to the rarity of 4231 in that division. Finally, there did not appear to be an adaptive tradeoff between social and personal information use, with the relative reliance on each failing to predict managerial success.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|football|social learning|sport,2019-11-22T19:19:01.696996,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-22T19:18:40.233966,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/citation/,wrx9f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pg9cz/,pg9cz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7d64e6fc769000ad4ca76/,5dd7d64e6fc769000ad4ca76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wrx9f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wrx9f,NA

In total, sixty-six proceedings are currently ongoing before the Court. The first application was made in 2013, the most recent in 2018. Russia has to respond to complaints by an expansive number of (members of) NGOs (such as Ecodefence, Levada Centre, North Caucasus Environmental Watch and Eco-Logica).
Remarking on the need to search for a responsive and viable mechanism of formal dispute resolution in the cross-border funding of NGOs context, L.H. Mayer (2018; in 'Globalization Without a Safety Net: The Challenge of Protecting Cross-Border Funding of NGOs', Minnesota Law Review, 102(3), p. 1265) has put forth to especially look at member state funded mechanisms such as regional human rights agreements. The ECHR likely holds the best option for a level-playing field in this context, although a fully tested outcome is lacking at the moment.
I look into comparative materials from the Court's decisional law related to Freedom of expression (Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights - ECHR), including the applicability of the freedom to receive and impart information.  I also sketch how some other Articles of the Convention are interlinked. The term “political activity” is central to the arguments raised. I discuss separately how that term could be treated in light of the case law of the ECtHR about Article 16 of the ECHR at the end of this paper.

The key insight is that distance in the statements made by companies can be partially indicative of their strategic positioning with respect to each other.  We formalize this insight by proposing a new measure of strategic positioning---the strategy score---and defining the assumptions and conditions under which we can estimate it empirically.  We then implement this approach to score the strategic positioning of a large sample of startups in Crunchbase in relation to contemporaneous public companies.  Startups with a higher founding strategy score have higher equity outcomes, reside in locations with more venture capital, and receive a higher amount of financing in seed financing events.  One implication of this result is that founding strategic positioning is important for startup performance.",TRUE,FALSE,Entrepreneurship|Machine Learning|Strategic Positioning|Strategy|Text Analysis,2019-11-22T19:15:22.284828,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-22T19:15:00.340463,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/citation/,7cvge,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd6c5981d56d2000ee2a343/,5dd6c5981d56d2000ee2a343,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7cvge/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7cvge/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7cvge,NA

This study examines gender-of-interviewer effects in gender ideologies among respondents, interviewed by different interviewers in multiple waves of a large-scale panel survey in Germany. By applying fixed-effects models to data from the adult cohort of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), the study finds that respondents report more egalitarian views to female interviewers. While gender-of-interviewer effects were more pronounced for men, in West Germany, and for egalitarian slanted attitude items, further effect heterogeneity seemed to be relatively low for respondents’ characteristics. The results illustrate the influence of the interview situation on sensitive questions and their methodological consideration in further research.",TRUE,FALSE,gender ideology|gender role attitudes|heterogeneity|interviewer effects|social desirability,2019-11-21T17:14:21.671630,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-21T17:14:00.221177,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/citation/,wsjrh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd694702fefe5000d7d8840/,5dd694702fefe5000d7d8840,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wsjrh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wsjrh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wsjrh,NA
