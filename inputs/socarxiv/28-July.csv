We conducted interviews with people with a disability and disability service providers to develop survey items, then conducted a survey with 2000 adult Australian residents who either had a disability or were carers of a person with a disability. After conducting descriptive analyses and data-driven market segmentation, findings revealed that, at the aggregate level, basic or functional benefits of disability services are most important. However, when accounting for heterogeneity, very distinct benefit patterns emerge, pointing to the substantial potential for improving disability services by catering to distinct market segment needs. These insights have the potential to improve disability service provision, thus maximally harvesting the opportunities from disability service models that now often include commercial providers, and enabling people with disabilities to make optimal choices in relation to both services and providers.",TRUE,FALSE,consumer preferences|disability|heterogeneity|market segmentation|theory of consumption values,2021-06-10T12:02:02.059354,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-10T12:01:41.167689,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/citation/,8qysd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c02cbf18f70b003ba7b5e3/,60c02cbf18f70b003ba7b5e3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8qysd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8qysd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8qysd

This book explains how Sukarno's desire to have nuclear weapons. This book itself has three chapters explaining in detail and coherently how this incident happened, starting from the first chapter, which describes the state of the cold war that caused Indonesia to become involved in it and how President Sukarno's attitude towards nuclear technology. The second chapter describes the formation of LTE, which later turned into BATAN due to changes in Sukarno's thinking in addressing the global political constellation and Western imperialism, which continued to hinder nuclear power. The third chapter describes Sukarno's ambition to have nuclear weapons in Indonesia, then the world response to these conditions, and the last one regarding the end of Sukarno's nuclear politics as it coincided with Suharto's downfall.
This book intends to look back on nuclear technology that came to the world's attention in the nuclear arms race after the end of the second world war to inform readers of Soekarno's ideas about nuclear technology, which impacted determining his government in the 1960s. Which at that time, not a few Western countries gave a cautionary attitude. In addition, this book also aims to encourage interest in writing the history of technology in Indonesia because there are still many who ignore science and technology in influencing Indonesian history.
This book intends for those who are thirsty for knowledge and always want more insight. Sukarno's Nuclear Book is also very suitable for those who like Indonesian history, especially the history of technology in Indonesia which has had much influence in it. Then for those who like compilation, this book is very suitable because, in the book Nuclear Sukarno, the CIA has been involved in Indonesian history. After reading the book Nuclear Sukarno, much information is obtained by readers, such as in the economic, political, social, and cultural fields that are the reasons for writing Indonesian history; it turns out that technology itself also influences the current situation in Indonesia.

Research suggests that this generation is different from others in their values and life priorities and will challenge organizations who wish to attract, develop, and retain its members while ensuring the same level of operations. We present a simulation-based approach to understanding how peer selection and peer influence drive the spread of behaviors, values, and beliefs through social networks of youths, and how organizations can use influence pathways in such networks to recruit and develop their personnel. We illustrate our approach on a case study of United States Marine Corps (USMC) recruiting and training. We detail the logic and theoretical underpinnings of our model and describe how it allows to understand the driving forces of generational changes in the young American population and how they might be addressed. We show that while peer influence with respect to relevant Marines' traits is a highly elastic process, peer selection is rooted in deep-seated, slowly changing individual perceptions. We further show that peer influence is confined to intimate networks, making intervention difficult.

Although several scholars have proclaimed the benefits of adopting LS in international educational systems, it is still unclear how LS has been used and how it should be implemented in cultures beyond Japan. In order to shed light on the theme, an International Systematic Literature Review was conducted aiming to (1) identify specific features of LS practices as they are developed in different settings, (2) verify and analyze what cultural aspects may have impacted the implementation of LS, and (3) verify and develop analysis of challenges for the use of successful practices of LS in international contexts. 5 international academic databases were searched in order to identify 28 publications. This investigation provides multiple evidences of the fast global spread of LS and reveals that some key adaptations or redesigns are conducted so that LS meets local needs and conditions.

Evidence from a European survey of online platform workers,"Children tend to inherit their parents’ social class through the types of jobs they get. However, digital technologies are now transforming the way labour markets work. Candidates are increasingly screened using algorithmic decision making. Skills are validated with online tests and customer feedback ratings. Workplace communications take place over digital media. Could these transformations be undermining the advantages that have accrued to workers with posh accents, family connections, and expensively acquired educational qualifications? We examine this question with survey data from the online (remote) platform economy, a labour market segment in which these digital transformations have progressed furthest (N = 983). The results reveal that online platform workers come largely from privileged class backgrounds. Class also influences (via education) what types of online occupations workers do, from professional services to data entry. However, class background has surprisingly little influence on job quality, which is instead shaped by individual digital metrics such as feedback ratings. These findings cannot be fully reconciled with theories of a shift towards meritocracy nor with theories of a persisting influence of class origins.

The understanding of AP in multiparty systems remains limited. We study AP in Finland, characterized by a strong multiparty system and a low level of ideological polarization, between 2007 and 2019. We find that AP has increased, driven mainly by voters evaluating their least favorite party more negatively. We also propose an approach that goes beyond earlier literature, which has mostly used a single aggregate metric to measure AP. Using latent profile analysis, we find that voters are grouped into blocs that view some parties positively and others negatively. This suggests that the complex dynamics of AP in multiparty democracies involve relationships between not just individual parties but between what we call affective blocs that span across party lines.",TRUE,FALSE,affective polarization|latent profile analysis|partisanship|political polarization,2021-06-08T13:39:28.807127,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-08T13:38:45.687057,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.vaalitutkimus.fi/en/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,Arto Kekkonen &amp; Tuomas Ylä-Anttila,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/citation/,xzunf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60bf5b7fcb2a5e058a690462/,60bf5b7fcb2a5e058a690462,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzunf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xzunf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xzunf

A central yet often neglected aspect in the development of indicator sets concerns the elaboration of accompanying conceptual frameworks. Despite the pivotal role that such frameworks play, and the normative power they wield, little explicit guidance exists for their development. To address this issue, we analyze an extensive sample of conceptual frameworks drawn from 67 urban indicator initiatives. The results of the analysis elaborate an empirically-based typology of four principal and two emerging framework types, each based on a particular logic for creating conceptual categories for urban sustainability indicators. We also develop a comparison of the framework types in terms of their respective abilities to meet the different purposes that conceptual frameworks ideally serve in indicator set development. The results allow us to provide much-needed guidance for indicator set developers; first, by laying out the range of options available; second, by helping developers choose between types of frameworks in accordance with their particular aims. In addition, through analysis of how urban sustainability is de facto defined in indicator initiatives, we aim to make a conceptual contribution that advances our understanding of the meaning of this complex concept.",TRUE,FALSE,conceptual frameworks|indicators|sustainability|urban systems,2021-06-08T13:40:01.201745,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-08T13:39:32.498327,FALSE,NA,no,Contact authors for information on the data used,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/citation/,vayq7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5cn3a/,5cn3a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60bf31b83a6df105c7d4db57/,60bf31b83a6df105c7d4db57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vayq7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vayq7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vayq7

Here, we investigate how the co-occurrence of critical events and, in particular, the spacing in time of events across the life course influences life satisfaction in later life. We argue that life phases densely populated of critical events may translate into an acute resource drain affecting wellbeing in long term more strongly than if the same events were sparsely distributed. We use retrospective biographical information on critical events in family, work, health and residential trajectories in Switzerland to construct a life course Concentration Index of events based on the number, the time-lag between the occurrences and the number of life domains involved. Our results show that the higher is the concentration in time of critical events, the stronger will be their negative long-term effect on wellbeing, net of socio-demographic characteristics, of the total number of events ever experienced and of the time since the last event. Furthermore, such negative effect is even stronger if the person experienced periods dense of events during midlife and older adulthood than during youth or early adulthood.",TRUE,FALSE,concentration|critical events|life course|life stages|subjective wellbeing,2021-06-08T13:38:44.195366,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-08T13:38:00.055621,FALSE,NA,no,Swiss Household Panel (SHP) Data is available at https://forsbase.unil.ch/ after signing a data sharing agreement,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,Chiara L.
