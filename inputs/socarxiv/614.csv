The present study provides an evaluative perspective with regard to the directions of influences among them.  A model that reflects the hypothesis that epistemic beliefs affect strategies use in reading to read which are strengthened by reading motivation is constructed and tested. The structural equation modeling (SEM) confirms this hypothesis, which implies interdependences across the factors as promising resources that can be utilized in EFL reading context for comprehension development.

It denotes learners’ ability to think, analyze and draw conclusions about the taught information. Different approaches were  implemented to promote EFL learners’ critical thinking but they were limited into questioning strategies that raise speculation.   The present paper is an investigation of the advantages of implementing technology devices to promote Algerian University EFL learners’ higher order thinking. Noticing that their  written productions in literature carried almost no critical thinking aspects , this case study attempts to check the usability of E learning in developing EFL learners’ ability to think critically through a qualitative method of research. The study is based on data obtained from a questionnaire administered to   second year students on their attitude towards replacing the traditional classroom by a technology classroom. An E-learning test was initiated through Emails to deliver and correct  home works where analysis and speculation questions were designed. The results showed that 83% of the sample were in favour of change and admitted that they spend more than 2 hours a day using their digital devices for entertainment as well as for research.

The investigation was conducted at the department of English at Abdelhamid Ibn Badis University. The department has witnessed a huge increase in the enrolment figure in the past decade which resulted into an increase in class sizes. This has created problems for staff and students alike. Despite the steps taken by the administrators to reduce the number of students, the problem of  class crowding still persists. The department of English, alone, has an enrolment of almost 3000 students, it is a huge number indeed if we take into consideration the availability of facilities and resources. The aim of this study is to explore the organizational and pedagogical difficulties that are frequently encountered by the teachers dealing with large classes and the effects on student learning. Additionally, this paper proposes some suggestions on how to deal with class overcrowding. As part of our research, we have given questionnaires to 200 students and 40 teachers.

In general, since second language learners experience difficulties with grammatical tenses, these dictogloss tasks (which were developed by Wajnryb (1990) and preformed either with pairs or small groups) were utilized to find out whether their application lead to better performance on grammar tests, particularly in regard to verb tense accuracy. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of using the dictogloss task procedure on female Translation university students enrolled in Grammar (1) at the College of Languages and Translation (COLT), King Saud University (KSU), Riyadh. The study also aimed to survey participants' attitudes and perceptions toward the application of dictogloss tasks. The researcher applied a quasi-experimental design model and survey research. The findings of the study demonstrated that in general, there was no significant statistical difference in verb-tense performance between the three groups’ weekly test scores that were immediately administered after presenting dictogloss tasks, but most students, in both experimental groups, expressed satisfaction with the dictogloss task as a whole. It is recommended that future researchers investigate whether and to what extent FonF tasks, such as the dictogloss, are effective for the different proficiency levels for which they are intended to appropriately generalize the findings to other contexts and/or language skills, and identify how instruction and reinforcement can be best designed to promote second language learning.",TRUE,FALSE,dictogloss|focus on form|FonF|grammar|traditional exercises,2018-07-02T11:03:34.816809,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:29:57.925478,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/citation/,t826f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wrkc7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/relationships/node/,wrkc7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972d42b9ad5a1023755cfef/,5972d42b9ad5a1023755cfef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t826f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t826f/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.24,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t826f

The participants included 100 students (55 male, 45 female). All participants were pursuing their third years of study in an English department.  Two instruments were employed: questionnaires regarding Motivation for Foreign Language Learning (MFLL) and Vocabulary Size Test (VST). The primary goal of this study is to determine which factors of motivation profoundly affect the foreign language learning processes of Iraqi EFL students and to what extent they should develop their depth and breadth English vocabularies in order to sufficiently acquire the language and elaborate the importance of both components in language acquisition. Findings showed that female students experienced both types of motivation, with the mean score of extrinsic motivation being 29.91, and that for intrinsic motivation being 31.20, while the mean score of male students was 27.10 for extrinsic motivation and 28.00 for intrinsic motivation. The VST ranged from 1,000 to 14,000 word-families, and the vocabulary size of both groups was over 6,000 word-families. Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between learner motivation and vocabulary size.

Different approaches and methods have emerged throughout the history of language learning/teaching based on the influence of different theories of language, psychology, and related domains such as psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, pragmatics and cultural studies. Two major trends in language teaching emerged under the influence of these mentioned language theories, namely, accuracy based versus fluency based approaches. This article gives a historical sketch up to these trends in an attempt to provide a historical background and to empirically bring evidence that wait time instruction and teaching experience can impact classroom feedback in Moroccan classes. Relevant questions related to the role of teachers’ experience in leading different types of feedback, the effect of the number of teaching years as well as the correlation between wait time instruction and the corresponding teaching experience are closely investigated. This article adheres to a mixed design or what has been identified in research methodology as ex-post facto (Cohen, Manion, Morrison, 2007). Therefore, it is both a qualitative and a descriptive one. For the type of instructions used, the results obtained show the insignificance of the impact of experience on this variable. On the other hand, results retained that wait- time instruction in comparison to other items recorded a higher significance of the impact of experience. Therefore, current article brings empirical evidence on how wait- time instruction plays a crucial role in spoken activity for second language learners.",TRUE,FALSE,impact of teaching experience|impact of wait –time instruction|speaking classes|teachers’ instructions and feedback,2018-07-02T11:03:34.560397,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:04:26.746761,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/citation/,d2vey,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gyd95/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/relationships/node/,gyd95,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972ce466c613b022a373466/,5972ce466c613b022a373466,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2vey/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d2vey/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d2vey

It focuses on the pattern of non-derived, triliteral verbs /maCCu:C/. The sample of the study is collected from three sources Wehr (1994), Wright (1996), and Al-waSi:T Dictionary (2004). The study discusses strong, weak, geminated, and glottalized verbs using the X-skeleton of autosegmental phonology. It considers the imperfective stem as the basic form from which other forms are derived. The findings indicate that strong, geminated, and glottalized stems show regularity to the pattern /maCCu:C/. Nevertheless, irregularities from the general pattern are observed with weak verbs due to the unstable nature of glides in Standard Arabic. Also, the study shows that autosegmental phonology provides an adequate analysis for the passive participle.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic passive participle|autosegmental|phonological analysis|X-skeleton,2018-07-02T11:03:34.521248,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-22T04:01:08.471580,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/citation/,p3jcr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jbwfu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/relationships/node/,jbwfu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5972cd2eb83f690228300c46/,5972cd2eb83f690228300c46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p3jcr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p3jcr/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no2.18,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p3jcr
