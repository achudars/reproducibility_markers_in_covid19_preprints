More than 5.7 million in total, Obama-to-Trump voters were essential to Trump’s victory in the Electoral College.  They were more likely to be white, working class, and resident in the Midwest.  They had lower levels of political interest, were centrist in both party affiliation and ideology, and were late deciders for the 2016 election.  On economic interests, they were centrists, except for trade policy, which they viewed, on average, as a greater threat than other voters.  They claimed to have more experience with economic vulnerability than Democratic loyalists of comparable social standing.  On racial attitudes, including the racialized economic topic of immigration, they had a profile similar to Republican loyalists.  While their support of Trump may be attributable to surging white nativism, this article argues for an alternative explanation.  Voters who were attracted by Trump’s economic populism only joined his coalition if they could accept his racialized rhetoric.

Using data on lung obstruction from the WHO Survey of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE 2007-08), this paper studies the determinants of respiratory health in India, home to a third of all deaths from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. First, we find that smokers and members of households that use solid fuels (wood, biomass, coal or dung) for cooking have higher lung obstruction. Second, even if a respondent's household uses clean fuels, their lung obstruction is higher if their neighbors use solid fuels. In neighborhoods with high solid fuel use, the lungs of members of households that use clean fuels can be as obstructed as lungs of members of households that use solid fuels. These negative externalities of solid fuel use are robust to additional controls for neighborhood socioeconomic status, falsification tests, tests with placebo measures, and tests using alternative measures of respiratory health as outcomes. Third, the influence of the determinants is patterned by gender. Smoking tobacco is an important influence on lung obstruction among men. Confirming non-linear dose-response relationships, we find that women from households that use solid fuels are the only group not further harmed by neighborhood solid fuel smoke, possibly because of high exposure to pollutants while cooking. The study improves our understanding of behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of respiratory health in India. Importantly, it makes a case for greater public investments to promote the adoption and use of cleaner fuels.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|India|lung obstruction|negative externalities|respiratory health|solid fuels,2019-06-04T11:33:52.763942,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:29:33.589386,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/citation/,45fn6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf2e8202a50c4001983cfe2/,5cf2e8202a50c4001983cfe2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45fn6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/45fn6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/45fn6

This study develops a simulation model that incorporates two of the ways that ideas can change as they spread from person to person.  First, ideas can be misinterpreted, or repeated to another person with error.  Second, people can generate new ideas by recombining two schemas, meaning two frameworks for ideas that they already know.  To simulate this, I seed a population with a set of 3 bit idea frameworks, which I refer to as schemas, and then simulate communication by letting a person draw a 5 bit string from the 3 bit schema, or by creatively recombining 2 3-bit frameworks into a 5 bit string.  The recipient of the 5-bit string matches the received string to the set of schemas that he or she already knows.  If he or she receives several bits that cannot be matched to an existing schema, he or she creates a new one.  To explore the parameter space, I vary the probability with which people draw from a single schema versus combining two existing schemas.  The results of this simulation suggest, paradoxically, that creatively recombining schemas leads to less diverse outcomes, and that some ideas are more likely to stick than others.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-01T00:33:46.958504,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-01T00:33:21.941903,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/citation/,85ez6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf1c3e623fec4001ae8ef50/,5cf1c3e623fec4001ae8ef50,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85ez6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/85ez6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/85ez6

We estimate the causal effect of Mohammed Salah—a visibly Muslim soccer player— joining Liverpool Football Club on Islamophobia, using hate crime reports throughout England, 15 million tweets from British soccer fans, and a survey experiment of Liverpool F.C. fans. We find that hate crimes in Merseyside (home to Liverpool F.C.) dropped by 16% compared to a synthetic control, and Liverpool F.C. fans halved their rates of posting anti-Muslim tweets relative to fans of other top-flight clubs. Our survey experiment suggests that the salience of Salah’s Muslim identity enabled positive feelings toward Salah to generalize to Muslims more broadly.

If party labels are a heuristic, we would expect  party-line voting to be even more dominant in lower-information elections. Yet, here I show that the prevalence of ticket splitting in state and local offices is often similar to or higher than in national offices because of larger incumbency advantages and starker candidate valence differentials. Because neither surveys nor election returns have been able to reliably measure individual vote choice in downballot races, I introduce an underused source of voter data: cast vote records. I create a database from voting machines that reveals the vote choices of 6.6 million voters for all offices on the long ballot, and I design a clustering algorithm tailored to such ballot data. In contrast to ticket splitting rates of 5 to 7 percent in US House races, about 15 to 20 percent of voters split their ticket in a modal Sheriff race.

But political ruptures carry no guarantee that democracy can overcome the accumulated inequalities of history. In South Africa, the transition to democracy shifted power from a racial minority in ways that suggested an unusually high probability of material change. This article analyzes the limits of public power after democratic transitions. Why has the post-Apartheid local state in Johannesburg been unable to achieve a spatially inclusive distribution of public goods despite a political imperative for both spatial and fiscal redistribution? I rely on interviews and archival research, conducted in Johannesburg between 2015 and 2018. Because the color line created a sharp distinction between political and economic power, traditional white elites required non-majoritarian and covert strategies that translated their structural power into effective power. The cumulative effect of these “weapons of the strong” was a form of institutional arbitrage that led the mostly black-led local state to exercise forbearance towards largely white wealthy residents’ associations and property developers. Through these strategies, elites repurposed institutional reforms for redistribution to instead reproduce the city’s inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,bureaucracy|democracy|elites|race,2019-05-31T01:25:41.640411,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-31T01:25:14.386241,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/citation/,g5y3b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf0307d2a50c40016801d23/,5cf0307d2a50c40016801d23,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g5y3b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g5y3b/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g5y3b

Mathematical models of social dynamics have been increasingly recognised as a powerful research tool in achieving this goal. Here, motivated by the fact that the dynamics of the ongoing Yellow Vest Movement in France exhibit anomalously long duration (currently it is in 30th week), we explore whether this can be a result of a dynamical systems phenomenon known as long transients. To this end, we build and study a hierarchy of mathematical models describing the ""population dynamics"" of the movement, i.e. how the number of protesters changes with time. We show that in these models long transients appear via two roots: via a ghost attractor and via an interaction of the slow and fast dynamics. We demonstrate that long transients are also present in some earlier models of social protests. Interestingly, our models predict that the Yellow Vest Movement should end abruptly by, at the latest, mid-summer 2019 without any interference from the French government. More generally, we argue that long transients are a generic feature of dynamical models describing social processes in the same way as they are in models of physical, ecological, and evolutionary systems.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-30T21:56:27.307806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-30T21:55:59.437541,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/citation/,tpyux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cef5d732a50c400167fb73d/,5cef5d732a50c400167fb73d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tpyux/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tpyux

While studies of political networks in these regimes focus on patron-client systems -- a classic centralization strategy --  I argue that political leaders are likely to pursue mixed strategies that blend patronage with more deferential strategies, including  elite brokerage.  This paper analyzes the role of patron-client ties and brokerage positions in Mexican cabinet appointments over a period of sixty years (1940-2000), demonstrating that elite brokers were more likely to be included in elite coalitions.  Although network theorists have argued that brokers are most important in ""factionalized"" elites, the results show that brokers were valued elite coalition partners during the period of consolidated one-party rule, but not during the earlier, more contested period of regime formation.  The analysis also suggests that patronage became less hierarchical as the regime consolidated, shifting towards a sponsorship system of competing patrons rather than a classic patronage pyramid.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-30T11:46:41.697209,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-30T11:46:23.486900,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/citation/,vb5gx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cee59118d6e0500186638ba/,5cee59118d6e0500186638ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5gx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vb5gx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vb5gx
