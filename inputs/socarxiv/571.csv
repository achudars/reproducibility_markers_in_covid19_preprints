Bifurcation of Private and Public Responsibilities in Criminal Punishment,"Who holds the legitimate right to punish criminals? While previous work has identified several factors that influence states’ decisions to delegate punishment duties to the private sector, it has not considered variation in the level of security required to implement the punishment. Delegating coercive power challenges commonly held assumptions about the appropriate locus of coercive power, and resistance is likely to be strongest when delegating highly secure services that require the greatest levels of physical coercion. Using data on American adult correctional facilities from 1990 to 2005, this article describes the current bifurcation of correctional contracting, wherein private contractors house increasing numbers of inmates in less secure correctional settings (e.g., low-security, community-based facilities) and public authorities retain near-monopoly control over inmates in highly secure settings (i.e., medium- and maximum-security prisons). Multinomial regression analyses reveal that states’ decisions to privatize highly secure facilities were associated with ideological and economic factors. However, the decision to privatize lower security facilities has become commonplace, and as a result has grown irrespective of state-level factors. These results suggest that handing over low-security services to the private sector has become a legitimate policy option, while privatizing the most secure services remains shrouded in illegitimacy.",TRUE,FALSE,legitimacy|private prisons|privatization|public policy|punishment,2018-07-10T11:50:22.581463,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-10T11:49:36.320873,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/citation/,bfkvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k46vt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/relationships/node/,k46vt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58123ccc594d9001ed3574b8/,58123ccc594d9001ed3574b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bfkvx/,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.2016.1174619,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bfkvx

An Analysis of Privatization and Prison Performance,"The competition thesis states that the introduction of competition from private sector service providers will spur performance improvements in previously monopolistic public sector service providers, who fear (further) delegation of their responsibilities to the private sector. This article examines the competition thesis in the context of incarceration. Using data on U.S. adult correctional facilities in 2000 and 2005, it employs a difference-in-difference strategy to compare over-time performance changes among newly competitive facilities relative to non-competitive facilities. Prison performance is measured along four dimensions (safety, order, activity, and conditions), using survey responses from prisons. The results do not show a beneficial competition effect; prisons in newly competitive states experienced performance change in ways that were statistically indistinguishable from prisons in non-competitive states. Supplemental analyses reveal this finding to be robust to most modifications to the sample and the model. A discussion considers four reasons—constitutional safeguards, professional standards, labor opposition, and non-credible threats—incarceration may be resistant to a competition effect and the implications for public policy.",TRUE,FALSE,competition|prison|privatization|public policy|punishment,2018-07-10T11:49:22.500544,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-10T11:48:58.126794,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/citation/,zmy8s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fpbfq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/relationships/node/,fpbfq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4398c64e95590011aed75e/,5b4398c64e95590011aed75e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmy8s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmy8s/,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1497524,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmy8s

The study aligns with previous research in the area by Cole and Leets (1999) that looked at attachments formed with media figures and the correlation to level of attachments in real-life relationships. In their study, Cole and Leets (1999) used a three-dimensional attachment scale that included anxious-ambivalent, avoidant, and secure, and found those with higher insecurity or unstable real-life relationships have stronger parasocial relationships. We surveyed university age respondents and we used the same scales as Cole and Leets (1999) to examine whether in Kuwait, where dating violates social norms and looser bonds are found outside of the home, that stronger parasocial relationships with media personalities will be found because of the need to fulfill relationship needs outside of family. Our hypotheses in this chapter is that higher levels of anxious-ambivalents and avoidants both will be found due to the strict collectivist nature of the society forcing many to compensate for lack of real world relationships by forming mediated bonds. Moreover, we posited and discovered that that these two groups also showed the highest levels of parasocial relationships in our sample.",TRUE,FALSE,attachment|collectivism|Kuwait|parasocial relationships|TV,2018-07-10T11:48:46.212165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-10T11:48:24.198316,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e14|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Broadcast and Video Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/citation/,w5huy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bewj5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/relationships/node/,bewj5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4381605b38c4001168538d/,5b4381605b38c4001168538d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w5huy/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w5huy

This model is used to generate hypotheses about the relationship between police stop and search/frisk and weather (temperature and precipitation) in London and New York City. After controlling for other situational factors (such as public holidays and special events) and for the frequency of street crime, increasing temperatures are associated with small increases in police stops, while precipitation (rain and snow) is associated with substantial decreases.

This disadvantage by sibship size has been observed across many different countries. We know remarkable little, however, about how sibship size disadvantage has changed over time within countries and how such trends vary between countries. Using comparative data from 114 surveys from 26 low-fertility countries, we find an increase of the sibsize disadvantage over time in the majority of countries: between the 1931-40 birth cohort and the 1971-80 birth cohort, 16 out of 26 countries showed a statistically significant increase in the sibship size disadvantage in education, while only two countries – Australia and the UK – showed a statistically measurable reduction in the sibship size disadvantage. In many countries, growing differential fertility by parental education played a substantial role in the increasing disadvantage.

Incorporating theories connecting ethnic boundaries, prejudice, and perceived threat with a tendency to justify harsher penalties, bias, or excessive force against racial minorities, we examine how Christian nationalist ideology shapes Americans’ views about police treatment of black Americans. Analyses of 2017 data from a national probability sample show that adherence to Christian nationalism predicts that Americans will be more likely to believe that police treat blacks the same as whites and that police shoot blacks more often because blacks are more violent than whites. These effects are robust even when including controls for respondents’ religious and political characteristics, indicating that Christian nationalism influences Americans’ attitudes over and above the independent influences of political conservatism or religious parochialism. In fact, we find that religiosity influences policing attitudes in the opposite direction. Moreover, observed patterns do not differ by race, suggesting that Christian nationalism provides a cultural framework that can bolster anti-black prejudice among people of color as well as whites. We argue that Christian nationalism solidifies ethnic boundaries around national identity such that Americans are less willing to acknowledge police discrimination and more likely to victim-blame, even appealing to more overtly racist notions of blacks’ purportedly violent tendencies to justify police shootings. We outline the implications of these findings for understanding the current racial-political climate leading up to and during the Trump Presidency.",TRUE,FALSE,blacks|Christian nationalism|police|policing|race|race and ethnicity|religion|sociology of religion|whites,2018-07-04T22:44:25.437550,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-04T22:43:56.239634,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/citation/,gj5zr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5swyv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/relationships/node/,5swyv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b3d2e01987be000139a8104/,5b3d2e01987be000139a8104,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5zr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gj5zr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gj5zr
