The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of dividend payments on the economic value added of companies listed in the Tehran Stock Exchange. In this research, the statistical population includes all 444 accepted companies in the stock exchange. By examining the financial statements, applying the necessary constraints and performing random sampling, 115 qualified companies were finally extracted. The Cochran formula method was used for sampling. In this study, after collecting the necessary information, the dividend and economic value added of the sample companies were calculated.

In this article, we argue that practice theory has great potential for illuminating this question. Drawing on Vincent Pouliot's empirical analysis of NATO-Russia relations after the end of the Cold War, we elaborate how change happens in and through practice. We show that post-Cold War security practices are inherently unstable, because there is a fundamental uncertainty about whether the Cold War is really over or whether the Cold War logic of bipolar confrontation still applies. Uncertainty about the meaning of the past destabilizes present practices and thus makes sudden and drastic change possible. To date, many contributions to the literature on international practices have, however, failed to grasp the inherent instability of practice. We argue that this failure is due to a particular conception of change that can be found in the works of Pierre Bourdieu. Through a close reading of Pouliot's Bourdieusian analysis of post-Cold War politics, we demonstrate the limitations of such a perspective, notably that it is unable to grasp how change originates in practice.",TRUE,FALSE,Cold War|international practices|NATO-Russia diplomacy|Pierre Bourdieu|practice theory|social change,2018-07-02T11:28:48.842450,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-11T14:57:17.517467,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d93|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Sebastian Schindler; Tobias Wille,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/citation/,7bgmn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/krs5j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/relationships/node/,krs5j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a2e69065a8b4c0010508f76/,5a2e69065a8b4c0010508f76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7bgmn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7bgmn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7bgmn,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1752971915000068

We focus on how the effects of parental divorce on children’s education differ across families with varying likelihoods of disruption. Using U.S. panel data, with careful attention to the assumptions and methods needed to estimate total and mediating causal effects, we find a significant effect of parental divorce on educational attainment among children whose parents were unlikely to divorce, for whom divorce was thus a relative shock. We find no effect among children whose parents were likely to divorce and for whom divorce was one of many disadvantages, and thus less economically and socially disruptive. We also find that the observed effect of divorce on children’s education is strongly mediated by post-divorce family income. Children’s psychosocial skills also explain a portion of the effect among children with a low propensity for parental divorce, while cognitive skills play no role in explaining the negative association between divorce and children’s education.

This paper visits the argument for using simulation as a means of addressing the gap that exists between archaeological interpretations of past behaviours and their physical residues. It is argued that simulation is used for much the same reason that archaeologists use ethnographic or experimental studies, and that computational models can help to address some of the practical limitations of these approaches to record formation.

Concerning education a misperception of academic ability can lead to educational misinvestment with potentially severe consequences. That is why this paper investigates if there are disparities in the ability to accurately self-evaluate school performance by social origin. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first paper considering this important research question. In doing so, the paper has two emphases: firstly, a theoretical model, arguing why disparities in the ability to accurately self-evaluate school performance by social origin are likely, is proposed and secondly an empirical study is conducted in order to examine if disparities by social origin are findable. The key results indicate that both students with less and students with highly educated parents underestimate their school performance if they have school grades higher than the average, and overestimate their school performance if they have school grades lower than the average.

1) Individuals, their circumstances and their interactions are heterogeneous and subject to constant change;

2) Individuals and their interactions make up groups;

3) Groups are normally very stable, lacking change.

After defining social stability and reviewing current rational choice theorizing, this paper contends that neither past nor current sociological thinking sufficiently explains how social stability can come from the arbitrariness of individual interactions. It then posits that all choices have accompanying ‘entrained' choices, subsumed to conscious decision-making, one being for ‘predictability’; a ubiquitous yet useful characteristic of sociodynamics that addresses the problem above in a testable, falsifiable way, and could be a sociological ‘constant’ for use in further research.",TRUE,FALSE,Bounded Rationality|Contract Theory|Decision Theory|Entrained Choice|Predictability|Rational Choice Models|Social Choice Models|Social Interaction Models|Social Stability|Uncertainty,2018-07-02T11:28:41.923123,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-07T02:15:18.730207,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/citation/,qxkfs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/52qc9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/relationships/node/,52qc9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a28836f3ce6c0000dcd257b/,5a28836f3ce6c0000dcd257b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qxkfs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qxkfs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qxkfs,NA

Yet, researchers have demonstrated that even samples sourced from well-respected and widely-adopted internet platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk are often unable to screen out respondents who do not meet selection criteria requested by researchers. Here, I argue that researchers should proactively verify that third-party survey data is accurately sampled before considering it for analysis. I propose using survey “attention checks” as a methodological solution for researchers to determine whether data vendors have provided low quality data. In this short research note, I illustrate the approach by analyzing data from a consequential political opinion poll administered on behalf of an academic polling center by a third-party internet panel vendor for a special election in 2017. By assessing valid/invalid response choices of two overlapping geographic variables, I identify irregularities in the dataset that suggest that the sample included respondents who were not within the researchers’ intended sampling frame. Attention checks provide a straightforward, inexpensive tool to improve the validity of research produced with internet-drawn samples.",TRUE,FALSE,Alabama Senate Race|Attention Checks|Data Vendors|Internet Poll|Political Poll|Replication|Survey Methodology,2018-07-02T11:27:29.257076,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-06T22:50:29.246298,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,Nathan Seltzer,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/citation/,93msy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hdn5y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/relationships/node/,hdn5y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a28167570a91c000f1c7c33/,5a28167570a91c000f1c7c33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93msy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93msy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93msy,NA

However, existing research offers different expectations about whether personal ties prove detrimental or beneficial for lenders. Research on embeddedness from economic sociology highlights the advantages lenders accrue when they develop personal ties with borrowers, including enhanced trust, information-sharing and greater social control. Yet research from social psychology offers reason to suspect that personal relationships can be costly because lenders who feel personally tied to borrowers run the risk of escalating commitment to poor performers. Drawing on these lines of research, this study uses data from a Latin American microfinance bank to ask: When are personal relationships detrimental or beneficial for financial intermediaries? It shows that, when lenders and borrowers have personal relationships, lenders are less likely to cut ties with poor performers and borrowers miss fewer payments, consistent with expectations from both literatures. However, these trends vary with frequency of contact. When lenders and borrowers interact less frequently, lenders continue to show heightened commitment, but borrowers become less compliant, creating potential problems for lenders. Overall, this study integrates theories from economic sociology and social psychology to offer a more balanced, temporally-informed understanding of personal ties in finance.",TRUE,FALSE,embeddedness|escalation of commitment|finance|lending|microfinance|relationships,2018-07-02T11:27:28.946103,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-06T13:26:34.173504,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/citation/,edt8g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b2vmh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/relationships/node/,b2vmh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a27e1d170a91c000f1c51e9/,5a27e1d170a91c000f1c51e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/edt8g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/edt8g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/edt8g,NA
