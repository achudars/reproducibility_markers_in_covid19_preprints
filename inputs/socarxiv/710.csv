In this paper, we chart the smart city ecosystem in Dublin, Ireland, and examine how the four city authorities have actively collaborated to progressively frame and mobilise an articulated vision of Dublin as a smart city. In particular, we focus on the work of ‘Smart Dublin’, a shared unit established to coordinate, manage and promote Dublin’s smart city initiatives. We argue that Smart Dublin has on the one hand sought to corral smart city initiatives within a common framework, and on the other has acted to boost the city-region’s smart city activities, especially with respect to economic development.

One of the challenges researchers face in this area, however, is balancing the trade-offs between different modes of network measurement and study design.  At one end of the spectrum, entirely ego-centered network designs facilitate access to a large, generalizable sample of the population but often lack details on the underlying network structure that embed each respondent.  At the other end, whole-network designs offer fine details about the network structure but are costly and suffer from generalizability limitations.  In this paper, we employ an ego-centered network sampling design that strikes a balance between these two cases by leveraging how individuals perceive their social worlds vis-a-vis respondent reports of their alter-alter ties.  We describe a large sample of close personal networks where respondents informed on their perceptions of the ties between their alters on multiple types of relations.  Specifically, we characterize the distribution of network statistics (size, density, and multiplexity) for over a thousand individual ego-centered cognitive networks drawn from a representative sample of the U.S. population.  To our knowledge this is the first study to characterize the distribution of mental maps vis-a-vis perceived alter-alter relationships in this large of a sample of respondents involved in close personal networks.  In doing so, we more clearly shed light on how Americans perceive the structure of their social worlds and provide an empirical case study in what we characterize as ego-centered cognitive social structures.",TRUE,FALSE,networks|personal networks|socarxiv|social networks,2018-07-02T10:56:49.980339,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-08T20:07:48.053083,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/citation/,pg3yx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4ugk6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/relationships/node/,4ugk6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5910cd926c613b024e488951/,5910cd926c613b024e488951,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pg3yx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pg3yx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pg3yx,NA

Consequently, to identify as “neither religious nor spiritual” runs the risk of being stigmatized as superficial, untrustworthy, and immoral. Conflicts and confusions encountered in the process of negotiating a nonreligious/nonspiritual identity, caused by the ambiguous nature of religious language, were explored through qualitative interviews with 14 ex-ministers and 1 atheist minister—individuals for whom supernaturalist religion had formed the central core of identity, but who have deconverted and no longer hold supernatural beliefs. The cognitive linguistics approach of Frame Semantics was applied to the process of “oppositional identity work” to examine why certain identity labels are avoided or embraced due to considerations of the cognitive frames evoked by those labels.

Through the constant comparative method of grounded theory, a host of useful theoretical concepts emerged from the data. Several impediments to the construction of a “secular but not superficial” identity were identified, and a framework of new theoretical concepts developed to make sense of them: sense disparity, frame disparity, identity misfire, foiled identity, sense conflation, and conflated frames. Several consequences arising from these impediments were explored: (1) consequences of sense conflation and conflated frames for the study of religion; (2) consequences of conflated frames for religious terminology; and (3) consequences of the negation of conflated frames for those who identify as not religious, not spiritual, or not Christian. Additionally, four types of oppositional identity work were identified and analyzed: (1) avoidance identity work, (2) dissonant identity work, (3) adaptive identity work, and (4) alternative identity work. Finally, the concept of conflated frames was applied to suggest a new interpretation of the classic Weberian disenchantment narrative.",TRUE,FALSE,Atheism|Ex-Clergy|Humanism|Nonreligion|Secularism|Sociology of Religion|Spirituality,2018-07-02T10:56:48.994262,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-05T22:41:01.607832,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/citation/,bxszm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vxwrf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/relationships/node/,vxwrf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/590cfde36c613b024e47cbbc/,590cfde36c613b024e47cbbc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxszm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bxszm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bxszm,NA

I expand this view by showing that one linguistic feature of “Pittsburghese” is used to create stances that are enregistered along with the characterological figures in this vernacular variety of English. Falling question intonation (FQI) is a common feature of the White Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania variety. I analyze its use in a series of videos posted on YouTube® entitled Greg and Donny. The series depicts conversations among the two eponymous characters and their friends in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. LQI is used by them to take stances that serve to mock the addressee while simultaneously aligning with them, a stance that is typical of working class Pittsburghers.

We developed a novel method to assess long term retention as a measure of true learning in tests that do not involve any cramming and found to our dismay that it falls progressively more towards recent years. Our initial work on poverty showed that consumption on commodities is hyperbolic (as in catalysis) and hierarchic and, that the total income is not fractionally distributed among the commodities, as economists assume;  the leftover (residual) income after the more essential items is spent on the commodities of lesser preference. Education is also a naturally ordered commodity and parental income quantitatively determined school dropouts/attendance obeying the same hyperbolic relationship, as we could show. We could thereby affirm the first-ever mechanism for Engels’ three curves of consumption, based on the time constants associated with the corresponding hyperbolic functions.  The disturbing observation was that long term retention as a true measure of learning decreases rapidly with years and seems to be independent of socioeconomic circumstances and gender but depends on subjects. The test also revealed that those who are not good at cramming could exhibit good retention, though the conventional tests fail to identify them. Causes of the progressive loss of retention for the recent years, either as limits to learning or as limitations in imparting learning, need to be assessed by further studies. This would hopefully begin an era of inclusive education for a just society for which methodology beyond pious intentions never existed.",TRUE,FALSE,commodities|cramming|dropouts|Econometrics|Examinations|hierarchy of consumption|hyperbolic function|income|retention|rote learning|Social justice|STEM Education|true learning,2018-07-02T10:56:45.823521,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-03T09:55:59.986655,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d79|Education|Education Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics",V.
