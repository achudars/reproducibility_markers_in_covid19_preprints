adheres closely to positivism and formulates lengthy lists of abstract
propositions and predictions (Collins, Turner, Kemper, etc.). In contrast,
the other group’s epistemology is enmeshed in interpretivism and produces
thick-descriptions of emotion labels, scripts, and understandings
(Hochschild, Katz, Wetherell, etc.). Neither positivist nor interpretivist
approaches adequately theorize the causal and conjunctural status of human
emotions in social-historical sequences; thus, they both fail to show how,
why, and when accounts of emotional states may be necessary in social
explanations. Critical realism (CR) offers a better way to conceptualize
the influence of the psychophysiological subsistence of emotion within
social interactions. A CR-inspired approach to the sociology of emotion
should include three insights: (1) *Emotions as Evolved Capabilities:* From
our evolutionary prehistory, humans have inherited distinctive emotional
capabilities, including a complex palette of emotional experience and
impressive emotional mechanisms for rapid-fire sublinguistic communication.
(2) *Emotions as Emergent Causal Powers:* Human emotions are themselves
‘emergent’ neurophenomenological entities belonging to the
microsociological domain of ontology. Emotional experiences emerge from but
are not reducible to labels, bodies, gestures, minds, social situations,
scripts, etc. Integrating these multicomponent ingredients, the
psychophysiological coherence of emotions indicates the existence of
emergent properties, including possibilities of upward and downward
causation. (3) *Emotions as Situational Dispositions*: Emotions realize
their causal power as psychological dispositions to action, inaction, and
communication. By embracing critical realism, sociologists can avoid both
an upward conflation of emotion into higher-level social structures, like
language (an error of the interpretivists), as well as a downward reduction
of the psychology of social emotion to neurobiology or behavioralism (an
error of the positivists).",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:08.852249,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-18T04:01:58.336000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/citation/,fxha2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m25ch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/relationships/node/,m25ch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57b533376c613b01de53d8e1/,57b533376c613b01de53d8e1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxha2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxha2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxha2,NA

In contrast to those that seek to realise the benefits of a smart city vision, a number of critics have highlighted a number of shortcomings, challenges and risks with such endeavours.  This short paper outlines a third path, one that aims to realise the benefits of smart city initiatives while recasting the thinking and ethos underpinning them and addressing their deficiencies and limitations.  It argues that smart city thinking and initiatives need to be reframed, reimagined and remade in six ways.  Three of these concern normative and conceptual thinking with regards to goals, cities and epistemology, and three concern more practical and political thinking and praxes with regards to management/governance, ethics and security, and stakeholders and working relationships.

However, the ACP also created the possibility for a kind of deliberation that can occur only through mass communication.1The news coverage of the ACP had the potential to spark a mediated deliberation-a process whereby newspapers, online news outlets, and other media help the wider public understand and think through issues in at least a quasi-deliberative way. In our view, projects like the ACP succeed or fail not only based on their internal quality but also depending on how they engage the larger media and, ultimately, the broader public. This essay presents a particular aspect of this larger public engagement, which we call ""mediated meta-deliberation."" In simple terms, a meta-deliberation involves deliberation about deliberation, or how we talk about how this special kind of talk. In the context of this chapter, we focus specifically on how the media do this, hence the term mediated meta-deliberation. In the sections that follow, we explain why organizers of deliberative initiatives should care about the mediated meta-deliberation that occurs regarding their activities.

While much of the research on news frames has focused on their identification and effects, less work has investigated the specific contributions these different frames make to democratic life. Value judgments about distinct news frames are often not generated in a systematic fashion, not grounded in democratic theory, and/or not supported by empirical evidence. In this article, we address these problems by arguing for and extending normative assessment as a standard operating procedure to determine the democratic value of political communication phenomena. We demonstrate the usefulness of normative assessment by showing how two important generic news frames (politics as a strategic game and as a substantive contestation) contribute to a deliberative public discourse prior to a general election. Using data on television news coverage of the German federal election campaign in 2009, we investigate how these frames are related to the inclusiveness and civility of public discourse and the extent to which it features exchanges of substantive reasons for political positions. Results show that mediated democratic deliberation suffers consistently from strategic game framing, while contestation frames make ambivalent contributions.

Yet, the detrimental effects of this trend have been more assumed than demonstrated. This study examines one consequence of sound-bite journalism: the creation of incomplete argument, in which speakers presenting their political position in the news do not also justify it. Drawing on data about television news in Germany, Russia, and the United States, it shows that shrinking sound bites consistently reduce the probability of opinion justification across widely differing national contexts. Sound-bite journalism emerges as harmful to television news' ability to produce public justification.",TRUE,FALSE,communication|deliberation|journalism|political communication|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:08.629949,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-15T15:18:07.303000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/citation/,2n8ba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jbzqy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/relationships/node/,jbzqy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57b1dd309ad5a101f6d85c96/,57b1dd309ad5a101f6d85c96,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2n8ba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2n8ba/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2n8ba,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcom.12246

networks external to movements that provide supports to social
movements—but comparative work is required to understand divergences in the
strength of institutional infrastructures in similar movements across
national borders. I conduct a historical, comparative analysis of the
religious right in Canada and the United States using secondary sources. I
examine the historical process of institution building in conservative,
evangelical Christian communities from 1920-1950. I show that the large,
dense network of para-church organizations established by conservative,
evangelical Christians in the United States was not similarly established
in Canada. I identify two historical factors in this critical juncture: the
role of denominations and bureaucratic regulation of broadcast radio. I
argue that this critical juncture produced divergences in institution
building that, decades later, affected the supports available to the
religious right movements in these countries. *",TRUE,FALSE,ASA2016|ASA2016.403|socarxiv|working paper,2018-07-02T10:48:23.918491,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-15T15:07:59.452000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/citation/,b9n5p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/27fdw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/relationships/node/,27fdw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57b1dad39ad5a101f4d85c01/,57b1dad39ad5a101f4d85c01,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9n5p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b9n5p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b9n5p,NA
