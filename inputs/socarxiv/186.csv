The UN-Habitat's publication of a Response Plan for mollification of the SARS-CoV-2 based externalities in the cities of the world testifies to that. This article takes the UN-Habitat report as the premise to carry out an empirical investigation in the four major metro cities of India. The report's concern with the urban character of the pandemic has underlined the role of cities in disease transmission. In that wake, the study demarcates factors at the sub-city level that tend to jeopardize the two mandatory precautionary measures during COVID-19 – Social Distancing and Lockdown. It investigates those factors through a Covid Vulnerability Index. The Index devised with the help of Analytic Hierarchy Process demarcates the low, moderate, high, and very high vulnerable city sub-units. Secondly, UN- Habitat's one of the major action areas is evidence-based knowledge creation through mapping and its analysis. In our study, we do it at a granular scale for arriving at a more nuanced understanding. Thus, in harmony with the UN-habitat's we take the urban seriously and identify the gaps that need to be plugged for the pandemic cities of now and of the future.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Covid Vulnerability Index|Lockdown|Metro Cities|Social Distancing|UN-Habitat,2020-06-02T05:13:11.780785,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-02T05:12:40.651315,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/citation/,523r8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed5c400aeeb6d044e08464b/,5ed5c400aeeb6d044e08464b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/523r8/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102230,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/523r8

Previous research has shown that negative shocks impair cognitive function and change risk, time and social preferences. In this study, we analyze the results of a longitudinal multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N=1,652), Spain (N=1,660) and the United Kingdom (N=1,578). We measure cognitive function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits using an experimentally validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in preferences.
Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity).

In India, the other-gender community encompasses persons with a variety of gender identities, forming a culturally unique gender group. Although they have always remained an integral part of the society from the very ancient time, unfortunately, their existence is grappling with abject poverty, illiteracy, hatred, and mockery. Such stigmatisation and segregation from society have left them to compromise with the employment opportunities available. It is important to identify the gap between the other-gender population and the general population in the field of literacy and workforce participation. This paper uses the data on other-gender published by the Census of India for the first time. According to the Indian Census 2011, there is around 4.9 lakh other-gender population in the country.

One of the most promising directions for reducing stigma lies in Allport’s (1954) theory of intergroup contact, suggesting that social interactions with people with mental illness invalidate negative stereotypes, decrease fear and anxiety, and enable perspective-taking and empathy. While the empirical literature is largely supportive of the contact hypothesis, social network theory indicates that the degree to which contact reduces stigma should depend on the nature, magnitude, and valence of exposure to people with mental illness. We address this question using data from the National Stigma Study – Replication II (NSS-R II), fielded on a special module of the 2018 General Social Survey (N=1,179). We find that simply knowing someone with mental illness, or even the number of people one knows, explains little about the public’s desire for social distance, endorsement of coercion, or perceptions of dangerousness. However, having stronger relationships with more people with mental illness, and having more friends and family (but not more peripheral ties) with mental illness, are associated with reductions in stigma. In contrast, exposure to more dangerousness or violence among people in the network with mental illness is associated with greater levels of stigma, while contact with more people who are in treatment for mental illness (as opposed to untreated) is linked to less stigma.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-01T18:51:55.293887,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-01T18:15:28.161836,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/citation/,e9c27,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed53f95aeeb6d043c087c2e/,5ed53f95aeeb6d043c087c2e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9c27/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e9c27/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e9c27

Traditional tracing methods might however miss a number of contacts between infected and susceptible persons. Digital contact tracing apps have been developed to assist health departments in notifying individuals of recent exposures to SARS-CoV-2. These apps are used in several countries throughout the world, and some US states have either launched or are planning to launch such apps. The potential effects of digital contact tracing apps depend however on their widespread adoption. Most investigations of the determinants of adoption among potential users have focused on issues related to privacy features (e.g., who can access data, whether location is recorded) and the accuracy of the app in notifying users of exposures to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., false notifications). In this paper, we investigate whether financial incentives might help further accelerate the adoption of digital contact tracing apps. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with an online sample of 394 US residents aged 18–69 years old. We asked participants to make a series of choices between two hypothetical versions of a digital contact tracing app characterized by several randomly selected attributes, including varying levels of financial cost or incentives to download. In this experiment, financial incentives were more than twice as important in the decision-making process about DCT app downloads than privacy and accuracy. In order to accelerate adoption, US States planning to launch digital contact tracing apps should consider offering financial incentives for download to potential users.",TRUE,FALSE,Contact tracing|Coronavirus|COVID-19|Digital apps|Discrete choice experiment|Financial incentives|Innovation in healthcare|Stated preferences,2020-06-01T18:51:43.368508,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-01T18:11:40.350186,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/citation/,9vp7x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed486adc7568603ce2d2e17/,5ed486adc7568603ce2d2e17,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9vp7x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9vp7x

The adequate generalization of ‘measurement’ is discussed to involve the discrepancy, due to the fundamental Planck constant, between any quantum coherent state and its statistical representation as a statistical ensemble after measurement.
A set-theory corollary is the curious invariance to the axiom of choice: Any coherent state excludes any well-ordering and thus excludes also the axiom of choice. It should be equated to a well-ordered set after measurement and thus requires the axiom of choice.
Quantum invariance underlies quantum information and reveals it as the relation of an unordered quantum “much” (i.e. a coherent state) and a well-ordered “many” of the measured results (i.e. a statistical ensemble). It opens up to a new horizon, in which all physical processes and phenomena can be interpreted as quantum computations realizing relevant operations and algorithms on quantum information. All phenomena of entanglement can be described in terms of the so defined quantum information.
Quantum invariance elucidates the link between general relativity and quantum mechanics and thus, the problem of quantum gravity.",TRUE,FALSE,axiom of choice|choice|coherent state|measurement in quantum mechanics|well-ordering,2020-06-01T18:51:49.820487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-01T18:12:19.873029,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/citation/,c67jd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed4817daeeb6d03fe08552a/,5ed4817daeeb6d03fe08552a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67jd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c67jd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c67jd
