waste in Romania and still prevails in current waste management options.
This type of critical infrastructure was designed to dispose urban waste
generated over years or even decades and ultimately led to creating new
landforms in the urban landscape. On the other hand, these sites are major
sources of complex pollution unfulfilling EU regulations, being scheduled
to be closed. This paper aims to analyze landfills as anthropogenic
landforms by applying GIS techniques emphasizing them in a geographical
context and not only in situ. The location of these sites usually on
alluvial plains of rivers leading to positive landforms that may change
hydrogeomorphology dynamics or to be exposed to the floods. The other side,
their location in hilly or mountainous regions increase vulnerability to
other geomorphological process (gully erosion, landslide). Also, the
extension of human settlements and land use is influenced by the presence
of such a site either it is closed. The implications of these landforms are
varied and must be
linked to geographical realities from around. Thus, the mapping of these
anthropogenic landforms contribute to a better understanding of the
systemic interactions from the local environment. This approach may be an
important tool for EIA studies, in the process of rehabilitation,
