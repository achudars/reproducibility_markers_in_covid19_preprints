Yet, previous studies are limited either by the way in which they measure family background or by the detail level by which they measure educational attainment. To address these two limitations, we develop a novel approach based on sibling similarities in labor market outcomes. Applying the approach to data on all Danes born 1965–1971, we examine the direct effect––other than through extremely granular education measures––of all combined effects of family background on occupational and income destinations. Our analyses show that the extremely fine-grained education measures can account for more than 90 percent of the total family background effect on occupational destinations, leaving little room for the processes associated with the direct effects of social origins to operate. For income destinations, however, the extremely fine-grained education measure accounts for merely three-quarters of the total family background effect. Roughly half of this direct effect on income destinations can be explained by sibling similarities in occupational choice, suggesting that family background affects income destinations through processes that operates equally within and between occupations. We discuss different mechanisms that may account for these results.",TRUE,FALSE,meritocratic|mobility|siblings,2020-03-06T11:07:23.343142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T11:07:02.398224,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/citation/,7w5m9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e62044fa0964501c805596b/,5e62044fa0964501c805596b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w5m9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7w5m9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7w5m9,NA

Each of these changes may influence children’s nutritional status, which is sensitive to food availability, access, and utilization, and which may have lasting consequences for later-life health and socioeconomic outcomes. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on climate and child health by studying the effects of temperature and precipitation exposures on children’s height and weight in Indonesia. Drawing on five rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) implemented between 1993 and 2015, we estimate fixed-effects regression models of height-for-age (HFA) and weight-for-height (WFH) among samples of children ages 24-59 months and 0-23 months, respectively. We test for heterogeneity in these effects across sub-populations expected to vary in their vulnerability. Results show that delays in monsoon onset are consistently associated with worse child health outcomes. Delays in monsoon onset during the prenatal period are associated with reduced child height among children age 2-4 years, and these effects are concentrated among males. The weight of young (&lt;2 years) children is adversely affected by delays in the most recent monsoon season, and this relationship is particularly strong among residents of Java.

Since the establishment of the National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) in 2008, the Vietnamese scientific community had adapted to new international standards in 2014 and 2017, which resulted in different productivity between social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines. Therefore, to understand the effects of new research policies, this study deploys Bayesian analysis on a comprehensive dataset of 1,564 Vietnamese authors in the 2008-2018 period. The dataset was extracted from the exclusively designed Social Sciences Humanities Peer Award (SSHPA) database (http://sshpa.com/). Various factors are considered in the data collecting process, including age, gender, new authors in a year, leading authors, co- authorship, and journal’s Impact Factor (JIF). The findings indicate three main characteristics of the Vietnamese SSH community after the research policy application. First, in terms of output, Economics is the dominant field relative to other SSH’s disciplines in Vietnam. It has contributed 858 publications in 12 years, about two times as much as the total output of Education, the second place. Economics also experiences a high level of contribution from authors at the age of 40-44 and nearly 500 new authors within the period. Secondly, despite a rapid rise in the number of lead authors, gender disparity among disciplines is a critical issue. Male researchers outnumber female ones in Economics and Social medicine, with Education being the sole exception. Lastly, authors in Education appears to have less international collaboration than those in Social medicine, Economics, and other fields. The success of Economics could be a reference point for other SSH disciplines to increase their research output. These findings enable a better understanding of SSH research policy application and call for a more suitable policy to support female academics in a number of SSH fields.",TRUE,FALSE,research policy application|scientific productivity|social medicine|Social sciences and humanities|SSHPA database,2020-03-06T11:04:40.856085,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T11:04:19.574299,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/citation/,kd9gh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6134f2a09645014905207e/,5e6134f2a09645014905207e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kd9gh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kd9gh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kd9gh,NA

In this study, we critically appraise the intersections and differences between the two movements. Based on our thematic comparison here, we conclude several key things. First, there is substantial scope for new communities of practice to form within scholarly communities that place sharing and collaboration/open participation at their focus. Second, Both the principles and practices of FOSS can be more deeply ingrained within scholarship, asserting a balance between pragmatism and social ideology. Third, at the present, Open Scholarship risks being subverted and compromised by commercial players. Fourth, the shift and acceleration towards a system of Open Scholarship will be greatly enhanced by a concurrent shift in recognising a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer review and research articles. In order to achieve this, we propose the formulation of a new type of institutional mandate. We believe that there is substantial need for research funders to invest in sustainable open scholarly infrastructure, and the communities that support them, to avoid the capture and enclosure of key research services that would prevent optimal researcher behaviours. Such a shift could ultimately lead to a healthier scientific culture, and a system where competition is replaced by collaboration, resources (including time and people) are shared and acknowledged more efficiently, and the research becomes inherently more rigorous, verified, and reproducible.",TRUE,FALSE,Collaboration|Communities|FLOSS|FOSS|Freedom|Free Software|Open Access|Open Data|Open Research|Open Research Practices|Open Scholarship|Open Science|Open Source|Replicability|Reproducibility|Scholarly Communication|Scholarly Publishing|Sharing,2020-03-06T04:50:08.092196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-06T04:49:36.475054,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/citation/,2kxq8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8buvz/,8buvz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e608c770f987d00fa495209/,5e608c770f987d00fa495209,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2kxq8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2kxq8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2kxq8,NA

Overall 22% of research was available to non-subscribers, about half that found in other disciplines, even though authors had the right to make articles open without payment in at least 95% of cases. Open access was even less common in many leading journals and among researchers in the United States.

Latent class analyses characterized each school’s predominant health lifestyles based on several health behavior domains. School-specific stochastic actor-based models (SABMs) evaluated the bidirectional relationship between friendship networks and health lifestyles.

Whether the findings from these studies are applicable to countries with legal, religious, and cultural contexts regarding sexual and gender minorities distinct from Western societies is yet to be explored. To fill this gap, this paper summarizes the findings from focus groups and a pilot survey conducted to develop SOGI questions in the Japanese context. For sexual orientation identity, a six-category question that includes definition of each category, and for transgender status, a three-step method, are suggested for general use. The paper also reports on percentage distributions of SOGI by assigned sex at birth and by age group based on the Osaka City Residents' Survey, one of the first population-based surveys in Japan with SOGI questions.

After a slight decline in 2014 to 69.2 percent, the response rate fell abruptly to 61.3 percent in 2016.  In 2018, it fell again, but by a more modest amount to 59.5 percent.  The reasons for the recent declines are not fully understood, and research with auxiliary data and other surveys may be able to provide additional clarity in the future.  In the meantime, I offer this report to promote transparency and reassurance.  On the one hand, the GSS is fighting the same non-response headwind that other national surveys confront, and thus there is reason to be concerned.  On the other hand, the problem is not so acute that a decline in the demographic representativeness of the GSS is yet apparent.  This overall conclusion is based on a comparison of the realized demographic demographic composition of the GSS and the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) from 2012 through 2018.",TRUE,FALSE,General Social Survey|Public opinion|Response rate|Social change|Survey,2020-03-03T18:57:45.831415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-03T18:33:56.802991,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/citation/,7q58d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5e882886b40d00d8d04c19/,5e5e882886b40d00d8d04c19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7q58d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7q58d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7q58d,NA

Although both concepts are theoretically related, to date they have not been analyzed together. In this study, we identify their theoretical underpinnings and determine how they can be measured empirically. We analyze how listening to music causes nostalgia and melancholia, and whether both experiences are related to different behavioral intentions. To this end, we conducted an online experiment with 359 participants who listened to music they considered either nostalgic, melancholic, or neutral. Afterward, participants answered 122 items related to nostalgia and melancholia. Using Structural Equation Modeling, and more specifically Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes Modeling, we first developed two new scales, the Formative Nostalgia Scale and the Formative Melancholia Scale. Both scales consist of five items each. Results showed that listening to music indeed increased nostalgia and melancholia. Although considerably different, both concepts are related nonetheless: Listening to nostalgic music increases melancholia, whereas listening to melancholic music does not increase nostalgia. In addition, both experiences are related to different behavioral intentions: Whereas experiencing nostalgia was associated with a stronger intention to share the music and listen to it again, experiencing melancholia revealed the exact opposite relation.",TRUE,FALSE,media effects|melancholia|music|nostalgia|online experiment|scale development,2020-03-03T18:57:36.664614,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-03T18:26:08.849365,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/citation/,dt7v8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5e525186b40d00b3d03f1c/,5e5e525186b40d00b3d03f1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dt7v8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dt7v8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dt7v8,NA
