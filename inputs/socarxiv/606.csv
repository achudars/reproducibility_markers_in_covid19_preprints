The current study tries to evaluate the textbook SUNRISE 9 based on six categories. This study intends to cover how those categories are represented in SUNRISE 9. The categories are the layout and design, activities, skills, language type, subject and content and conclusion. The present study aims at answering the questions about SUNRISE 9 from teachers’ and students’ opinions and finding out whether there is a statistically significant difference between the teachers’ and students’ responses with regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the textbook which are used in language classrooms in all basic schools in the Northern Iraq. Two data collection tools were carried out in the current study. The quantitative data were obtained using questionnaire for teachers and students with a total number of 375 9th grade students and 40 9th grade teachers. They were chosen randomly from Sulaimanyah city in the North of Iraq. The qualitative part of the study, semi-structured interviews were held among 13 teachers to gather more neccessary data. The findings reveal that the teacher participants have negative opinions towards most of the sections of the textbook and some others have not stated any opinions but the student participants generally have positive opinions about SUNRISE 9. For this English textbook SUNRISE 9, an empirical evaluative study and an in-depth method evaluation are also suggested to be conducted to find out more important results.",TRUE,FALSE,evaluation|material|material evaluation|textbook|textbook evaluation,2018-07-02T13:32:11.843300,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:39:42.041725,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/citation/,s98b5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kqfhu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/relationships/node/,kqfhu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc5714266c2a0010c0e3ad/,5abc5714266c2a0010c0e3ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s98b5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s98b5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.27,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s98b5

As such, the current study content analyzed the first and the second stage secondary English as a foreign language (EFL) textbooks taught at public schools in Jordan. This descriptive analytical research design was carried out to explore the means and frequencies of text structure types included in both textbooks and the extent of fairness in presenting these structures within the reading texts of both textbooks. The main aim of the study is to provide insights for both EFL teachers and book designers to expose students to varied types of text structure. A content analysis sheet for coding the material based on the criterion of inclusion was used. The reading passage was the unit of analysis. The analysis of the study revealed that the Jordanian secondary stage textbooks include a variety of text structure types that are not fairly distributed; nevertheless, the descriptive structure was the most frequent structure in both textbooks. Starting from this premise, the current study discussed the pedagogical implications of text structure teaching.

Although the domain of refusal strategies is one of the very important domains in the pragmatic aspect in English, none of the studies conducted about the English language in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have studied refusal strategies used by people in this region. This study aims to investigate the strategies that different people in Dubai use to refuse promotions by sales assistants in different shopping malls in Dubai. The data in this study was collected during field observations conducted in two shopping malls in Dubai.  The findings in this study show that most participants chose to refuse the promotions non-verbally. They used different refusal strategies such as avoidance, hand gestures, and nodding their heads. Only two verbal refusal expressions were used. The reasons for these findings might be related to different factors such as the different cultural backgrounds of the participants, the level of English proficiency, and the nature of promotions as imposition on people’s privacy. Therefore, in order to enable second language learners to use refusal strategies politely and effectively, English teachers should introduce the different strategies that people might use to refuse offers or suggestions in English.",TRUE,FALSE,English language|refusal strategies|verbal refusals,2018-07-02T13:32:11.676989,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:40:54.692733,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/citation/,jcwt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dwc92/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/relationships/node/,dwc92,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc532fa2409b00119deb33/,5abc532fa2409b00119deb33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jcwt5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.23,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jcwt5

Teacher Talk (TT) is one of the areas of teaching and learning which is often neglected in classroom research even with its high importance in student learning. Identifying the literature gap on TT in specific sociocultural contexts, this study aims to investigate different types of f-moves in Teacher Talk and their impact on developing students’ dialogic skills in English as Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms in Saudi Arabia. The IRF sequence (initiation, response, feedback or F-move) is considered a common sequence of TT in Saudi EFL classrooms. This study uses Cullen’s (2002) analytical framework which focuses on the third sequence of the IRF and Vygotsky’s (1978) sociocultural theory to explore the emerging themes of TT in Saudi Arabian secondary classrooms. The methodology of the study is a qualitative case study, and the participants of the study are 18 secondary school teachers all share Arabic as their first language. The data was collected through classroom observation, audio-recording of forty-five-minute classroom lessons, and semi-structured teacher interviews. The analysis focused on the discoursal and evaluative role of F-Move. The data analysis shows three F-Move types 1) F-Move Repetition Discoursal 2) F-Move Evaluative 3) F-Move Elaborative Discoursal. The findings point out that these F-Moves may increase student-teacher interaction, identification, and correction of errors, and maintain and guide dialogic conversation/interaction between teacher and students if it is correctly oriented. The data analysis shows examples in which TT promotes students’ involvement and increases their dialogic skills while, on the other hand, when TT reduces students’ potential to participate and consequently reduces the students’ spoken output.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T13:32:11.637840,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:41:06.164335,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/citation/,hk7ct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pd6ya/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/relationships/node/,pd6ya,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc51ed266c2a000ec0f0bd/,5abc51ed266c2a000ec0f0bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hk7ct/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hk7ct

It is mainly connected with the non-homogeneity of the inference action and a huge spectrum of its occurrence in language and speech. The study focuses on the search for the universal and relative to the nature of inference criteria of the classification of inferences in language and speech to penetrate deep into the essence of the discussed phenomenon. In this regard, the paper presents an analysis and discussion of the existing inference classifications on the basis of such criteria as functionality, a vector of action, a level of cognitive procession, inferential relations, etc. The aim of the analysis is to compare the current classifications of inferences, to make a conclusion about possible vectors of the inference actions in language and speech and to find out the universal, cognitive foundation underlying inference occurrences. Taking into account the nature of inference as a way of human thinking, the types of inferences are identified according to such mental operations as comparison, filling in (framing), integration, elimination, deduction, induction on the material of various linguistic resources (texts, utterances, dialogues). The proposed classification requires further consideration on the basis of a broader linguistic material (various types of discourse, utterances involving polysemantic words or phraseological units; the study of nomination processes of complex linguistic units like idioms, derived verbs, compound nouns) and can be modified and complemented.",TRUE,FALSE,classification of inferences|cognitive operations|discourse|situational context,2018-07-02T13:32:11.602205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:41:25.173699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/citation/,u9y3s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2bnxq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/relationships/node/,2bnxq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc5010a2409b00109de52b/,5abc5010a2409b00109de52b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9y3s/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9y3s

To generate data for this empirical study, a 5-point strongly agree to strongly disagree Likert-scale questionnaire has been adapted and standardized steps were followed to ensure the reliability and validity of the instrument. Arabic version of the questionnaire was administered to randomly selected male and female Saudi English-major university undergraduates studying at foreign languages department during their regular teaching session to generate data. Descriptive analyses were run to calculate percentages, means and standard deviation. The results inform that the participants of this study prefer to use cognitive strategies the most followed by metacognitive strategies. Socio-affective strategies were reported to be used the least by this group. This trend offers valuable insights into the fact that Saudi English as a foreign language (EFL) learners resort to bottom-up strategies more frequently as compared to the top-down ones. It is recommended that Saudi EFL learners should be made aware of the significance of these strategies to enhance their listening comprehension. English language teachers should provide their students with appropriate skills of how to listen, retrospect on listening process and concentrate on practicing metacognitive and socio-affective strategies during their listening tasks.

Writing in a second or foreign language is undeniably more difficult than writing in the first language. Therefore, it is imperative for teachers to understand that there are many differences between first language (L1) and second language (L2) writing. Second language writing is complexified by the addition of new resources and norms (new structural elements of the new language, new rhetorical conventions, and some other things). On that ground, teachers should select the most appropriate teaching methods and strategies in their writing classes, one strategy that teachers can apply in their academic writing class is Reading to Learn strategy. This study presented information on a teaching strategy named Reading to Learn applied to one group of Academic Writing class. One group was taught using Reading to Learn teaching strategy, with the hope of helping students improve in both their reading and writing skills. This study was conducted in a writing course consisting of 20 students. Academic Writing is the highest writing class before students go to thesis proposal writing at the English Department of UKSW Indonesia. One central question to be answered is: How effective is Reading to Learn strategy when it is used to teach Academic Writing students? Instruments used were pre-test, post-test, direct as well as video-recorded observations, weekly journals, and interviews. In Indonesia, not many studies dealing with Reading to Learn have been done. One study was conducted by Samanhudi and Sugiarti (2013). This study reports the effectiveness of using Reading to Learn program in teaching critical writing to teacher candidates in English Language Teaching Department, Sampoerna School of Education, Jakarta. From the statistical analysis as well as from students’ perceptions, several conclusions can be drawn. First, Reading to Learn is effective to teach Academic Writing. Secondly, not all tertiary students like working cooperatively. Some prefer working individually. The next conclusion is students perceive peer review as an important part of their essay writing.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic writing course|effective; Reading to Learn|writing competence,2018-07-02T13:32:11.525041,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:41:42.388719,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/citation/,zwm9u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bzq96/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/relationships/node/,bzq96,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4e69a2409b000f9df8ca/,5abc4e69a2409b000f9df8ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zwm9u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zwm9u/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zwm9u

The language of literature is rich with social context, exquisite deviant forms, and vocabulary. This paper aims at examining to what extent pedagogical stylistics can be helpful in increasing students' literary awareness. In addition, to examine how it can help them to interpret and analyze selected poems that have been chosen for them to achieve this goal. For the purpose of gathering the required data a pre-test and a post-test are conducted.  Verdonk's (2013) approach is adopted in teaching stylistic tools to the students. The participants were (40) second-year students of the academic year 2018-2017 from University of Baghdad, Iraq. Moreover, a questionnaire is distributed to know students' opinions about studying stylistics. The final results proved that (1-) pedagogical stylistics tools are of great significance to pay heed to the language of poetry or literary language in general, (2-)the questionnaire shows that most agreed on studying stylistics in the classroom. Thus, this study highly recommends that teachers of literary subjects should focus on stylistic tools in teaching literary texts.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL Iraqi students|literary awareness|pedagogical stylistics|poetry,2018-07-02T13:32:11.489568,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:43:09.691626,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/citation/,yfpg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tjcws/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/relationships/node/,tjcws,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4d25266c2a000ec0ed67/,5abc4d25266c2a000ec0ed67,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfpg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yfpg2/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.18,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yfpg2
