We argue that the authors undersell the importance of their findings, especially considering shifts in the content and ubiquitousness of mass media. Advances in communication technologies have enabled a new era of objectification, marked by an increasing presence and acceptance of sexual objectification in media, greater pornographic content in mainstream media, and greater acceptance of pornography in U.S. society more broadly. In the years since U.S. scholars began critiquing sexual objectification, its normalization and degree of penetration into our daily lives have increased, largely due to a proliferation of marketing and entertainment media images enabled by the Internet and other communication technology. Given this new era of objectification, we conclude that the phenomenon identified by Heflick and Goldenberg is more likely to influence the success of female politicians now than it was in the 1970s (when the sexual objectification of women was first problematized) and that it may also help explain the recent stagnation in U.S. progress towards gender equity in political representation.",TRUE,FALSE,female politicians|gender|internet|media|politics|pornography|sarah palin|sexism|sexual objectification,2018-07-02T11:08:05.983533,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-24T05:06:06.785047,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/citation/,g6rct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tcgjb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/relationships/node/,tcgjb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599e5e5bb83f690259165e7d/,599e5e5bb83f690259165e7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6rct/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6rct,NA

Using U.S. data from the Baylor Religion Survey and cross-national data from the International Social Survey Programme, I demonstrate that women are generally more religious, but less dogmatic. As expected based on gender theory, however, the patterns I uncover are not universal and vary by societal context (i.e., Christian vs. non-Christian nations).

This has meant exposing parts of the energy sector, such as power generation, to competitive entry, while keeping its other parts, such as electricity grids, intact as regional monopolies operating alongside liberalised energy markets. Inspired by earlier studies on economization and valuative regimes, this paper investigates the calculative framings of such transitions, using the Norwegian case as an example. We argue that it constitutes an interesting example of economization, but in a non-traditional sense. Because vital parts of the grid sector remained publicly regulated monopolies, we find the transition included a shift in governing logic from one soundly rooted in engineering and controlled by elected politicians to one influenced chiefly by economics and controlled by complex calculative regimes in which elected officials are studiously hands-off. This economization has had significant implications for the degree of democratic control over vital societal infrastructure. Thus, we argue that processes of economization that operate outside of straightforward privatization should be further studied in order to grasp clearer their implication in modern, liberal societies.",TRUE,FALSE,calculative techniques|economisation|energy infrastructure|science studies,2018-07-02T11:08:04.554721,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-23T09:19:29.489470,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/citation/,xgty9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599d47d16c613b02550a3e45/,599d47d16c613b02550a3e45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xgty9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xgty9,NA

(Nature 535, 547–550; 2016) used a cross-cultural experiment to show that an isolated South American indigenous group, the Tsimane', exhibit indifference to musical dissonance. The study acts as an important counterweight to common beliefs that musical preferences reflect universal, mathematically based harmonic relationships that are biologically determined by low-level perceptual mechanisms. While we applaud their cross-cultural approach, the limited number of populations studied (n=5) makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about causal processes. In particular, the conclusion that consonance is thus ""unlikely to reflect innate biases"" seems too strong, as innateness does not require complete universality. 

Exceptions are always found in any phenomenon as complex as human music. Indeed, our own global analysis of traditional music found dozens of aspects of music that were common cross-culturally, but none that were absolutely universal without exception (Savage et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 112, 8987-8992; 2015). We showed a consistent tendency to avoid dissonance, yet we still found many examples of sustained dissonance in Western and non-Western music (e.g., Eastern European harvest songs, Papua New Guinean lullabies).

Such trends and exceptions are not necessarily indicative of the degree of innateness of aspects of music (which, like other domains of culture, likely reflects some combination of nature and nurture). For example, humans and other animals display an innate aversion to bitter and sour foods, but these can be overridden by cultural conventions and developmental experience (Chandrashekar et al. Nature 444, 288-293; 2006). Diversity in musical perception and production could emerge in the context of weak cognitive biases or relaxation in selective pressures (such as the unusual absence of group performance among the Tsimane'). Broader cross-cultural studies of both perception and production of music and other aspects of human behavior (including cultural evolutionary and developmental frameworks) will be needed to clarify the roles of nature and nurture in shaping human diversity.",TRUE,FALSE,aesthetics|cross-cultural|ethnomusicology|music|music perception,2018-07-02T11:08:04.380428,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-23T02:12:02.986949,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d46|Arts and Humanities|Music|Ethnomusicology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/citation/,964ut,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3vwja/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/relationships/node/,3vwja,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599ce32ab83f690251663d37/,599ce32ab83f690251663d37,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/964ut/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/964ut/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/964ut,NA

Here we fit models to casualty counts from all casualty-producing tornadoes during the period 1995-2016 in order to quantify the interactions between population and energy on casualty (deaths plus injuries) rates. Results show that the more populated areas of the Mid South are substantially and significantly more vulnerable to casualties than elsewhere in the country. In this region casualty rates are significantly higher on the weekend. Night and day casualty rates are similar regardless of where the tornadoes occur. States with a high percentage of older people (65+) tend to have greater vulnerability perhaps related to less agility and fewer communication options.",TRUE,FALSE,casualties|tornado|vulnerability,2018-07-02T11:08:04.229834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-22T19:47:22.087203,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography,James B.

The attitudes of faculty toward their institution play an especially important role in the academic profession. This study examines the specific antecedents of affective, normative and continuance commitment of faculty to their university. This study is an online survey of 317 faculty of Russian higher education institutions. The results of the regression analysis showed that being an undergraduate inbred (ie, working at the university from which one graduated) predicted affective and normative commitment toward the university, while having a post at another higher education institution predicted only affective commitment. Also, faculty who work at several universities have lower levels of emotional attachment to the primary university.",TRUE,FALSE,academic inbreeding|academic profession|faculty|organizational commitment|universities,2018-07-02T11:08:03.175142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-22T14:47:48.673652,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d71|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d73|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision|Higher Education Administration,,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/citation/,mz72v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k3nug/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/relationships/node/,k3nug,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599c4326594d90025b529555/,599c4326594d90025b529555,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz72v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mz72v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mz72v,https://doi.org/10.1080/13583883.2016.1177583

Did Orwell and the like pick up on this disease more than fifty odd years ago? If it was an issue then, one can only imagine its impact of such a thing in our modern apaced society. How appropriate is the word catastrophic?! It validates a feeling that the general populace wont so much as lift an eyebrow until either the cause impacts one in a manner dire, provides arbitrage or is thrust upon them by authority. This type of behavior resonates with the concept of the path of least resistance. Why would anyone do more than the absolute required to get from a to b? I am surely not defending this behavior, I am only trying to understand and rationalize it. Surely society is divided with those willing effort for change and those not so. Those seeking change are surely fueled by ambition applying to almost anything: technology, science and politics or even with general work related matters. In my general experience, one can observe the same overall effects of Gradualism on society by observing the statistical sample that is the workplace.",TRUE,FALSE,Catastrophic Gradualism|change|opportunity cost of Gradualism|Orwell,2018-07-02T11:08:01.911790,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-21T15:58:21.349267,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c81|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c82|Arts and Humanities|Creative Writing|Nonfiction,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/citation/,vqfe9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x2k5s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/relationships/node/,x2k5s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599b0285b83f69025366bb10/,599b0285b83f69025366bb10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vqfe9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vqfe9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vqfe9,NA
