In particular, the question arises whether, in the case of these workers, the working time regulations apply and, if so, how they can be applied in concrete manner. The article contains an analysis on how some principles derived from the CJEU case law can be used to determine whether and under what conditions workers in the collaborative economy can benefit from protection by limiting working time and how can work time be delimited by rest time in their case, given the specificity of their work condition, in order to ensure an effective protection.",TRUE,FALSE,collaborative economy|employees|rest time|self-employees|workers|working time,2020-12-30T22:08:41.890677,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-30T22:06:38.571337,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c62|Law|Jurisprudence,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/citation/,pj63e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe99db0e9ccb9021caee5d9/,5fe99db0e9ccb9021caee5d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj63e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pj63e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pj63e,NA

Citations appearing in the full-text of patent documents have been neglected. We apply modern machine learning methods to extract these citations from the text of USPTO patent documents. Overall, we are able to recover an additional 15 percent of patent citations that could not be found using only front-page data.

Usually these claims are pronounced more by losing parties. This study uses Benford’s law, a law of probability distribution of digits, to investigate whether the election fraud claims might have merit. A sample in this study is made of 808 election data. This data comes from the 2010 Presidential election for representatives from three major political parties and from 2010 General Election data. All of the data points were obtained through reliable government sources, two of which are, the Department of Elections website of Sri Lanka, and the National News Paper statistics (2010). The study contrasts the distribution of the first digit of election results against the Benford’s Law benchmark. After obtaining the results, we organize the data and find median, mean, mode and standard deviation. The preliminary results showe that the data does not align with Benford’s law predictions. In other words, it shows that the data does not follow the law where the mean is larger than the median and there is a positive skewness then it likely follows a Benford’s distribution. The distribution of the first digit of actual data for three parties disagrees with Benford's law. This misalignment is more pronounced for the winning party than for the second and third place parties, respectively.

Nevertheless, the Dutch broke their promise to return West Papua to Indonesian sovereignty. The Dutch continued to insist on West Papua as their land and then increased their military presence in West Papua to prepare for defending the territory. Responding to this, initially, Indonesia made peaceful efforts, namely bilateral diplomacy within the Indonesian-Dutch Union ties, continued with trilateral diplomacy and diplomacy efforts using the Asian African Conference and United Nations organizations. However, Indonesian diplomatic efforts met with deadlock. Hence, another form of diplomacy, the military effort, has been displayed. This study's main aim is to review the 1962 military confrontation on salvaging West Papua in the analysis on war theory. Also, to prove that with sufficient military strength, the country will confidently step up to be the negotiating table winner. The Indonesian military strength at that time was playing a significant role as a deterrent effect. The research uses a qualitative descriptive phenomenology method, using data sources from several books and journals available. The result of the research shows that Indonesia absolutely needs a modern and more rigid military force to maintain its sovereignty, protect our Island and its natural resources.

Small wars but troublesome opposing forces are known as guerrillas. Since war architects popularized the guerrilla theory, it has also been frequently used in wars between forces. The psychological impact of most of the war's success can influence both state and group leaders to apply this model.

The very popularity of this model of warfare has prompted the author to produce an article that aims to compare the three guerrilla architects' frameworks from the point of view of a comprehensive strategy, tactics, and social aspects using the method of collecting data through document study.

It is of great significance to strengthen the construction of the teacher team in rural middle schools for Rural Revitalization in the new era. The problem of structural shortage of teachers, reflected by the phenomenon of “what biology teachers teach is not what they learned” in rural middle schools, is a key issue that has been existing for a long time in the development of rural middle school education in our country. It is also a key problem that must be paid attention to and urgently solved in the face of the new situation, new tasks and new requirements. In response to this phenomenon that caused by the decline of students and the loss of biological teachers in rural middle schools, the government needs to play a supporting role and the school leaders of rural middle schools should innovate their systems and concepts. What’s more, biological teachers should reflect on their hearts and have the educational feelings of being willing to develop the countryside. Only when the government, middle school leaders and biology teachers have formed an educational synergy, can we better solve that harmful phenomenon and promote the healthy and rapid development of rural middle school education.",TRUE,FALSE,Biology Teacher|Improvement Strategy|Rural Middle School|Structural Shortage|Teach not What They Learned,2020-12-28T00:41:20.675484,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-28T00:41:12.873609,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/citation/,e7d4g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe88ac81e6d9701c82fde7f/,5fe88ac81e6d9701c82fde7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e7d4g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e7d4g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e7d4g,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.03.04.166

Eighty-eight Thai second-year undergraduate accounting majors at Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Hat Yai, Thailand took part in the study. The participants completed 10 language-in-talk log assignments over 10 weeks. A pre- and post-questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention to examine the effect of the log assignments in developing participants’ learner autonomy. The reflective log was also used to gather participants’ perceptions of using the log assignments in a conversation course. The results showed that the language-in-talk log assignments aided in enhancing the students’ learner autonomy to set learning goals, select appropriate learning materials, take responsibility, and evaluate their learning. Seeking social assistance, however, did not have a significant difference in mean scores, and participants expressed dissatisfaction over not being able to interact with their peers as in classroom learning. The findings further highlighted the significance of teachers’ presence in scaffolding learners to achieve full autonomy. Overall, the results from this research supported the use of the log assignment as a potential pedagogical tool to enable learners to be responsible for their own learning in a language course.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian EFL Learners|Autonomous Learning|COVID-19|English Language Teaching|Learning Logs|Online Learning,2020-12-28T00:41:00.737175,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-28T00:40:46.523033,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/citation/,xrz6f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe886681e6d9701c82fcc36/,5fe886681e6d9701c82fcc36,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xrz6f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xrz6f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xrz6f,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.03.04.165
