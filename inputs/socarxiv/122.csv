The use of spatial information for predicting and weighting survey nonresponse,"Patterns of nonresponse are often geographically correlated. Existing research has recognized this spatial dependence, using tools to map nonresponse or by means of nonresponse adjustments that draw on geographically aggregated auxiliary information to predict people's participation in surveys. Against this background, this contribution asks whether spatial econometric models can improve nonresponse adjustments and if they provide better propensity weights. Spatial models bear the advantage of an explicit modeling of the underlying spatial process by, for example, including the mutual dependence of neighboring units' response status.

The experience of work is substantially different by occupation, and “essential” occupations consist of disproportionately low-SES and non-White workers. Documenting occupational health disparities during the pandemic is therefore crucial for understanding COVID-19 health inequalities in the United States. This study uses the Current Population Survey microdata combined with occupational data from multiple sources to estimate occupational differences in sickness-related absences from work in March – June 2020 and their contribution to income, educational, and racial/ethnic differences in health inequalities. We find that there has been an unprecedented rise in absences compared to previous years, highly concentrated in transportation, food-related, and personal-care and service occupations. In areas with a major COVID-19 outbreak, these occupations saw rates of absence 6 times higher than all non-healthcare professional occupations. Occupations with the greatest increase in absences are those that are unsuitable for remote work, require workers to work in close proximity to others, pay low wages and rarely provide health insurance. These occupations are, on average, disproportionately non-White, immigrant, low-SES, and have workers in worse than average health. We show that occupation contributes 41% of the total of Black/White differences in absences, 40% of high-low income differences, and 54% of differences between college graduates and those with at most a high school diploma.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|COVID-19|health disparities|inequality|job characteristics|occupations|race and ethnicity|SES|workplace,2020-09-01T09:45:23.151304,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-01T09:45:02.103191,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://cps.ipums.org/cps/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/citation/,adm36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4dbb340f9a08010dadadab/,5f4dbb340f9a08010dadadab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adm36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adm36,NA

The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and many other noncommunicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. As several empirical studies have reported a rising trend of screen time during this pandemic, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as its long-term consequences globally.

Socializing with coworkers is a way to cultivate social capital and is an increasingly prominent aspect of corporate culture. Access to social interactions thus provides access to organizational resources and is a potential mechanism of social closure in workplaces. Dominant groups, such as men in male-dominated workplaces, can limit access to social interactions by controlling the timing, context, and content of social interactions to exclude subordinate groups. This study combines data from the American Time Use Survey and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979, to test the role of sociability in explaining gender inequalities in job tenure, promotions, and earnings. In all three cases, sociability is associated with greater gender inequalities when men predominate in workplaces. In male-dominated jobs, women's earnings fall $3,700 across observed values of sociability, while men's earnings increase by $2,100 Worker-level activity patterns confirm that while women are more sociable than men in non-work contexts, in male-dominated workplaces, women socialize with their coworkers far less frequently than their male colleagues.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-03T08:25:41.843721,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-03T08:25:17.603139,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/citation/,qdbk9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4d7c243461bf00f9be4af7/,5f4d7c243461bf00f9be4af7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qdbk9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qdbk9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qdbk9,NA

Academicians in conservation or allied fields are at the forefront of investigating this conflict. But are their opinions impaired by their emotional attachment with dogs? We investigated this question through an online survey that reached 360 academicians across 139 institutions in India. We assessed the respondent's affinity towards dogs and their perception on their impacts, causes of this problem, suggestions on its mitigation and success of the mitigation measures. We found that although affinity towards dogs had no effect on respondent's perceptions of their impacts, their perceptions on the causes and suggested mitigation measures differed. Respondents who liked dogs suggested ineffective measures like reproductive control and mass adoption to mitigate their impacts, while also acknowledging that the suggested mitigation measures would never work due to multiple reasons. Through our results we show that academicians who are presumed to provide evidence-driven solutions opted for value-driven suggestions. This could be due to high consideration given to emotions in animal rights policies in the country.

This theoretical model has been subject to an ongoing debate regarding the number and nature of constructs it includes. Notable in such debates has been the inclusion or exclusion of mastery-avoidance goals. The purpose of this study was to conduct meta-analytic confirmatory factor analyses (MA-CFA) on two popular achievement goal measures, the Achievement Goal Questionnaire-Revised (AGQ-R) and the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS) achievement goals scales, to analyze the structure of these scales across published studies. The models were a better fit for the data without mastery-avoidance, and overall the data suggest researchers should consider excluding mastery-avoidance.",TRUE,FALSE,achievement goals|achievement goal theory|AGQ-R|PALS,2020-09-20T01:32:00.993424,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-20T01:31:48.023574,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,Kamden Strunk,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/citation/,2mkxs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4d247b0f9a0800cfad8334/,5f4d247b0f9a0800cfad8334,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2mkxs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2mkxs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2mkxs,https://doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2020.1824268

We reflect on the state of this research question and assert that an updated approach is needed to understand the effects of emergent technologies on network structure. Although the absolute changes in average network size are likely to remain elusive, recent perspectives converge on the idea that online technologies make it easier for individuals to shape—or curate—their social connections. Here we merge conflicting views and specify mechanisms through which curation technologies may impact personal network structure. Looking forward, we suggest personality will become more influential in network formation and maintenance when aided by technological levers. Consequently, curation technologies have the potential to increase differences in networks between types of people (for example, extroverts vs introverts) and thus generate new forms of social stratification, despite preserving a stable network size on average. The Comment concludes with empirical and theoretical implications, including the importance of attending to dispersion and examining the societal ramifications of personality-driven curation.",TRUE,FALSE,Dunbar's numbers|network automation|networked individualism|network reflection|online networks|social media|social-network cognition,2020-09-01T09:47:21.397705,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-01T09:47:05.945836,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction",Joseph B.

We find stronger impacts of effects (decreased car ownership and use, increased active travel) in intervention areas where Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) were introduced. Decreased car ownership and use is only found in such areas. Sample size for LTN areas is small and hence uncertainty about effect magnitude is large, but effect direction is consistent. This suggests that to reduce car use as well as increase active travel, LTNs are an important part of the intervention toolbox.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-01T09:46:36.184676,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-01T09:45:56.060759,FALSE,NA,no,Data is not public but an anonymised dataset may be available to researchers on request.,,no,N/A,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/citation/,ebj89,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wqgjk/,wqgjk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4cddc73461bf00aabe917f/,5f4cddc73461bf00aabe917f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebj89/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ebj89/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ebj89,NA
