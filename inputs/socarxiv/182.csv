These projections, based on a vast amount of data, complex estimates and models, have gained high visibility, also in subsequent media coverage and interviews. Yet, IHME highly publicised population data and scenarios suffer from numerous issues with the underlying data, models and scenarios as well as over-simplistic interpretations of their results. This study aims to substantiate our concerns, spelled out earlier in a letter to the Lancet (Basten, Sobotka et al. 2020), and review major issues and weaknesses with IHME projections and their interpretation. First, we critically examine the data issues, models and their underlying assumptions, including implausible uncertainty intervals and contrasts in predicted trends among countries from broader regions, which often share similar economic and cultural characteristics. Second, we discuss the interpretations of the main findings presented in the discussion part of the paper by Vollset et al. and reflect on the media representation of the projection results. In conclusion, we highlight internal inconsistencies in the IHME modelling approach, which lead to questionable projections for many countries and scenarios.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|fertility|GBD|Global Burden of Disease|IHME|Lancet|migration|mortality|population|population forecasts|population projections|population scenarios,2020-09-23T16:58:21.869188,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-23T16:57:55.994569,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/ytf6m/?view_only=0f9e2cd954af4a48a3ee68f16f76757e,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/citation/,5syef,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6ac9b146080901511b218d/,5f6ac9b146080901511b218d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5syef/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5syef,NA

Supplementing the masculinities literature on intragender status competition with psychosocial considerations of shame, alienation, and powerlessness, I argue that liminal complicity is motivated at once by prospects of social mobility and psychic redemption.

In our contemporary period of repeated epidemic outbreaks, it then discusses the necessity for greater inclusion of social scientists works for a better understanding of complex socio-ecological systems. The paper shows how taking anthropology and allied sub-disciplines (anthropology of Nature, medical anthropology and human-animal studies), highlights local knowledge on biodiversity as well as the way social scientists investigate it in relations with other forms of knowledge. Acknowledging recent approaches developed, notably multispecies ethnography, it then purposes to include not only local knowledge but also non-human knowledge for a better prevention of epidemic outbreaks.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, social support for the elderly has proven to be even more crucial, also due to physical distancing. Therefore, this study aims to identify and describe the various types of personal social support networks of the elderly population during the coronavirus pandemic. To this end, a survey of Slovenians older than 64 years was conducted from April 25 to May 4, 2020 on a probability Web-panel-based sample (n = 605).

Clustering was performed for different types of social support (socializing, instrumental support, emotional support) and different characteristics of the social support networks (i.e., type of relationship, number of contacts, geographical distance). The results show that most of the elderly population in Slovenia have a satisfactory social support network, while the share of those without any (accessible) source of social support is significant.

The results reveal a preference for positive emotions, as nurturance and affiliation show the highest frequency of use.

CRD in children and adolescent’s is an enervating condition requiring lifelong treatment in order ‘to survive’. Several researchers have criticised the research on children with CRD as most of these studies rely on standardised tools which seem to be grounded in objectivity and quantification. In this milieu, this Indian study adopts a qualitative approach underpinned by the philosophy of Husserlian phenomenology with descriptive phenomenology as a method. The primary purpose of the study was to delve into the lives of adolescents suffering from CRDs to understand their perceptions about how this challenging condition affects and changes their lives. The study findings uncovered a tapestry of complex interlinked changed ways of lives that the participants with such a condition must adopt along with constant daily struggle of conforming to a prescriptive way of life. The study outlined the lived experiences of these participants which were paradoxical in terms of suffering; hope in their struggle to deal with such a chronic condition and yet moving forward in life.",TRUE,FALSE,chronic kidney disease|health policy|India|lived experience|phenomenonology,2020-09-24T11:45:02.213076,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-24T11:44:41.996892,FALSE,NA,no,Audio taped interviews available upon request for journal submission.,,no,Letters of Institutional support available upon request for journal submission.,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/citation/,rwhcb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f682c5f46080900831af3db/,5f682c5f46080900831af3db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rwhcb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rwhcb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rwhcb,https://doi.org/10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20204365

miracle.” This study uses an interrupted public opinion poll to assess the effect on the moral 
sentiments of the general population of the first weeks of the Chilean social crisis that began in October 2019. Our findings suggest that emotions toward the country, official symbols, and economic development were negatively affected by the crisis. Protests signaled that not 
everything in the country was as thought, generating a moral shock that affected shared emotions about the country. However, at the same time, the specific reciprocal moral 
sentiments between fellow citizens were positively affected. Hence, the social crisis emerges as an opportunity to strengthen collective ties either by sharing sentiments toward who is 
responsible for the movement or between Chileans. In the aftermath of October 18, the effect on emotions could explain the massive scale and durability of the social movement.",TRUE,FALSE,Chile|Emotions|Pride|Public opinion|Social movements,2020-09-21T04:07:40.881535,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-21T04:07:28.006473,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be available after publication.,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/citation/,3rmpt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f68246d46080900831ad65d/,5f68246d46080900831ad65d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rmpt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3rmpt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3rmpt,NA
