Yet, this fixation on trees does not reflect a scientific consensus on the benefits of tree planting across diverse ecosystems and can have problematic implications from both an ecological and socio-political perspective. In this paper, we synthesise cross-disciplinary insights to challenge the common storyline of tree planting as a one-size-fits-all, nature-based solution to climate change and biodiversity loss. We discuss the appeal of tree planting as a panacea, and how this conflicts with reality, in which a diverse range of stakeholders represent various perspectives and pursue a plurality of goals. We assess the communicative aspects of trees and forests, exploring the symbolic power of a ‘tree’ and how practices in remote-sensing and scientific modelling reinforce the dominant tree planting narrative. We then reflect on the ecological and human contexts that need to be considered in planning of tree planting and how historical ecological baselines continue to influence ecosystem management goals. Finally, we explore how current conservation narratives value forest over other kinds of nature and demonstrate the important – but overlooked – role that non-forest landscapes such as open and semi-open vegetation play in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. We conclude that we need to rethink the dominant tree-planting narrative, being mindful and critical of the socio-political drivers behind tree planting initiatives and potential biases, and allow ecological and sociocultural contexts to inform tree-promotion efforts and appropriateness.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|environmental governance|global forest models|Nature-based Solutions|science-policy-society knowledge co-production|symbolism,2021-04-28T10:48:08.096439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T10:43:07.958293,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/citation/,5ymqt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60893431a9746602252f9c86/,60893431a9746602252f9c86,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ymqt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ymqt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ymqt,NA

The universe of the study is created by 650 athletes from 65 universities that attended to the Inter-University Kick-Boxing Championship in Turkey (between 06-11 March 2018). And the sample of the study is 87 athletes who voluntarily accepted to participate in the study. In the study, ""Self-Assessment Inventory in Multiple Intelligence Areas,"" which was developed by Howard Gardner, translated into Turkish by Saban (2002) and whose validity and reliability (α = 0.93) were made, was used as the data collection tool in the study. SPSS 20 package program was used to analyze the data. The normality of the distribution was examined using the Shapiro Wilk test. It was observed that the available data had normal distribution. In the analysis of the data, descriptive statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that compares the multiple intelligence levels of the athletes according to the universities they attend, the Tukey test, and the Independent sample t test that compares the multiple intelligence levels of the athletes according to the age variable were used. At the end of the study, depending on the age variable, Linguistic intelligence (p = .663; p &lt;0.05), Logical intelligence (p = .724; p &lt;0.05), Visual intelligence (p = 0.900; p &lt;0.05), Musical intelligence (p = .815; p &lt;0.05), Nature intelligence (p = .450; p &lt;0.05), Interpersonal intelligence (p = .713; p &lt;0.05), Kinesthetic intelligence (p = .548; p &lt;0.05), Intrinsic intelligence (p = .799; p &lt;0.05) no significant difference was found between the sub-dimension levels and the ages of the athletes.",TRUE,FALSE,Kick boxing|Multiple Intelligences|University Student,2021-04-28T10:51:21.290318,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T10:45:32.875668,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/citation/,bw2av,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6088e2977166fa01fee90b55/,6088e2977166fa01fee90b55,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bw2av/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bw2av/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bw2av,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.02.212

Since the pandemic began, the public has experienced tremendous uncertainty and worry about SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially because scientific understanding of a novel disease takes time to develop and disseminate. During periods of extreme uncertainty and worry, people may revise their fertility intentions, drawing on their prior experiences during prior epidemics. To investigate this possibility, we examine whether women’s social proximity to Zika during the Zika epidemic predict their fertility intentions during the Covid-19 pandemic. We apply Structural Equation Models on unique microdata from 3,998 Brazilian women in Brazil, the country most affected by Zika, to understand whether a novel infectious disease outbreak left lasting imprints that shape fertility intentions during a subsequent novel infectious disease outbreak, the Covid-19 pandemic, and whether these scarring effects operate differently by race. Results demonstrate a scarring effect such that a woman’s social proximity to Zika directly predicts fertility intentions three years later, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, regardless of whether a woman herself had or suspected that she had Zika. Findings also show that Zika social proximity is associated with increased perceived risk of Covid-19 infection and worry about pregnancy and fetal complications from Covid-19. We also show that white and non-white women have scarred differently from the Zika epidemic. Broadly, our findings speak to the transformative consequences of novel infectious disease outbreaks that go beyond mortality and health.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazil|Covid-19|fertility|mortality|reproductive outcomes|Zika,2021-04-28T11:37:45.741508,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T11:09:55.889276,TRUE,"Acknowledgments: This research was funded by grant R01HD091257, Reproductive Responses to the Zika Virus Epidemic in Brazil, awarded to PI L.

This situation has highlighted the need to assess whether existing national electoral legislation includes enough instruments to ensure citizens’ safety during voting procedures, even under the conditions of a global pandemic. Such instruments, often grouped under the umbrella of voter facilitation or convenience voting, range from voting in advance and various forms of absentee voting (postal, online, and proxy voting) to assisted voting and voting at home and in hospitals and other healthcare institutions. While most democracies have implemented at least some form of voter facilitation, substantial cross-country differences still exist. In the push to develop pandemic-sustainable elections in different institutional and political contexts, variation in voter facilitation makes it possible to learn from country-specific experiences. As accessibility and inclusiveness are critical components of elections for ensuring political legitimacy and accountability, particularly in times of crisis, these lessons are of utmost importance.

In this study, we focus on Finland, where the Parliament decided in March 2021 to postpone for two months the municipal elections that were originally scheduled to be held on April 18. Although the decision was mostly justified by the sudden and dramatic daily increase in new COVID-19 infections, the inability to guarantee those in quarantine the opportunity to vote was included among the likely risks. The failure to organize health-safe voting procedures to accommodate the original schedule emphasizes a certain paradox in the Finnish electoral legislation: caution in introducing new facilitation instruments has led to lower levels of preparedness and flexibility in crisis situations. Although a forerunner in implementing extensive advance voting opportunities, Finland has only recently introduced postal voting, which is restricted to voters living abroad. Hence, we ask: what can be learned from this form of convenience voting if expanded to all voters to enhance the sustainability of elections in future crises like pandemics? 

Our analyses are based on a survey conducted among non-resident voters (n = 2,100) after the 2019 parliamentary elections in which postal voting from abroad was allowed for the first time. Our results show that whereas trust in the integrity of postal voting is quite high, various efforts needed from individual voters substantially increase the costs of postal voting. Postal operations also raise concerns. Furthermore, voters felt that requiring two witnesses made postal voting cumbersome, an issue that needs to be resolved, particularly if applying postal voting in the context of a pandemic. The Finnish case constitutes a concrete example of a situation in which voter facilitation targeted to a particular segment of society may become a testbed for electoral engineering (see Norris 2004) that will improve voting opportunities for everyone.",TRUE,FALSE,convenience voting|electoral reform|pandemic elections|postal voting|postponing elections|voter facilitation,2021-04-28T10:48:52.547209,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T10:43:41.375390,FALSE,NA,no,"The data sets generated for this study will be available in the Finnish Social Science Data Archive, https://www.fsd.tuni.fi/en/, after the ongoing research project “Facilitating Electoral Participation from Abroad” (FACE) is completed in 2021.",,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,Wass|Hanna; Peltoniemi|Johanna; Weide|Marjukka; Nemčok|Miroslav,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/citation/,v2cq5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6087fa1c7166fa0184e8d0b7/,6087fa1c7166fa0184e8d0b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v2cq5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v2cq5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v2cq5,NA

However, research on the life-course transitions and trajectories of disabled adolescents remains sparse. This working paper addresses the lack of longitudinal evidence surrounding school-to-work transitions of disabled young people in England. We analyse longitudinal data from Next Steps in order to provide a descriptive analysis of post- 16 transitions and early socioeconomic attainment of disabled young people in England. Our analysis moves beyond existing studies by examining the whole range of post-16 destinations, and by exploring variation between different disability categories wherever possible. We also examine whether disability differentials in post-16 destinations and economic activity in early adulthood vary by social class, ethnicity, and gender, highlighting opportunities for intersectional analyses. Overall, our results show substantial disability differentials in post-16 destinations. We find that disabled young people are less likely to stay in post-16 education and more likely to experience unemployment compared to non- disabled peers. Results reveal inequalities in the type of post-16 education young people follow too, with disabled cohort members more likely to be in general Further Education colleges and less likely to attend school sixth forms and sixth form colleges, as well as university, compared to students with no long-standing limiting conditions and/or learning difficulties. We find pronounced disability gaps in young people’s main activity at age 25, documenting variations by other social divisions. We also outline avenues for future research on adolescent disability and social inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,disability|ethnicity|gender|life-course research|longitudinal research|school-to-work transitions|SEN|social class|social inequality|social stratification|sociology|special educational needs,2021-04-28T11:51:41.983169,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T11:20:51.831094,TRUE,This research was funded by the Leverhulme Trust Research Project Grant Educational Pathways and Work Outcomes of Disabled Young People in England (RPG-2020-202).,available,NA,https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5545,available,NA,https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5545,prereg_designs,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/citation/,vwcmt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6087eebcf1616001ad9ca0a8/,6087eebcf1616001ad9ca0a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwcmt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vwcmt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vwcmt,NA
