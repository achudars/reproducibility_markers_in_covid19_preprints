Because of this ambiguity, we systematically review the empirical literature on youth crime between 1990 to 2020 to gauge how vulnerability is understood now and over time. A total of 19 studies out of 631 original records met the inclusion criteria. The included studies neatly fit into pre-existing classifications of vulnerability from the research literature.

For some, this indicates structural integration, while others alert against an ‘immigrant optimism trap’ when ambition trumps ability, leading to high risks of non-completion. Using longitudinal Swedish population data (n≈90,000), we estimate the upper secondary ‘completion gap’ to 12% to the detriment of immigrant-background students. We then address the ‘trap hypothesis’ via two counterfactual analyses. The first shows that if immigrant-background youth made similar educational choices as other students at the same GPA, the completion gap would shrink by 3.4 percentage points. The second analysis suggests that restricting admission to programmes based on prior GPA, which would lead to a massive relocation of low- and mid-GPA students to vocational programmes, would reduce the completion gap by 2.2 percentage points. These changes must be considered marginal in view of the substantial restrictions of choice that either of these measures would entail.

These findings reveal significant limits to the explanatory power of two widely used concepts in this area: triggers and identity.

This paper aims to address the research question: What is an effective framework to strategically select nationally reported serious adverse events in healthcare for investigation to improve patient safety? 
Background
The healthcare system is globally under strain due to an aging population with increasing co-morbidities. Serious adverse events remain a consistent challenge. Patient safety can be improved by investigating cases and addressing underlying systemic risks. However, due to resource limitations, only a limited number of cases can be investigated. This necessitates a strategic selection of cases with the greatest potential for improving patient safety. This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework that identifies the key strategic issues that should be addressed when setting up a new national healthcare safety investigative body to select adverse events for investigation.
Methods
This study will primarily draw on semi-structured interviews with senior stakeholders in key healthcare regulatory agencies in Norway. For comparative purposes, a stakeholder from a key United Kingdom healthcare agency was also interviewed. The interview template is developed based on insights from a literature review and develop existing safety frameworks such as the Framework for Managing Risk. The paper also draws on selected tools from Strategy Management.
Results
A novel theoretical framework was developed to help set up case selection mechanism in a new national investigative body. The framework consists of four strategic themes that should be considered both sequentially and cyclically. Within each theme several key policy questions were identified.
(1)	Governance: role and powers, independence, and stakeholder engagement 
(2)	Monitoring risk: adverse events, quality indicators, and unexplained variation
(3)	Strategic portfolio: broad coverage, vulnerable groups, and underreporting 
(4)	Individual case selection: outcome, systemic risk, and learning potential
Conclusions
Policy makers should carefully consider the themes and questions in the proposed theoretical framework when setting up a new national safety investigative agency. In turn, this can ensure that the implemented selection mechanism identifies cases with the greatest potential to improve patient safety.",TRUE,FALSE,adverse event|healthcare|health policy|investigation|patient safety,2021-06-22T15:52:03.746824,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-22T14:55:46.154473,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/citation/,92c85,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d1bcb5f44078005e7582e0/,60d1bcb5f44078005e7582e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92c85/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92c85/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92c85,NA

Cross-sectional network studies allow us to examine who bullies whom or who defends whom, as well as the agreement on these dyadic relationships. Longitudinal network studies allow us to particularly examine selection and influence processes. The longitudinal studies with the most power have shown that selection and influence processes play a role for bullies. For victims, selection and influence processes have been found in adolescence (secondary education), but not in childhood (elementary education). Social network dynamics in bullying and victimization can also be linked to research on the impact of social norms or the evaluation of an intervention. Recent studies have also started to examine interdependencies between multiple positive and negative relationships. Most social network research on bullying and victimization has been done in late childhood or early adolescence. A few studies, however, have shown that it is also feasible to examine network-behavior dynamics at younger ages. Further research is necessary on whether and how individuals in a network, relationship patterns, or the entire network structure can be targeted by interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescence|bullying|childhood|longitudinal|social network|social norms|victimization,2021-06-22T09:46:03.926500,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-22T09:45:36.845024,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/citation/,fbxwt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d1af2d73c72e006dc3be76/,60d1af2d73c72e006dc3be76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fbxwt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fbxwt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fbxwt,NA

Illicit drug offences were a notable exception, however few studies have considered changes at specific drug market locations. This study documents how key drug markets were affected during the lockdown. Using a spatiotemporal generalised additive model (GAM), this study examines the pattern of drug offence detection throughout the city of Brisbane, Australia and identifies areas of change during lockdown. Statistical meshblock analysis is used to illustrate discrete changes at key market locations. Contrary to aggregate-level analysis, we show that several of the major drug markets experienced a significant decline in drug offence detections, but that these local changes were offset by a displacement to neighbouring areas. We also find some preliminary evidence of the emergence of new outer-urban markets. Existing drug markets were adversely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, however drug market activity was likely displaced rather than diminished.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|COVID-19|drug markets|drug offence detection|pandemic,2021-06-22T05:10:26.683427,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-22T05:10:07.768111,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/citation/,sbh7j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d1586b7020ec0042e04c13/,60d1586b7020ec0042e04c13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sbh7j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sbh7j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sbh7j,NA
