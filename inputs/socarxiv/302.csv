I argue that focusing on the rise of panethnic CSOs reveals an underappreciated mechanism that has mobilized Asian Americans and Latinos—the welfare state. The War on Poverty programs incentivized non-black minority community organizers to form panethnic CSOs to gain access to state resources and serve the economically disadvantaged in their communities. Drawing on extensive archival research, I identify this mechanism and test it with my original dataset of 818 Asian American and Latino advocacy organizations and CSOs. Leveraging the Reagan budget cut, I show that dismantling the War on Poverty programs reduced the founding rate of panethnic CSOs. I further estimated that a 1% increase in federal funding was associated with the increase of the two panethnic CSOs during the War on Poverty. The findings demonstrate how access to state resources forces activists among non-primary beneficiary groups to build new political identities that fit the dominant image of the policy beneficiaries.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian Americans|Community organizing|Latinos|Social policy,2020-04-04T17:44:00.602611,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-04T17:43:40.404826,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FFLUPBJ,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/citation/,n83xs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e883bfd4301660017a0e9bd/,5e883bfd4301660017a0e9bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n83xs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n83xs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n83xs,NA

That is, perhaps, unless you work on open source software. Right now, global research communities are united to collaborate on solving the threat of the pandemic, sharing resources and knowledge more efficiently and effective than ever before, a process broadly described as ‘open scholarship’ (Dunleavy, 2020). This is essentially akin to how free and open source software (FOSS) communities have been operating now for decades (Willinsky, 2005). Recently, we participated in a “massively open online paper”, or MOOP, that explored the intersections between FOSS and open scholarship (Tennant, Agarwal, et al., 2020). Here, we want to summarise our key findings from that project, and place them in the context of the current outbreak. Critically, this pandemic shows us that many of the pervasive and systemic issues surrounding the evaluation, valuation, use and operationalisation of “openness” in scholarship can be extremely easily bypassed when the social demand and urgency is there, thus showing that the primary barriers towards open scholarship are inherently political and not technical.",TRUE,FALSE,Communities|Coronavirus|FOSS|Free Software|Global Health|Open Data|Open Research|Open Scholarship|Open Science|Open Source|Pandemic|Peer review|Preprints|Public Health|Research evaluation|SARS-CoV-2|Software,2020-04-04T17:42:40.654364,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-04T17:42:33.771624,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/citation/,5kdbx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8818f9d69735000cbe17b7/,5e8818f9d69735000cbe17b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kdbx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kdbx,NA

Around 60–80% of SES gaps in language at the end of primary school are attributable to gaps settled before formal schooling, while at most 20–40% is attributable to SES operating during the school years.

Yet it has already caused significant disruptions to the life of people across the country. The higher rate of confirmed cases and deaths have so far been concentrated in urban areas. However, it is only a matter of weeks for this lethal virus to reach remote and poor areas in the rural part of the country. When this happens, it will wreak havoc. This paper thus proposes a policy deriving from a risk assessment for local leaders from these areas. The expectation is that this strategy designed for impoverished and deprived areas can contribute to reduce the risk of the horrendous effects that this pathogen can have in these vulnerable communities and their fragile economies.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazil|COVID-19|crisis management|new coronavirus|public policy|risk assessment|vulnerability,2020-04-04T17:36:20.977773,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-04T17:35:56.322082,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/citation/,4739g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e86a0abd0e3540251b4be2c/,5e86a0abd0e3540251b4be2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4739g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4739g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4739g,NA
