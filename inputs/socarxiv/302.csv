The study explores students self-confident and its association with students' actual performance in English course in their different academic programs. A multimodal methodology was used to fulfill the research purpose and answer the research questions. A 25-item survey questionnaire and final examination grades were used to collect data. Two hundred forty-one students agreed to participate in the study. They completed the questionnaire and agreed to release their final grades to be a part of the collected data. The data were coded and analyzed by SPSS software. The findings indicated a significant difference in students' performance in English courses between participants' academic programs on the one hand. Students' self-confidence in their English language skills, on the other hand, was not significantly different between participants' academic programs. Data analysis also revealed no correlational relationship between students' self-confidence level and their language skills and their performance.

Teachers initiate learners to the whole learning process, and their feedback constitutes the significant step forward that triggers learners towards enunciating a language. As an illustration, Swain (1985, 2000) uses empirical evidence to show the importance of teacher’s feedback during the production of speaking. Relatable to feedback during oral activity are issues that highlight teachers’ pronunciation, fluency, body language, facial expressions, and error correction during the production phase. To identify these areas, the current article used students’ questionnaires. The general aim is to gauge learners’ perceptions, practices and problems. Results highlight the pivotal teachers’ role in the whole process. Therefore, the specific aim of this study is to investigate the role of teachers’ feedback during speaking activities in Moroccan classes. Results show that interaction enhancement and negotiation density do indeed establish the interconnection between accuracy and fluency.

It illustrated if there is an effect of learning culture on English language competence to the students of Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University . The studyʼs methodology included a questionnaire administered to 70 undergraduate female students in the English department at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. Results show that Saudi students recognized that culture and language are related to each other and the learning process cannot be fully realized without consideration of both aspects. Moreover, the study found that learning the English language with its corresponding cultural elements will enhance the speed and enjoyment of Saudi studentsʼ learning process. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that learning a foreign language not only involves studying syntactic structures or learning new vocabularies, but also should incorporate some cultural elements. From Saudi students' point of view, the only difficulty that might face them is the differences between Arabic and English cultures.

The shortness of linguistic data in texts of the kind makes it challenging for conventional stylometric authorship methods to assign disputed texts to their real authors. As thus, this study proposes a new stylometric authorship system based on morphological patterns and letter mapping properties. The assumption is that these carry unique and distinctive stylistic features that can be usefully used to recognize possible authors of disputed texts. The study is based on a corpus of 259 flash fiction stories written in Arabic. Cluster analysis was for grouping documents that have shared linguistic features together. Results indicate that all texts were successfully matched with their real authors. It can be concluded that morphological information can be usefully used for improving the performance of authorship attribution and detection in Arabic texts due to the unique stylistic features of the affixation processes in Arabic.

It aims to investigate the types of information tones in Obama’s speech concerning the termination component and dominance/non-dominance factor based on Brazil’s model (1997) of discourse intonation. This study confines itself to the American political interview and it is a qualitative study. The findings show that all the information tone types (proclaiming, referring, and level) are used in Obama’s speech and the high termination is most common level, which is used by Obama in his speech in order to emphasize the information and capture the attention of the interviewer. Generally, it was found that the dominance factor was higher than the non-dominance factor, which reflects that Obama took his status as the controller of the discourse during his speech with the interviewer and most of his speech carries contrastive information, which contradicts the interview’s expectation.

The study conducted for 12 weeks in 2018- 2019 academic year, in Zulfi College of Education, Majmaah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The sample consists of 64 female students divided equally into two groups: experimental and control groups. The experimental group studied an advanced college writing course supported by the creative writing multitasks designed by the researcher. A group of pre and posttest design was applied in the study. When the pre and posttest’s scores of the experimental group were analyzed and compared, it was detected that there was a statistically considerable difference in the pre- and posttest scores, in favor of posttest’s score. Also, it shows that there was a significant difference in the mean scores of the experimental and control group posttest’s scores, favoring the experimental group posttest’s score. These results prove the main research hypothesis: Creative writing multi-tasks have a significant impact on developing the experimental group’s creative writing competence, compared to the control group. The findings indicate that using creative writing multitasks has a positive effect on developing the students’ creative writing competence in both fiction and nonfiction essays. It is recommended for English language teachers to adopt similar creative writing multitasks when teaching writing skill.",TRUE,FALSE,and processes|creative writing|creative writing competence|multitasks (MULTSK)|strategies|techniques,2019-10-11T16:51:40.769826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:50:01.642989,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/citation/,tpjzm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da0146526eb50000e7f8e14/,5da0146526eb50000e7f8e14,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpjzm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tpjzm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tpjzm
