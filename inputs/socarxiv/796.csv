Living in a neighborhood context characterized by aggressive policing may affect one's mental health, especially for men who are the primary targets of police stops. We examine whether there is an association between psychological distress and neighborhood-level aggressive policing structures (i.e., frisking and use of force by police) and whether that association varies by gender. The 2009-2011 New York City (NYC) Stop, Question, and Frisk Database is aggregated to the neighborhood level (N=34) and merged with individual data from the 2012 NYC Community Health Survey (N= 8,066) via the United Hospital Fund neighborhood of respondents' residence. Weighted multilevel generalized linear models are used to assess main and gendered effects of neighborhood exposures to aggressive police stops on psychological distress measured with Kessler-6 items. The neighborhood stop rate exhibits inconsistent associations with psychological distress; however, neighborhood-level frisk and use of force densities are linked to higher levels of non-specific psychological distress among men, but not women. Specifically, men exhibit higher levels of nervousness, effort, worthlessness, and severe distress in aggressively surveilled neighborhoods. Male residents are affected by the escalation of stop-and-frisk policing in a neighborhood. Living in a context of aggressive policing should be considered an important risk factor that contributes to men's health.

One aspect of this public policy is a procedure known as Terry stops, which involves police temporarily detaining persons who may be acting criminally. While only a small percentage of these stops result in arrest, warrants, or the recovery of illegal materials, a sizeable portion become physically invasive (i.e., involve body searches and use of force). The health effects of invasive policing practices for the community at-large are unknown. Using microlevel health data from 2009-2012 NYC Community Health Survey nested within mesolevel data from the 2009-2012 NYC Stop, Question, and Frisk dataset, this study employs multilevel mixed effects models to evaluate contextual and ethnoracially-variant associations between invasive aspects of Terry stops and multiple dimensions of illness (poor/fair health, diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma episodes, body weight). Terry stops are, in fact, associated with worse health. The most consistent Terry measures associated with illness is the likelihood that stops will result in frisking. More limited deleterious effects can be attributed to the likelihood that stops will result in use of force and to minority-to-white ratios of frisk and use of force. The health effects of Terry stops vary by ethnoracial group in complex ways. For instance, the minority-to-white frisking ratio and the likelihood that stops will involve use of force increase certain dimensions of illness for minorities; meanwhile, the minority-to-white use of force ratio reduces the likelihood of diabetes for Blacks.

around for at least half a century, the Internet greatly expanded the
availability and reduced the cost of ICD. Examples of ICD include data on
Internet searches, social media data, and user data from civic platforms.

As most scholars, in the field of humanities, take intellectual property for granted, the representation of Kant like an intellectual property forerunner is still a dangerously mistaken commonplace. According to Kant's Architectonic of Pure Reason the philosopher is closer to a lawgiver than to an artificer, if philosophy is considered in its Weltbegriff or cosmopolitan concept (AA.03: 542.23-30). Because such a lawgiving is based upon that reason with which every human being is endowed, the laws of reason should be thought as public laws and not as individual, private creations. How could a public law be consistently viewed as an object of private intellectual property? Kant avoids such a contradiction because his justification of authors' right does not rely on intellectual property, but on the meaning and the function of both authors and publishers in the world of the public use of reason. Therefore, Kant's theory of copyright is compatible with the Weltbegriff of philosophy. Furthermore, more interestingly, it is also possible to demonstrate that it is consistent with his general theory of property, as stated in the Metaphysik der Sitten. The following essay, after presenting a short sketch of Kant's authors right as personal right, will introduce Fichte's theory of intellectual property to strengthen the case of Kant's rejection of intellectual property, by comparing his ideas with the theory of an actual intellectual property advocate, like Fichte. Eventually, to read the proposed interpretation of Kant in a wider theoretical perspective, it will attempt to connect it to his general theory of property of the Metaphysik der Sitten.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:24.050673,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T20:48:59.618000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/citation/,b9zfr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z44g7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/relationships/node/,z44g7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578bef3db83f6901f0c06370/,578bef3db83f6901f0c06370,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9zfr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b9zfr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b9zfr,NA

Openaire) and it is trying to implement it in the Horizon 2020 program, 
the gap between the tools and the human beings – researchers, citizen 
scientists, students, ordinary people – is still wide. The necessity to 
dictate open access publishing as a mandate for the EU funded research – 
ten years after the BOAI - is an obvious symptom of it: there is a chasm 
between the net and the public use of reason. To escalate the 
advancement and the reuse of research, we should federate the multitude 
of already existing open access journals in federal open overlay 
journals that receive their contents from the member journals and boost 
it with their aggregation power and their semantic web tools. The 
article contains both the theoretical basis and the guidelines for a 
project whose goals are: 1. making open access journals visible, highly 
cited and powerful, by federating them into wide disciplinary overlay 
journals; 2. avoiding the traps of the “authors pay” open access 
business model, by exploiting one of the virtue of federalism: the 
federate journals can remain little and affordable, if they gain 
visibility from the power of the federal overlay journal aggregating 
them; 3. enriching the overlay journals both through semantic annotation 
tools and by means of open platforms dedicated to host ex post peer 
review and experts comments; 4. making the selection and evaluation 
processes and their resulting data as much as possible public and open, 
to avoid the pitfalls (e. g, the serials price crisis) experienced by 
the closed access publishing model. It is about time to free academic

One prominent recent study, Newman, Johnston, and Lown (2015), argues that, consistent with the conflict theory, exposure to higher levels of local income inequality lead lower-income people to become more likely to reject—and higher-income people to become more likely to accept—the dominant U.S. ideology of meritocracy.  Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study's own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis.  We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion.  Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.

The answer of Kant is contained in the fifth preliminary article of the Perpetual Peace and it leans towards non-interventionism: a bad constitution can never justify a war, because it may be the root only of a scandalum acceptum. To understand the meaning of scandalum acceptum we have to become aware that it is a term originating from moral theology, which we should translate into the language of international law. Most of Kant's contemporaries still understood the scandal as the sin of advertising a sinful behavior. A scandalum is only acceptum, however, if the act that inspired others to sin has been done without the intention to give them a bad example. A flawed constitution can only be the occasion of a scandalum acceptum because its legal power does not spread its influence beyond the border of its state. If a nation chooses to imitate the allegedly wrong constitution of another state, its choice only depends on its sovereignty, because it is a matter of internal constitutional law.

the established system of scholarly publishing in which scientific 
publishers seemed to be authors' best friends? A backward itinerary 
across three German Enlightenment thinkers who took part to the debate 
on (unauthorized) reprinting shows us ways – usual and unusual - in 
which culture can flourish in a copy-friendly environment. While Fichte 
endorsed an intellectual property theory, took the function of 
publishers for granted and neglected the interests of the public, Kant 
saw authors as speakers and justified publishers' rights only as long as 
they work as spokespersons helping writers to reach the public. 
Eventually Lessing's project was designed to foster authors' autonomy by 
means of a subscription system that could have worked only on the basis 
of a free information flow and of direct relationships with and within 
the public itself. Such a condition can be compared with the situation 
of ancient auctores, with one difference: while the ancient communities

He was so lucky to live before the ""great division"" between humanities and natural science and to witness the first media revolution, the transition from orality to literacy. The age of print and of books manufactures made us to forget that communication concerns above all authors. Now, however, the internet makes it possible to publish our writings without giving them away: humanities scholars could emerge from nonage and take back all what they delegated to the publishers and their market concern, from which they usually earn very little.

which he includes the works of art. For
the very principle of private property, a legitimate purchaser has the 
right to replicate and to share them
without restrictions.
Kant recognizes copyright only on written texts, by conceiving them as 
speeches that exclusively authorized
spokespersons - the publishers - may convey to the public in the name of 
their authors. The rights of the
authorized publishers, however, are justified only if they help the 
public to get the texts.
In a Kantian environment, open source software would be worth of 
copyright protection, because it can be
conceived as a speech meant to human beings. On the contrary, Kant would 
treat closed source programs as
works of art, without according them copyright protection, because, as 
none is allowed to read and to
understand them, they cannot be conceived as a speeches meant to the 
public. Closed source programs are like
sealed books that no one is allowed to read: why do we keep on taking 
for granted that they are worth of
copyright protection?",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:03.553112,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T19:16:40.774000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/citation/,qvryx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nrcqf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/relationships/node/,nrcqf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578bd99ab83f6901f2c062e4/,578bd99ab83f6901f2c062e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvryx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qvryx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qvryx,NA
