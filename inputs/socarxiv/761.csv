they do not all use the same language. Drawing on content analysis of 1,935
speeches given between 2000 and 2010, this study examines how five North
African autocrats appropriated the global discursive form of democracy by
altering its content. These leaders proposed that the special circumstances
of each country preclude any one-size-fits-all global definition of
democracy, whose imposition in their countries, they claim, would be
inappropriate, ineffective, or dangerous. Through their speeches, these
rulers redefined democracy by engaging in active ideological work, weaving
together discourses that combined global norms, state interests, and local
values. This suggests that, in addition to being a benchmark by which to
measure modes of governance, “democracy” is also a language game played
between actors on a global stage. By synthesizing theoretical frameworks
drawn from world polity and social movement studies traditions, this study
shows that peripheral actors may adapt global discourses purposefully and
strategically rather than encountering them as passive participants in a
purely mimetic cultural diffusion process. This has implications for a wide
range of global norms that are open to appropriation by local actors

In this review I propose that cultural evolution theory, including both a sophisticated view of human behaviour and a methodological attitude to modelling and quantitative analysis, provides a useful framework to study the effects and the developments of media in the digital age. 

I will first give a general presentation of the cultural evolution framework, and I will then introduce this more specific research program with two illustrative topics.

The first topic concerns how cultural transmission biases, that is, simple heuristics such as ""copy prestigious individuals"" or ""copy the majority"", operate in the novel context of digital media. The existence of transmission biases is generally justified with their adaptivity in small-scale societies. How do they operate in an environment where, for example, prestigious individuals possess not-relevant skills, or popularity is explicitly quantified and advertised?

The second aspect relates to fidelity of cultural transmission. Digitally-mediated interactions support cheap and immediate high-fidelity transmission, in opposition, for example, to oral traditions. How does this change the content that is more likely to spread?  

Overall, I suggest the usefulness of a ""long view"" to our contemporary digital environment, contextualised in cognitive science and cultural evolution theory, and I discuss how this perspective could help us to understand what is genuinely new and what is not.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural attraction|cultural evolution|cultural transmission|digital media|Preprint|socarxiv|social media|transmission biases,2018-07-02T10:48:27.618677,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-20T12:24:59.448000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/citation/,cbwkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j6mpz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/relationships/node/,j6mpz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e12a9cb83f6901d00bda25/,57e12a9cb83f6901d00bda25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbwkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cbwkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cbwkt,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00636

This paper discusses and presents findings drawn from a quantitative
attitudinal survey of practising social workers conducted in the republic
of Ireland. Sampling was conducted across Ireland within a population of
3900 practising social workers approximately and resulted in 128 responses,
111 of which were complete. The purpose of the study was to explore the
role of advocacy approaches in social work practice and to examine the
relationship of professional social work to independent advocacy groups.
The study found that social workers frequently engage in advocacy tasks.
However, despite this, it also found that a majority of social workers feel
that the tasks associated with advocacy are best placed with other groups
in Irish society.  The study found that a majority of social workers
acknowledge sharing a similar value-base to independent advocacy groups.
However, it also suggests that the relationship between social workers and
advocacy groups is complex and conflictual. In this respect, it was
suggested that while social workers recognise the importance of advocacy
groups, they also acknowledge that advocacy groups do not always complement
the social work role. Ultimately this study shows that many
practitioners acknowledge
that the necessity for advocacy groups in Ireland can be ascribed to the
causal effects of contemporary social work practice.
