We performed an exploratory study to examine how travellers perceive the risk-related to COVID-19 and how the outbreak has affected their commuting and non-commuting travel activities. Building on previous studies, we propose a working hypothesis of personal risk perception and trip adjustment decision and collect information to preliminary check our hypothesis. We report on our work, and the results of an online survey carried out between March 12-19, 2020, which collected 71 responds from countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East in this working paper. 
Our results illustrate how the respondents altered their travel, their rationales, the precautionary actions they took, their foremost concerns, the sources of information they based their decisions on, and how useful they found teleconference as an alternative. Also, we observed their risk-related perception concerning the proposed model. We found several potential correlations and some regional and country variations but were unable to draw any definitive conclusion due to the limited sample size.

Among the explanations offered are that evaluators lack time and use shortcuts, that they lack the expertise to judge things properly, that they can't put aside personal biases and we must hide the names of authors, and that they are conscientious instead of creative and cannot judge new ideas. All of these are actually wrong. As a literary analyst, I spent the last ten years independently studying this same problem in book and movie production. I've found that the human decision-making apparatus doesn't work the way we think, and the solutions based on this misunderstanding could never have solved the problem.

The review reports are gathered as part of the peer review process of the European Scientific Journal (ESJ). This journal maintains a single-blind peer review procedure and optional open review. Reviewers are familiar with the names of the authors but not vice versa. When sending the review reports, the reviewers can opt to reveal their identity to the authors. 
343 review reports from members of the ESJ editorial board, gathered within the period of May to July 2019, were analyzed. The data analysis was performed using Python programing language based on NumPy, Pandas, and Scipy packages.
Half of the reviewers decided to choose the open option and reveal their names to the authors of the papers. The other half remained anonymous. The results show that female reviewers more often decide to remain anonymous than their male colleagues. However, there is no significant difference in the review reports on the basis of gender or country of institutional affiliation of the reviewers. 
Revealing identity did not make difference in reviewers’ point appraisal in the review reports. This difference was not significant. 
However, majority of the reviewers who recommended rejection in their review reports were not willing to reveal their identities.

Even among the insured, substantial barriers to accessing services inhibit health care utilization. This study was focused on examining the influence of selected health services access barriers to the healthcare utilization among the publicly insured residents in the Philippines. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 7,234 Filipino residents chosen using multi-stage cluster sampling. Path analysis was used to determine the connections among the study variables. Descriptive analysis revealed that the respondents always perceive approachability and ability to reach as supply-side and demand-side access barriers, respectively, among others. Correlation analysis revealed that supply-side and demand-side access barriers to care and the healthcare utilization of the respondents are positively interrelated from each other, suggesting that respondents who always perceive the mentioned factors as access barrier to care utilize low level of healthcare services for the past three months. A further path analysis was conducted and revealed that the supply-side determinant with the largest total causal effect on healthcare utilization is approachability while the demand-side determinant with the largest total causal effect is ability to reach. The findings showed better fit of the conceptual model in predicting healthcare utilization. Approximately 93% of the variance in the healthcare utilization is explained by the model. The results of the study may enable policy makers and health planners to identify the different dimensions and aspects of barriers to access to health services, and to devise specific interventions or combination of interventions that can best address these barriers.",TRUE,FALSE,access|barriers|demand-side access barriers|disparities|healthcare|insurance|path analysis|Philippines|supply-side access barriers|utilization,2020-04-19T05:04:01.063425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18T14:31:25.704000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/citation/,d6vbm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9717f5d6973504c1bda0d0/,5e9717f5d6973504c1bda0d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6vbm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d6vbm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d6vbm

We presently live in a world where few states actually declare war on each other or even war on each other. This is because the 1945 United Nations’ Charter's Article 2 states that UN member states should “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”, while allowing for “military measures by UN Security Council resolutions” and “exercise of self-defense”. In this theoretical ideal, wars are not declared; instead, 'international armed conflicts' occur. However, costly interstate conflicts, both ‘hot’ and ‘cold’, still exist, for instance the Kashmir Conflict and the Korean War. Furthermore, a ‘New Cold War’ between AI superpowers (the United States and China) looms. An ASI-directed/enabled future interstate war could trigger ‘total war’, including nuclear war, and is therefore ‘high risk’. One risk reduction strategy would be optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT), which could contribute towards the ending of existing wars and towards the prevention of future wars, through conforming instrumentalism. A critical juncture to optimise peace via the UGPT is emerging, by leveraging the UGPT off the announcement of a ‘burning plasma’ fusion reaction, expected from circa 2025 to 2035, as was attempted, unfortunately unsuccessfully, in 1946 with fission, for atomic war. While this strategy cannot cope with non-state actors, it could influence state actors, including those developing ASIs, or an ASI with agency.",TRUE,FALSE,AI arms race|artificial superintelligence|existential risk|nonkilling|peace,2020-04-16T05:07:41.491363,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-15T14:02:52.689566,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Peace and Conflict",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/citation/,4268q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e97108243016604b5a0478d/,5e97108243016604b5a0478d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4268q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4268q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4268q

Cross-Country Evidence,"This study uses 2009-2015 time-diary data to examine gender differences in daily activities among children and adolescents aged 10-17 in Finland, Spain and the UK (N = 3,517). Gender differences in child time use are strong in all three countries. Boys are more involved in screen-based time and exercising, and girls in domestic work, non-screen educational time, personal care and socializing. The UK shows the largest gender differences in child time use, including domestic work (60% gender gap), exercising (57%), non-screen educational time (35%), screen-based time (31%), personal care (27%) and socializing (21%). Finland resembles the UK in domestic work (58% gap) and non-screen educational time (34%), showing smaller gender gaps in other activities, without significant gender differences with Spain and UK. Spain exhibits the smallest gender differences in child time use, with significant differences with the UK in screen-based time (16% gap), socializing (6%) and personal care (14%).

Of them, the skepticism about personal identity advanced by David Hume is still sending us an important message. Dealing with the notion of personal identity, he introduced the three relations of resemblance, contiguity, and causation, but renounced them as having any objective basis from which to develop them into viable principles for explaining our notions of personal identity. However, in dealing with the problem of personal identity, consistency of standards is more important than their objectivity, and the difficulties facing the humanity providing accurate answers to compelling questions such as those about the self and death are basically ascribable to our failure to provide consistent standards. Applying a consistent standard, it becomes clear that non-identity among others and personal identity are incompatible, and this points to the need for a shift of perspective in ethics. This paper concludes that the relations among humans and many different points in time within a self are fundamentally the same, and going one step further, intends to set up a new framework of ethics including a concept of the universal effect of existence.",TRUE,FALSE,David Hume|identity|personality|self|Spinoza,2020-04-16T05:07:41.671427,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-15T14:00:04.966547,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf9|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Mind|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/citation/,4m8j2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e96adcfd69735049bbd9213/,5e96adcfd69735049bbd9213,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4m8j2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4m8j2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4m8j2

This systematic review synthesized the current evidence on the prevalence and correlates of loneliness from empirical studies conducted in India.
Methods: Adopting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, eight major databases and additional sources were searched. Studies were evaluated using following criteria: peer-reviewed journal articles, published in English language, presenting any quantitative form of evidence on loneliness, and studies conducted in India among the Indian population. A meta-analysis of the prevalence studies and narrative synthesis of the overall status and factors associated with loneliness were conducted.
Results: Among 1290 studies, only 13 met our criteria. All the studies reported a high burden of loneliness among the participants. The pooled prevalence among 3169 participants was 41% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18% - 63%). The burden of loneliness was higher among the elderly participants (44%, 95% CI 5% - 83%) compared to younger participants (24%, 95% CI 22% - 27%). Factors associated with loneliness included aging, family structure, marital status, religious practices, group membership, educational attainment, source and level of income, psychological attributes, and comorbid physical and mental health conditions among the affected individuals. 
Conclusion: This review identified and evaluated the status and severity of loneliness and its correlates, which may inform future studies examining complex psychopathological and social dynamics associated with loneliness. Lastly, the current evidence necessitates the development of multipronged interventions to address the risk factors and alleviate the burden of loneliness in India.",TRUE,FALSE,India|Loneliness|Meta-analysis|Social Isolation|Systematic Review,2020-04-16T05:07:41.649525,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-15T13:58:27.158204,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Counseling Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dad|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Applied Behavior Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dae|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Multicultural Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/citation/,x4ctz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e96aabaf135350493d5297d/,5e96aabaf135350493d5297d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4ctz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4ctz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4ctz
