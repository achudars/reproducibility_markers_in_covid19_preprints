Drawing on ethnographic data collected in the saltpans of Se-ovlje (Slovene Istria) and Janubio (Lanzarote--Canary Islands) this article examines informant`s perceptions about the awareness of the importance and the enhancement of the holistic values of both saltpans, as well as the impacts and benefits of tourism. Comparing these perceptions about both cultural landscapes, I try to suggest that the complex fruitfully relations between humans and nature in these saltpans are at odds with the neoliberal logic of nature which exploit and commoditize its resources depriving them of their respective agency. A sustainability to contrast the harmful activities of the market ought to be understood not as a simply isolation and fencing of nature for the sake of conservation, but as a preservation that need to foster the continuity of the deep interactions between human culture and non-human nature which are the core of the cultural landscapes.",TRUE,FALSE,Anthropology of tourism|Cultural anthropology|Cultural Landscapes|Culture-Nature Relations|Enhancement Of The Values|Enviromental ethics|Ethnographic fieldwork|Janubio Saltpans|Sečovlje Saltpans,2019-12-30T17:56:02.116070,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-30T17:55:09.444732,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/citation/,aswct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zg4kj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/relationships/node/,zg4kj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e09e63b1a65e9003c72c89d/,5e09e63b1a65e9003c72c89d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aswct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aswct/,https://doi.org/10.25145/j.pasos.2019.17.048,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aswct

Thus, to what extent Amazonian’s approaches to nature could be considered as a moral philosophy through which the way of conceptualizing nature and its non-human denizens enhances the continuity of life and the intimate relations between entities?

How Strong Norms in Organizations Relate to Contractors' Cultural Integration,"Despite evidence that contract workers are often tightly integrated into organizations' work routines and processes, researchers still do not understand when contractors might be more or less culturally integrated with their organizations. How do the prevailing cultural norms in organizations relate to contract workers' cultural integration? It is unclear whether strong norms are conducive to culturally integrating both regular employees and contractors, workers who may have different cultural preferences, and who differ in status as full versus provisional organizational members. Using data from an employer review website, we examine how norm strength in organizations relates to both contractors' and regular employees' cultural integration. While regular employees exhibit more integration in organizations with stronger norms, we find that norm strength is associated with less integration among contractors, specifically those doing more independent jobs. We also examine whether strong collaborative and strong hierarchical norms appear conducive to integrating contractors versus regular employees. The results have implications for the returns to contracting in organizations, and suggest that organizational cultures face trade-offs in integrating workers across different employment arrangements.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-29T21:32:01.878722,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-29T21:31:52.691108,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/citation/,cxrjy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e08a59e1a65e9004971b1e4/,5e08a59e1a65e9004971b1e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cxrjy/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cxrjy

India’s focus on malnutrition has been since its first five-year plan but the challenge persists. Several studies have identified causes behind the malnutrition, but efforts are made to address those causes, but results are inadequate. This review focuses on understanding the malnutrition from the systems perspective. The paper critically examines the literature to identify the various stakeholders that influence the malnutrition scenario of an area. The focus is on understanding the relevance of having systems thinking approach in dealing with the malnutrition issue. The paper concludes that significant understanding has been built around individual causes and stakeholders’ role in malnutrition. However, the need exists to translate this understanding into strategies that are relevant for the implementers on the ground who have to address the malnutrition issue in context-specific multi-stakeholder interests and demands.",TRUE,FALSE,India|Malnutrition|Nutrition|Stakeholders|System Thinking,2019-12-28T16:43:48.992992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-28T16:43:19.346238,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/citation/,sxz53,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0569d0fbb1ef000cd76c67/,5e0569d0fbb1ef000cd76c67,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxz53/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sxz53/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sxz53

This study is performed to understand the laboratory facility-level gaps that need to be addressed to improve the public primary health centers (PHCs) present in rural areas. The laboratory assessment is performed for governance, financing, resources and services and results are validated with the PHC laboratory performance. The current assessment shows critical gaps in the facilities regarding governance, services, resources and financing required for the laboratory services at the rural primary health care level. Governance and services need to be strengthened the most followed with sustained availability of resources and financing. Poor health status in rural areas necessitates public health response based on health systems.

This was an applied-descriptive survey study. The statistical population was divided into three groups according to the share of tax revenue in 2017 and 12 provinces from 31 provinces selected by cluster and quota sampling. The sample size was calculated using the Cochran formula for a large population of 690 people for each group. A questionnaire was used to collect data. The content validity of the questionnaires was confirmed by the experts and the construct validity was verified by factor analysis. The reliability of the questionnaires was also calculated using Cronbach's alpha (0.925). The data were analyzed using correlation coefficient, mean test and factor analysis using the Structural Equation Modeling in LISREL. The results showed that each of the components of the tax culture of the tax payers was higher than satisfactory.",TRUE,FALSE,Management|Social Science|Tax|Tax Payers,2019-12-28T16:35:22.996559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-28T16:35:01.771885,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/citation/,2dhb3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0407a60236b8000b7caf18/,5e0407a60236b8000b7caf18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2dhb3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2dhb3/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2dhb3
