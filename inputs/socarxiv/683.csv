Elite manipulation theories, particularly the idea of diversionary war, have played a substantial role in the analysis of ethnic civil wars. Some, as  Gagnon (2004), argue that political elites have shaped the perceptions of their population to create the illusion of a threatening outside world. This, driven to the extreme, would then give rise to an ethnic security dilemma and potentially, civil war. Even if violence does not break out, divisive elite manipulation increases the likelihood of self-perpetuating injustices between members of ethnic groups. Snyder (2000) argues that democratizing multi-ethnic states face an extraordinarily high risk of such conflict.

During and shortly after democratization processes, when political leaders are most in need of popular backing, the temptation to seek the support of a fairly well defined ethnic group rather than that of the multi-ethnic demos that existed so far may be strong. Especially if group identities have been reified through institutionalization – as is frequently the case in multi-ethnic societies – ready-made social cleavages may be available for politicians to exploit. However, Brubaker (1998) convincingly argues that political leaders rarely have both the ability and ideal environment to manipulate identities for their own personal need that the theory of diversionary war suggests.

This paper provides an initial analysis of the first in a series of democratization cases in ethnically heterogeneous settings: the Burundian democratization process of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Based on news agency and local newspaper reports, this paper attempts to assess to what degree elites stimulate ethnic hostilities in their bid for political power and to what extend they react to credible already present in the population.",TRUE,FALSE,preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:03.160038,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-12T14:10:23.011000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/citation/,ydy6b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x7uku/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/relationships/node/,x7uku,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/582722d1b83f6901f78e6d6f/,582722d1b83f6901f78e6d6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydy6b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydy6b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydy6b,NA

So, technically, this is not a pre-print as we’re currently considering where to send it for a second go. We *could* put it on an institutional archive but felt that contributing to the growth of SocArXiV (many of us have made use of ArXiv) was a worthwhile cause.]

In 1970 John Goddard published an analysis of taxi journeys in central London which had been collected from a 10% sample of journey logs completed by black cab taxi drivers for one week as part of the 1962 London Traffic Survey. Goddard used the pattern of taxi flows between origins and destinations to extract functional regions from London’s city centre, providing a sense of how the centre was differentiated with respect to its spatial structure. In 2011, we were able to gain access to 3 full months’ worth of taxi journeys captured by GPS across a much wider area. We speculated that these two data sets could be compared, providing a unique opportunity to see how Goddard’s analysis had withstood the test of time.

We come to four conclusions: first, that the complexity of the centre has increased significantly since 1962, although its generic spatial structure still exists; second, that Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a robust method for identifying spatial structure and is perhaps more important as a spatial analysis technique now than it was in the 1960s; third, that spatial structure can be articulated as overlapping regions, something that was only implicit in Goddard’s work but which has become much more significant since; and fourth, that despite large differences between the two flow data sets, it is changes in travel behaviour that account for much of the increasing diversity and poly-nucleation of the centre of London over the last 50 years.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:06.341198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-11T10:13:57.031000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/citation/,jqtwg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q3cbh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/relationships/node/,q3cbh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/582599ea9ad5a10047031d8a/,582599ea9ad5a10047031d8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jqtwg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jqtwg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jqtwg,NA

Academics, we contend, are experiencing a parallel pressure to engage in self-promotional practices, particularly as universities become progressively more market-driven. Academia.edu, a paper- sharing social network that has been informally dubbed “Facebook for academics,” has grown rapidly by adopting many of the conventions of popular social media sites. This article argues that the astonishing uptake of Academia.edu both reflects and amplifies the self-branding imperatives that many academics experience. Drawing on Academia.edu’s corporate history, design decisions, and marketing communications, we analyze two overlapping facets of Academia.edu: (1) the site’s business model and (2) its social affordances. We contend that the company, like mainstream social networks, harnesses the content and immaterial labor of users under the guise of “sharing.” In addition, the site’s fixation on analytics reinforces a culture of incessant self-monitoring—one already encouraged by university policies to measure quantifiable impact.

inauthentically. One explanation is that inauthenticity leads to lower
perceptions of product quality. This stems from the audience's doubt of an
inauthentic actor's capability and commitment to produce high quality
goods. Another explanation is that audiences discount the symbolic value --
or what the good represents -- of goods from inauthentic actors. I
empirically test each of these mechanisms in the craft beer industry.
First, I exploit exogenous variation in consumers' knowledge of craft
brewers' inauthentic identity (whether they are owned by a corporate
brewer) to empirically demonstrate an inauthenticity discount. Next, I
decompose audience evaluations to show that knowledge of a producer's

It is crucial to understand how this accumulated capital is socialized and passed down the generations through a labour that I argue is gendered in nature, heavily reliant on women, and currently under-researched. In this paper I address this gap ethnographically, focusing on the gendered labour that women perform to sustain and reproduce the dynastic projects of elite families. I compare and contrast the symbolically distant categories of mothers/wives (Ostrander 1984) and ""girls"" - young women who socialize on the VIP scene, as defined by Mears (2015). Both groups involve biologically female bodies deeply involved in the reproduction of elites but the categories they inhabit, the selves that are both ascribed to them and which they choose to present could not be any more different. In light of this data, elite London emerges as a social space structured around strong hierarchies not just of class but also gender. I therefore argue that it is essential to understand more about the interplay of these two structuring principles within elite spaces, focusing on the 'invisible' labour performed by elite women.",TRUE,FALSE,Gender|III|IIIWP|Inequalities|Inequality|Institute|International|LSE|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:05.204703,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-11-07T15:47:11.210000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/citation/,ewbmx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/44uhq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/relationships/node/,44uhq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5820a2016c613b01f697e095/,5820a2016c613b01f697e095,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewbmx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewbmx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewbmx,NA
