Although the domain of refusal strategies is one of the very important domains in the pragmatic aspect in English, none of the studies conducted about the English language in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have studied refusal strategies used by people in this region. This study aims to investigate the strategies that different people in Dubai use to refuse promotions by sales assistants in different shopping malls in Dubai. The data in this study was collected during field observations conducted in two shopping malls in Dubai.  The findings in this study show that most participants chose to refuse the promotions non-verbally. They used different refusal strategies such as avoidance, hand gestures, and nodding their heads. Only two verbal refusal expressions were used. The reasons for these findings might be related to different factors such as the different cultural backgrounds of the participants, the level of English proficiency, and the nature of promotions as imposition on people’s privacy. Therefore, in order to enable second language learners to use refusal strategies politely and effectively, English teachers should introduce the different strategies that people might use to refuse offers or suggestions in English.",TRUE,FALSE,English language|refusal strategies|verbal refusals,2018-07-02T13:32:11.676989,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:40:54.692733,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/citation/,jcwt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dwc92/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/relationships/node/,dwc92,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc532fa2409b00119deb33/,5abc532fa2409b00119deb33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcwt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jcwt5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.23,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jcwt5

Teacher Talk (TT) is one of the areas of teaching and learning which is often neglected in classroom research even with its high importance in student learning. Identifying the literature gap on TT in specific sociocultural contexts, this study aims to investigate different types of f-moves in Teacher Talk and their impact on developing students’ dialogic skills in English as Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms in Saudi Arabia. The IRF sequence (initiation, response, feedback or F-move) is considered a common sequence of TT in Saudi EFL classrooms. This study uses Cullen’s (2002) analytical framework which focuses on the third sequence of the IRF and Vygotsky’s (1978) sociocultural theory to explore the emerging themes of TT in Saudi Arabian secondary classrooms. The methodology of the study is a qualitative case study, and the participants of the study are 18 secondary school teachers all share Arabic as their first language. The data was collected through classroom observation, audio-recording of forty-five-minute classroom lessons, and semi-structured teacher interviews. The analysis focused on the discoursal and evaluative role of F-Move. The data analysis shows three F-Move types 1) F-Move Repetition Discoursal 2) F-Move Evaluative 3) F-Move Elaborative Discoursal. The findings point out that these F-Moves may increase student-teacher interaction, identification, and correction of errors, and maintain and guide dialogic conversation/interaction between teacher and students if it is correctly oriented. The data analysis shows examples in which TT promotes students’ involvement and increases their dialogic skills while, on the other hand, when TT reduces students’ potential to participate and consequently reduces the students’ spoken output.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T13:32:11.637840,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:41:06.164335,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/citation/,hk7ct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pd6ya/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/relationships/node/,pd6ya,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc51ed266c2a000ec0f0bd/,5abc51ed266c2a000ec0f0bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hk7ct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hk7ct/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hk7ct

It is mainly connected with the non-homogeneity of the inference action and a huge spectrum of its occurrence in language and speech. The study focuses on the search for the universal and relative to the nature of inference criteria of the classification of inferences in language and speech to penetrate deep into the essence of the discussed phenomenon. In this regard, the paper presents an analysis and discussion of the existing inference classifications on the basis of such criteria as functionality, a vector of action, a level of cognitive procession, inferential relations, etc. The aim of the analysis is to compare the current classifications of inferences, to make a conclusion about possible vectors of the inference actions in language and speech and to find out the universal, cognitive foundation underlying inference occurrences. Taking into account the nature of inference as a way of human thinking, the types of inferences are identified according to such mental operations as comparison, filling in (framing), integration, elimination, deduction, induction on the material of various linguistic resources (texts, utterances, dialogues). The proposed classification requires further consideration on the basis of a broader linguistic material (various types of discourse, utterances involving polysemantic words or phraseological units; the study of nomination processes of complex linguistic units like idioms, derived verbs, compound nouns) and can be modified and complemented.",TRUE,FALSE,classification of inferences|cognitive operations|discourse|situational context,2018-07-02T13:32:11.602205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:41:25.173699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/citation/,u9y3s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2bnxq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/relationships/node/,2bnxq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc5010a2409b00109de52b/,5abc5010a2409b00109de52b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9y3s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9y3s/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9y3s

To generate data for this empirical study, a 5-point strongly agree to strongly disagree Likert-scale questionnaire has been adapted and standardized steps were followed to ensure the reliability and validity of the instrument. Arabic version of the questionnaire was administered to randomly selected male and female Saudi English-major university undergraduates studying at foreign languages department during their regular teaching session to generate data. Descriptive analyses were run to calculate percentages, means and standard deviation. The results inform that the participants of this study prefer to use cognitive strategies the most followed by metacognitive strategies. Socio-affective strategies were reported to be used the least by this group. This trend offers valuable insights into the fact that Saudi English as a foreign language (EFL) learners resort to bottom-up strategies more frequently as compared to the top-down ones. It is recommended that Saudi EFL learners should be made aware of the significance of these strategies to enhance their listening comprehension. English language teachers should provide their students with appropriate skills of how to listen, retrospect on listening process and concentrate on practicing metacognitive and socio-affective strategies during their listening tasks.

Writing in a second or foreign language is undeniably more difficult than writing in the first language. Therefore, it is imperative for teachers to understand that there are many differences between first language (L1) and second language (L2) writing. Second language writing is complexified by the addition of new resources and norms (new structural elements of the new language, new rhetorical conventions, and some other things). On that ground, teachers should select the most appropriate teaching methods and strategies in their writing classes, one strategy that teachers can apply in their academic writing class is Reading to Learn strategy. This study presented information on a teaching strategy named Reading to Learn applied to one group of Academic Writing class. One group was taught using Reading to Learn teaching strategy, with the hope of helping students improve in both their reading and writing skills. This study was conducted in a writing course consisting of 20 students. Academic Writing is the highest writing class before students go to thesis proposal writing at the English Department of UKSW Indonesia. One central question to be answered is: How effective is Reading to Learn strategy when it is used to teach Academic Writing students? Instruments used were pre-test, post-test, direct as well as video-recorded observations, weekly journals, and interviews. In Indonesia, not many studies dealing with Reading to Learn have been done. One study was conducted by Samanhudi and Sugiarti (2013). This study reports the effectiveness of using Reading to Learn program in teaching critical writing to teacher candidates in English Language Teaching Department, Sampoerna School of Education, Jakarta. From the statistical analysis as well as from students’ perceptions, several conclusions can be drawn. First, Reading to Learn is effective to teach Academic Writing. Secondly, not all tertiary students like working cooperatively. Some prefer working individually.

The participants were (40) second-year students of the academic year 2018-2017 from University of Baghdad, Iraq. Moreover, a questionnaire is distributed to know students' opinions about studying stylistics. The final results proved that (1-) pedagogical stylistics tools are of great significance to pay heed to the language of poetry or literary language in general, (2-)the questionnaire shows that most agreed on studying stylistics in the classroom.

However, as the present study on the derivation of syntactic word order (including subject-verb agreement configurations) in Arabic varieties shows, such functional elements/items can take a particular functional dimension within the functional domain they are part of. This study relies on sample examples from the literature on Arabic (the standard variety in particular, but also other varieties such as Tunisian Arabic and Moroccan Arabic – see Jouini, (2014) for typical sentences from these varieties) to demonstrate how functional elements can project as functional nodes or be merged as head or specifier (Spec) elements in the structure of sentences. In the inflectional domain of sentences – or Inflectional Phrase (IP) –, variation in subject-verb agreement configurations in Arabic rests on the premise that a Subject node variably projects giving rise to differing subject-verb agreement configurations. The same is true of the projection of the complementizer domain of sentences – or Complementizer Phrase (CP) – in Arabic, which splits into dedicated functional nodes in the standard variety of Arabic, but not in the modern spoken dialects. These differences in the projection of the IP-CP continuum establish functional relations upon which agreement and movement operations are derived and such notions as ‘topic’, ‘subject’ and ‘focus’ can be represented at the interface.",TRUE,FALSE,features|functional|Standard Arabic|subject-verb|Tunisian Arabic,2018-07-02T13:32:11.453761,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:43:20.619614,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/citation/,auspt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p9rty/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/relationships/node/,p9rty,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4c37a2409b000e9e1ba8/,5abc4c37a2409b000e9e1ba8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/auspt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/auspt/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/auspt

The computer knowledge has begun influencing student’s learning experience for more than 25 years ago, but it was in a moderate manner (Cuban, 2001). However, the past decade has witnessed major trend toward integrating computer technology in all the language classes. The integration has increased because the computer technology represents an accessible and instant information, enormous potential for interactivity and media–rich communication, as well as educational tools which engage the students in the classroom (Mouza, 2002). Undoubtedly the recent advancement in information technology and computer usage in the classroom is rapidly transforming the environment of the classroom. The teachers cannot ignore the reality the today’s classroom must provide technology-supported learning (Angers &amp; Machtmes, 2005). Being prepared to integrate the technology in the classroom has become a paramount skill in every teacher’s professional repertoires. The traditional role of the teacher as the center of the schooling is changing recently with all the introduction of the new technologies in the classroom. One of the effects of the new technologies is the decentralization of teachers in the learning environment (Damrian, 1998). This introduces a very valid point of how the teaching profession will change in the era of digital technologies.  What is the role of the teacher in a classroom where he/she is no longer the only source of knowledge? How can he/ she teach effectively in a class, where every student has his/her computer and can Google any piece of information? The following study will investigate the effect of the implementation of the technology in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classes on the nature of the teachers’ profession.",TRUE,FALSE,|Digital immigrants|digital natives|integration|new technologies Technology-enhanced environment|Professionalism,2018-07-02T13:32:11.416446,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:43:36.418185,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/citation/,rnfjp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uhm75/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/relationships/node/,uhm75,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4b17266c2a000dc10fcb/,5abc4b17266c2a000dc10fcb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rnfjp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rnfjp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rnfjp

This present study examined the effects of extensive reading (ER) on Thai university students.  To measure their attitudes towards comfort, anxiety, intellectual value, practical value and linguistic value before and after 15-week extensive reading.  68 undergraduate students were asked to complete the 5-point Likert scale questionnaire of 23 items adopted from Yamashita (2013).  A semi-structure interview was also employed.  The results revealed students had positive feelings in which ER increased their comfort and decreased their anxiety at the significance level of 0.05.  They also had positive beliefs about the intellectual benefits.  However, the practical value that ER might bring advantages to students’ study or future career was lower in the posttest.  There was no significant difference between the pretest and posttest in their beliefs about English language study benefits.  Qualitative data from the semi-structured interviews showed that students satisfied with their own choice of reading preference.  The findings suggested the use of ER approach in English as a foreign language (EFL) classes to increase students’ positive attitudes, decrease their negative ones towards reading, and develop good reading habits through their reading engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language|extensive reading|reading attitudes|Thai tertiary students,2018-07-02T13:32:11.373479,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:44:05.504763,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/citation/,s64ta,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p6tws/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/relationships/node/,p6tws,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4935a2409b00119de548/,5abc4935a2409b00119de548,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s64ta/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s64ta/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.15,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s64ta

Evaluating this programme, assessment rubrics, classroom observation notes, project presentations and professional development journals (PDJs) were analysed. Precisely, amongst these constructivist evaluative tools, this study aimed to explore the participants’ post-programme learning and reactions through a qualitative content analysis of their reflective PDJs. The revelations of this evaluative analysis about the participants’ learning and reactions would inevitably assess the value of this constructivist programme as well as its effectiveness and help make decisions for its improvement. Additionally, this analysis would significantly confirm the usefulness of PDJs as effective constructivist reflective tools for teachers’ conceptual and practical development.  After being collected, repeatedly read and qualitatively content-analysed, the participants’ coded PDJs (N=14) disclosed themes (N=6) and sub-themes (N=14) reflecting an amalgam of their learning and reactions. This cognitive and affective analysis of the participants’ reflections revealed signs of constructions of different ELT- and PD-related concepts, correction of some misconceptions together with traces of satisfaction, self-confidence and willpower. In the light of this study, the researcher strongly recommends PDJs for teachers to self/peer-assess and develop their teaching concepts and practice, and for programme facilitators to uncover and, therefore, meet teachers’ individual cognitive and affective needs.",TRUE,FALSE,Constructivist evaluation|professional development|reflection|reflective journals,2018-07-02T13:32:11.327170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:44:36.579828,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/citation/,75rxd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ct4py/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/relationships/node/,ct4py,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc4662a2409b00109ddfc9/,5abc4662a2409b00109ddfc9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75rxd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75rxd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75rxd
