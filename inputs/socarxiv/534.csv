Public Support for Countercyclical Government Borrowing,"In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, macroeconomic policy returned to the political agenda, and the influence of Keynesian ideas about fiscal stimulus rose (and then fell) in expert circles. Much less is known, however, about whether and when Keynesian prescriptions for countercyclical spending have any support among the general public. We use a survey experiment, fielded twice, to recover the extent to which UK respondents hold such countercyclical attitudes. Our results indicate that public opinion was countercyclical — Keynesian — in 2016. We then use Eurobarometer data to estimate the same basic parameter for the population for the period 2010-2017. The observational results validate our experimental findings for the later period, but also provide evidence that the UK population held procyclical views at the start of the period.

A fixed effects approach.,"Objective: In this study, we examine how individuals are affected by the change in status to grandparenthood for the first time.
Background: Being a grandparent, especially an active and involved grandparent, is positively linked to the well-being of individuals with grandchildren, however little is known about how becoming a grandparent affects well-being.
Method: We use longitudinal data from fifteen countries in Europe (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe - SHARE) to analyse if becoming a grandparent is associated with three measures of subjective well-being. We use fixed effects models to account for unobserved heterogeneity.
Results: We found evidence that becoming a first-time grandparent is associated with fewer depressive symptoms among women, although there was no effect on subjective life expectancy or life satisfaction. For men, we found no evidence for an impact on any outcome tested, although there is an association with increased subjective life expectancy conditional on employment status; only if men were employed when transitioning to grandparenthood. We also found no evidence that actively looking after the grandchild is important for either gender.
Conclusion: These results suggest that, at least for women, it is the life transition itself that impacts on well-being, rather than active grandchild-care. More research is needed to verify these findings in other contexts, and over longer periods of time.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects models|retirement|satisfaction|well-being,2018-10-15T13:51:02.402672,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-15T13:50:42.441442,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/citation/,29ytg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n7e59/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/relationships/node/,n7e59,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc46357512c03001890d4c5/,5bc46357512c03001890d4c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/29ytg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/29ytg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/29ytg,NA

This essay proposes that most theories of poverty can be productively categorized into three broader families of theories: behavioral, structural, and political. Behavioral theories concentrate on individual behaviors as driven by incentives and culture. Structural theories emphasize the demographic and labor market context, which causes both behavior and poverty. Political theories contend that power and institutions cause policy, which causes poverty, and moderates the relationship between behavior and poverty. I review each theory’s arguments, contributions and challenges. Further, I explain how to integrate, classify studies into, and distinguish between theories. Ultimately, I argue that poverty research would benefit from more explicit theory and theoretical debate, as well as greater interdisciplinarity and integration between studies of the U.S., rich democracies, and developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,inequality|poor|poverty|power resources|social policy|theory,2018-10-15T11:02:01.241656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-15T11:01:40.619645,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",David Brady,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/citation/,jud53,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fdsn3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/relationships/node/,fdsn3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc408a02aa873001bc5b8e0/,5bc408a02aa873001bc5b8e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jud53/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jud53/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jud53,NA

The relationship between this process and children’s rights is, however, rarely acknowledged. The political, social and legal legitimacy of these harmonisation efforts have come under strict scrutiny, but hardly ever from the point of view of children. This article explores the impact of the process of legal harmonisation on children’s rights, and uses the issue of children’s tort liability as a case-study. The legal solutions in this field are analysed and compared, and the academic proposals for harmonisation are assessed.

Spain has been a member of the EU for more than 25 years, however, the assessment of the implementation by Spanish authorities of EU law in this field has remained mostly limited to fairly descriptive analyses of the applicable statutory framework. This article goes beyond that and looks critically into the evolution of this statutory framework and, above all, its judicial application. Besides analysing the Spanish legal framework applicable to the free movement of EU citizens and their family members, this article explores a range of obstacles to that free movement.

These case studies were prepared in support of the Data Management and Use: Governance in the 21st Century project, carried out by the British Academy and the Royal Society. The purpose of these case studies was to stimulate thinking and discussion by the working group, in their deliberations on governance needs for data management and use across all sectors. This publication is an edited version of the case studies presented to the working group.

The case studies aim to give concrete examples of the kinds of social and ethical tensions that arise in contemporary data use and management – and they draw on the sets of social and ethical pairings, detailed in the main report of this project, that were identified at a cross- disciplinary expert workshop held in July 2016. 

They give current and forward-looking examples of the benefits and challenges of data collection, management and use across a range of sectors and the governance needs in different contexts.
Intended as they are solely to inform the working group, these case studies are not presented as the views of either Academy, and are not intended as appraisals or evaluations of any of the governance approaches identified in them..

We find that the size of the indigenous population varies dramatically depending on the measure of indigeneity used, and that using multiple measures captures distinct modes of indigeneity. Using latent class analysis, we find that contemporary indigenous classification clusters around four types, which we characterize as Traditional Indians, Indigenous Mestizos, New Indians, and Non-Indigenous. Traditional Indians tend to be indigenous on virtually all indicators, and they are especially poor, dark, and rural. Indigenous Mestizos tend to speak an indigenous language, but self-identification as indigenous is tenuous. New Indians assert an indigenous identity despite their frequent lack of linguistic knowledge and close indigenous ancestry, and
they are as urban, educated, and light-skinned as the Non-Indigenous. The analysis addresses sociological concepts of ethnic boundaries, assimilation, mestizaje, and symbolic
ethnicity and discusses the implications of distinct modes of indigenous ethnicity.",TRUE,FALSE,Identity|Indigenous|Latin America|Race and Ethnicity,2018-10-14T14:32:21.220075,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:32:12.301446,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/citation/,pka2y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cm2dz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/relationships/node/,cm2dz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc34d82512c030019902e92/,5bc34d82512c030019902e92,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pka2y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pka2y,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy091

Although Directive 2004/28 (the Citizenship Directive) has enhanced the system of protection afforded to offending European Union citizens, it still contains a number of cracks that lead to policy incoherence and gaps in rights protection. This is evident in the first rulings on Article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38 concerning the deportation of offending EU citizens. These issues also threaten to transform European Union citizenship from a fundamental status into a thin overlay that, under pressure from national executive power, loses its effect and significance. To be sure, EU citizenship has demonstrated that community belonging does not have to be based on organic-national qualities, cultural commonalities, or individuals' conformity to national values, but the continued deportation of long-term resident Union citizens makes nationality the ultimate determinant of belonging. The subsequent discussion suggests possible remedies and makes recommendations for institutional reform.",TRUE,FALSE,Citizenship Directive|CJEU|Court of Justice|ECJ|European Citizenship|European Union|free movement,2018-10-14T14:51:01.476111,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:50:44.952266,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/citation/,tgqrv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xmqz3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/relationships/node/,xmqz3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc33e0a512c03001a9033a9/,5bc33e0a512c03001a9033a9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tgqrv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tgqrv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tgqrv,NA
