This research paper was significant because it attempted to find solutions to these problems. 20 male professors, who teach female students Applied Linguistics courses, participated in this study. A questionnaire used as the main instrument for this study to answer the main question of the study: ‘Do male instructors face any difficulties in teaching Saudi female students?’. The tool demonstrated to the participants of the study in the summer term of 2018. The researcher used the Descriptive-Analytical Method to run the study. SPSS statistical method had used to analyze the data. The findings of the study revealed that male instructors faced many problems when they teach female students through Closed-Circuit Television, such as class management, assessment of female students performance, and the use of teaching tools. So, the paper concluded that female instructors should teach female students instead of their male counterparts. In terms of the findings, the study recommended that male instructors should improve their skills to use CCTV by attending training courses and workshops.

It is already being applied partially in most parts of the world, and certificates are issued from well-known universities. The cultural dimension in ELT has gained in importance. As long as English is a lingua franca, the needs of English foreign learners (EFL) are far from obtaining the skills or accent of the language. This study is significant because it tries to check to what extent can the intercultural awareness and writing through the use of WebQuest help the Iraqi learners to better up their writing skills. They need to understand the similarities and differences between their own culture and the targeted language culture, English. Iraqi learners are part of the EFL students, and it is time to start getting the intercultural awareness. This study is aimed to pay the Iraqi learners' attention to the intercultural awareness issues in order to improve their writing skills. Accordingly, an experimental research is conducted on forty-three first-year participants of Al-Furat Al-Awsat Technical University.

Specifically, it examined the attitudes and thoughts of these females toward the application and the effectiveness of using it as a learning platform. The study was set out to answer two questions; the first questions is “How effective is the application Padlet with regard to using a CLT approach to teach English vocabulary skills to Saudi female EFL learners?” while the second one is “What are users’ attitudes toward the online learning platform Padlet?”. The experiment was conducted for two weeks using Padlet. The population size was 50 Saudi females who were level-eight students at the English Language and Translation Department of Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. After inclusion criteria (i.e., the results of an English language placement test) were applied, 30 students were selected for the study; this was done to ensure that the group was homogenous with regard to the level of English skill. The remaining participants then took a pretest; subsequently, the researcher and subjects engaged in seven instruction sessions using Padlet, during which the researcher followed a Communicative Language Teaching approach to presenting English vocabulary. After the experiment was concluded, the participants were given a posttest identical to the pretest in order to assess their knowledge and compare their vocabularies before and after the instructions were provided. In addition, the participants responded to an online survey designed to measure their attitudes toward Padlet. The participants’ scores and mean scores were calculated using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS); specifically, a one-sample t-test and a paired sample t-test were conducted. The findings revealed that the vocabulary instructions given using Padlet were effective at improving the English lexical knowledge of learners. The survey also revealed that the learners’ attitudes toward the tool were positive.

This study aims at investigating how active and influential YouTube can be in the educational process and how it is beneficial for language teachers to enhance the skills of students. The study demonstrates different theoretical frameworks that tackle the employment of technology to enhance the learning/teaching process. It relies on the strategies of Berk (2009) for using multimedia media, video clips in particular to develop the abilities of teachers for using  technology in classrooms. To achieve the objective of the study, the researchers develop a questionnaire and apply it to fourth-year college students, University of Baghdad, to give evidence and to prove the effectiveness of technology in the academic field. The paper examines classes where computers can be employed, and also shows the challenges that face teachers and educators concerning this application. The researchers conclude that YouTube is an essential tool in classrooms as it attracts the attention of students and develops their mentality and creativity. It also helps cover the materials comprehensively, especially language. YouTube brings the fun element into classes, which thereby meet the interests of students. Such findings have a significant impact on the learning process as the students will find the educational environment more encouraging and exciting.

Specifically, this study answers one research question: How does the use of Quizlet influence EFL foundation students’ vocabulary learning at Rustaq College of Education in Oman? The foundation students were exposed to a series of Quizlet study sets containing certain topics taken from their prescribed curriculum. Within these, they learnt a number of vocabulary individually and collaboratively. Pre-and post-tests were implemented to gauge foundation students’ performances and acquisition in vocabulary. Additionally, focus groups were also  conducted to investigate their vocabulary learning experience pertaining to integrating Quizlet into EFL classrooms. The findings revealed that the foundation students’ performances in vocabulary acquisition significantly increased. Although Quizlet has created a challenging and collaborative learning environment, more language skills should be incorporated in Quizlet to help students to learn vocabulary faster and in an interesting way. This study is significant as it can contribute to the English Language Teaching (ELT) literature pertaining to the innovative and technological tools that can enhance students’ language skills in the 21st century.

However, the use of SMPs for English language vocabulary learning is still under-researched, particularly in a Saudi Arabian context. Alzahrani (2016) and Alqunayeer (2016) have underscored the scarcity of research exploring the use and effect of SMPs on Saudi learners’ vocabulary development, and as these platforms are highly favored in Saudi Arabia, the paucity of research makes the current study timely and pertinent. Furthermore, recent studies in Vietnam and Indonesia have recommended that further research should be conducted regarding the use of SMPs for English language vocabulary learning and indeed for learning English as a second language (Indari &amp; Putri, 2018; Tran, 2016). This paper aims to review the research concerning the use of SMPs for vocabulary learning from 2014 to 2018. Out of 50 peer-reviewed articles, only 15 studies were relevant to SMPs and vocabulary learning. It has been recognized that SMPs are effective in improving learner engagement, motivation, and vocabulary development, suggesting that SMPs can be valuable tools and resources to facilitate learning.

The main question of this study is: how does the pedagogic video contribute to improving English learner’s language skills? This study is beneficial for university teachers who teach content courses to Saudi students using specialized online video courses, science animations, presentations, and online video lectures. The review suggests that teachers must engage in continuous proficiency development as well as self-discovery for overcoming the challenges that impair their learning and development. The use of videos is important as it can increase students’ retention ability, through visual support and comprehension of the spoken discourse. ESP should not be regarded as an important aid to the teaching, rather it should be used as a component of an integrated skills package.

This mixed-method research included sixty (n=60) undergraduate students at the Department. of English Language and Literature at Mu’tah University in Jordan. The participants of the research were selected using purposive sampling method. The data of the research were collected using written essays and interviews. The data was analyzed using SPSS. The data was collected using analytical scale Jacob et al., (1981) to measure the quality of argumentative essays. The result of this research showed that there was a weak negative but irrelevant correlation between writing quality and the frequency of conjunctions as cohesive devices. This correlation indicates that the frequent and general use of devices in the writing of Jordanian students did not contribute to the quality of the writing under any conditions. Also the finding revealed that there is an extremely negative but irrelevant correlation between the use of conjunctions devices by Jordanian EFL students and their writing quality. Therefore, the correlation was negative and insignificant for Jordanian EFL students. More specifically, the result shows that the frequencies of conjunctions were not found as an indicator of good writing quality for Jordanian EFL students. This research is significant for providing a considerable number of pedagogical implications for further research that will offer great contribution to the field of teaching writing in EFL setting in Jordan in particular and English as second language (ESL) context in general. Moreover, the research has shown a better understanding of cohesive devices / conjunctions by Jordanian EFL students at Mu’tah University.",TRUE,FALSE,Argumentative essays|cohesive device|conjunction|English as a foreign language|Jordanian undergraduate,2020-08-20T15:00:24.577391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T14:59:46.015967,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/citation/,v94ya,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3e0b49746a81003b1a370c/,5f3e0b49746a81003b1a370c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v94ya/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v94ya/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v94ya

The discourse for communication online is important for a successful course. In this study, the online discussion board assignment of a college graduate course was analyzed for the discourse patterns based on Vygotsky’s Cultural-historical theories that are more pragmatic than linguistics (Wertsch, 1990) and miss communication between students (Forman &amp; McCormick, 1995). The course was taught and communicated in all-English. Participants are first-year graduate students in one Normal University in Northern Jiangsu Province in China. Data were generated based on a discourse analysis qualitative research and analyzed using the histogram and qualitative discourse pattern analysis. Findings for the histogram showed a late assignment submission, while more than half of students submitted during the final three days while having 11 days to finish. Patterns of responding were discussed in ""questions with most responses"" and ""questions with no response."" The open-ended questions allow respondents to utilize knowledge previously acquired as mediation for further discussions, while close-ended questions received a pattern of the contribution of degrading. Questions with no responses were mostly posted during the final two days. The discourse pattern of online discussion boards, thus manifested itself as a mediation tool for idea exchange not only online for peer evaluation but also self-evaluation.",TRUE,FALSE,CALL|Cultural-historical Theory|EFL|Online Discussion Board|Vygotsky,2020-08-20T15:00:52.059609,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T15:00:05.077011,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/citation/,sfdpj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3e0a81746a81003b1a3592/,5f3e0a81746a81003b1a3592,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sfdpj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sfdpj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.18,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sfdpj

The study aims to evaluate students’ perceptions and preferences towards the three components of a blended learning environment: multimedia learning materials, assessment, and interactive activities. A mixed-method of research design is used to collect the data. Quantitative data is collected in the form of 12 Likert items in which 22 Saudi students are asked to evaluate their learning experiences in three categories of the blended learning environment. These categories are multimedia learning materials, assessment, and interactive activities in a blended course on Blackboard, a virtual learning platform used by the University of Bisha to support on-line learning. The researcher’s observation is used to decode, and explain the responses of the participants qualitatively. The result reveals that learners prefer illustrated text materials to video, plain text and audio materials, flexible assessments to non-flexible assessment, and embedded communication tools like WhatsApp, blogging, wikis, collaborative activities, and discussion forum.",TRUE,FALSE,|blended learning|instructional design|learning design|learning environment|Saudi students,2020-08-20T15:06:07.754021,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T15:04:11.952006,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/citation/,sjzve,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3e0633f57915002bea5c42/,5f3e0633f57915002bea5c42,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjzve/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjzve/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sjzve
