deposits located in river bed and in urban areas is discharged, irregular,
untreated sewage. The Cuejdiu River is a tributary of the Bitriţa River in
the left side,
with a total length of 24 km. Evaluation of water quality of the Cuejdiu
River was achieved by processing the results obtained from tests analyzed
for 30 samples, taken on March 17, 2012, between the mouth of the River
Bestriţa and up
to the exit of the village Cuiejdi. Analysis of water samples was performed
in the laboratory of the Department of Geography, at the Faculty of
Geography and Geology and was taken into account several parameters such as
conductivity, pH, total acidity, nitrates, chlorine. The values obtained
were cartographically represented to highlight differences between the
sector that cross of the rural area and the sector located in the urban
area. Water Management System Neamţ realizes assessments of the ecological
and chemical status of the river Cuejdiu only in urban areas, classifying
water quality in relation to general indicators. Thus, data obtained over a
period of 10 years, from 2000 to 2010, and performing through charts,
helped us to observe the time evolution of water quality in the area. The
impact of human activities is evident in both urban and rural areas. In the
urban area the connections made by citizens, particularly those who live on
the ground blocks, to the rainwater system, instead of sewerage systems,
lead to the degradation of water quality. As regards the rural area, the
situation is just as difficult, meaning that the waste discharged into the
riverbed changes the chemical composition of water.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,engrxiv|environment|environmnetal engineering|pollution|Preprint|rural|rural areas|socarxiv|water quality,2018-07-02T10:49:05.271407,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T16:37:57.044000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/citation/,ewqhu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mun66/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/relationships/node/,mun66,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578bb467594d9001f4859f26/,578bb467594d9001f4859f26,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewqhu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewqhu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewqhu
