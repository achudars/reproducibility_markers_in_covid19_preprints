The latest installment in the history of educational fair use, the 11th Circuit’s opinion in the Georgia State University e-reserves case, may be the last judicial word on the subject for years to come, and I argue that its import is primarily in its rejection of outdated guidelines and case law, rather than any affirmative vision of fair use, which the court studiously avoids. Because of the unique factual context of the case, it stops short of bridging the gap between educational fair use and modern transformative use jurisprudence. With help from recent scholarship on broad patterns in fair use case law, I pick up where the GSU court left off, describing a variety of common educational uses that are categorizable as transformative, and, therefore, entitled to broad deference under contemporary fair use doctrine.

*Abstract:*

It has been nearly twenty years since section 512 of the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act established the so-called notice and takedown 
process. Despite its importance to copyright holders, online service 
providers, and Internet speakers, very little empirical research has 
been done on how effective section 512 is for addressing copyright 
infringement, spurring online service provider development, or providing 
due process for notice targets.

This report includes three studies that draw back the curtain on notice 
and takedown:

1. using detailed surveys and interviews with more than three dozen 
respondents, the first study gathers information on how online service 
providers and rightsholders experience and practice notice and takedown 
on a day-to-day basis;

2. the second study examines a random sample from over 100 million 
notices generated during a six-month period to see who is sending 
notices, why, and whether they are valid takedown requests; and

3. the third study looks specifically at a subset of those notices that 
were sent to Google Image Search.

The findings suggest that whether notice and takedown “works” is highly 
dependent on who is using it and how it is practiced, though all 
respondents agreed that the Section 512 safe harbors remain fundamental 
to the online ecosystem. Perhaps surprisingly in light of large-scale 
online infringement, a large portion of OSPs still receive relatively 
few notices and process them by hand. For some major players, however, 
the scale of online infringement has led to automated, “bot”-based 
systems that leave little room for human review or discretion, and in a 
few cases notice and takedown has been abandoned in favor of techniques 
such as content filtering. The second and third studies revealed 
surprisingly high percentages of notices of questionable validity, with 
mistakes made by both “bots” and humans.

The findings strongly suggest that the notice and takedown system is 
important, under strain, and that there is no “one size fits all” 
approach to improving it. Based on the findings, we suggest a variety of 
reforms to law and practice.

Note: This is an updated version of the original paper. It includes two new appendices and some minor updates and corrections.

This article presents the results of a global survey of nearly 500 anti-trafficking NGOs in working in 133 countries, and is the first NGO-focused survey of its kind. Based on the results of the survey, we provide an overview of the anti-trafficking NGO sector as a whole, detail the relationship between anti-trafficking NGOs and the US, and account for some of the variation in NGO opinions of US efforts. Notably, we find that NGOs are remarkably satisfied with US-led efforts—despite their acknowledged flaws—and that NGOs believe that American anti-TIP policies are important and, on balance, helpful.

a broad environmental agenda. Eventually the union went as far as
incorporating environmental concerns in collective bargaining and calling
for an end to the internal combustion engine. These actions are
particularly noteworthy because they challenged the union’s economic
foundation: the automobile industry. However, as a closer examination of
the record shows, there was a significant disjuncture between the union’s
international leadership, which pushed a broad vision of labor
environmentalism, and its rank-and-file membership, which proved resistant
to the issue. By the close of the 1970s, the conjunction of economic
pressures and declining power in relation to management led the union to

This prominent failure of China’s “Going Out” investment strategy reverberated globally. Both Western and Chinese accounts frame the event as a pivotal moment in Myanmar’s celebrated reform process, the cooling of China–Myanmar relations, and US–China geopolitical rivalry in the Asia-Pacific. However, my ethnographic field and media research from 2010 to 2015 reveals that the mega-project’s failure does not originally stem from inter-state geopolitics or contested economics and ecology. Through chronological narration, I show how the Myitsone Dam is primarily the casualty of a distinctly ethno-political causality, whereby three nationalisms clashed and the replication of China’s “anti-ethno-political” model of development failed. Though no monolithic Chinese state directs “Chinese Development” overseas, individual Chinese entrepreneurs nonetheless draw from the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC’s) anti-political and state-centric paradigm when facing foreign social worlds. In the particular case of Myitsone, Chinese proponents drew from PRC’s state-nationalist heuristics of “national minorities and state-led development” and “Western anti-China conspiracy,” when facing Myanmar’s ethnic Kachin and Burman nationalisms. State ideological subjectivities of these developers seemed to blind them to the weakness in their own anti-ethno-political strategies, even when those collapsed publicly. I conclude that the Myitsone Dam’s construction will likely not be restarted, despite the hydropower company’s efforts. The Myitsone case also exemplifies how China’s previous historical entanglements in its neighboring regions uniquely disrupt the progress of “Going-Out” in Asia.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:22.491882,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T00:27:28.529000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/citation/,axtz2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fa5ze/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/relationships/node/,fa5ze,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc6b159ad5a1020668d179/,57bc6b159ad5a1020668d179,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axtz2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/axtz2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/axtz2

Americans' Attitudes toward Marijuana and Same-Sex Marriage Legalization, 1988-2014","Marijuana and same-sex marriage are two of the fastest changing and most widely debated opinion and policy issues in the United States. Previous research has examined public opinion on marijuana legalization and same-sex marriage legalization individually, but has neglected to examine these two issues together. We use General Social Survey data from 1988 to 2014 to compare four groups: (1) those who support neither, (2) those who support marijuana but not same-sex marriage legalization, (3) those who support marriage but not marijuana legalization, and (4) those who support both. This study provides four key findings: (1) marijuana and same-sex marriage attitudes have changed simultaneously; (2) most people hold these attitudes in tandem, and there has been a precipitous decline in the percentage of people who support legalizing neither and a remarkable increase in the percentage who support legalizing both; (3) attitudes toward both issues are liberalizing across all social and ideological groups, suggesting a society-wide redefinition of both behaviors as publicly accepted issues of individual autonomy; (4) the support bases for marijuana and marriage legalization vary systematically by sociodemographic characteristics. We conclude that notions of individual autonomy may be increasingly important to the American public and their beliefs about what the government should regulate.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:50.592198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-14T21:29:48.712000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/citation/,qmdc4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wh3m9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/relationships/node/,wh3m9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578804199ad5a101f6f5c496/,578804199ad5a101f6f5c496,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmdc4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qmdc4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qmdc4
