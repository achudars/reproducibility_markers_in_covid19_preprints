We study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on electoral choice based on the case of Germany, one of the countries most heavily affected by the crisis. Our data come from the German state of Bavaria, where local elections were held right at the beginning of the pandemic. The elections took place early during the outbreak when there was still substantial variation in the extent to which individual counties and municipalities were affected by the outbreak. This variation provides a unique opportunity to study the causal impact of an event that would shortly after grow into an all-encompassing epidemic. We provide evidence that shows that the disease spread across the state in a mostly haphazard fashion. This lack of a discernible pattern coupled with within-county estimation of effects and a difference-in-differences strategy allow us to causally asses the effect of the spreading of the virus on electoral outcomes. Our results show that the crisis strongly and consistently benefited the dominant regional party, the CSU, and its candidates. For 3 known cases per 100,000 inhabitants, vote shares increased by about 4 percent. We explain our findings with a strategic-alignment mechanism, whereby voters vote into power candidates that they deem most likely to be able to solicit support from higher levels of government.

Children-performers produce videos featuring implicit sexual imagery to satisfy the demands of an adult fan base, and in exchange for a digital reward. We first report the discovery of several YouTube keywords leading to such content, outlining their remarkable interconnectedness via analysis of search trends over the last decade. Following, we investigate audience-child interactions by semantic analysis of n=1398 comments mined from n=30 videos, revealing the occurrence of collective grooming. We then demonstrate how this phenomenon is sustained and enhanced by YouTube search algorithms. Following, we detail a model framework to contextualise our findings. Finally, we propose specific amendments to the 2018 Online Harms White Paper that might tackle this phenomenon. Our  results  reveal  a  new  form  of  child  abuse, as  of  yet  undescribed,  wherein  the  core  features  of  online  grooming  are  translated  to  social media, the fundamental principles of which act  as  a  powerful  incentive.  Because  the  victim’s  manipulation  is  enacted  collectively,  we believe  that  responsibility  ultimately  rests  with society as a whole.

Flooding and Fertility Choices in Bangladesh,"A growing demographic literature has examined the impacts of climatic variability on human populations. Most of this work has focused on migration, morbidity, and mortality. Much less attention has been given to the effects of climate change on fertility, which represents an important gap given many plausible reasons to expect such effects. We address this issue by examining the relationship between exposure to flooding and fertility in Bangladesh. We link birth records (n=355,532 person-years) from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) with satellite-derived measures of flooding from 2002 through 2014 and estimate statistical models of the relationship between flood exposure and subsequent fertility outcomes. We also conduct secondary analyses of the relationship between flood exposure and four expected causal pathways: women’s marriage, contraceptive use, employment, and health. Results suggest that flood exposure reduces the probability of childbearing, and that this effect operates with a two-year lag. Negative effects are concentrated among women with a primary school education or higher and low-parity women. In contrast, women at high parities (e.g., at or above four) tend to increase their fertility in response to flooding. We find little evidence that observed flooding effects operate through the causal pathways we test, raising questions for future research about the mechanisms that explain our findings.",TRUE,FALSE,Bangladesh|climate change|fertility|flooding,2020-04-12T03:35:41.544768,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:35:25.600552,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Brian Thiede|Joyce Chen|Valerie Mueller|Yuanyuan Jia|Carolynne Hultquist,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/citation/,cz482,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8fbe10d697350271bdba63/,5e8fbe10d697350271bdba63,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz482/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cz482/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cz482,NA

on 4 April, 2020 to track and visualize these massive and
extraordinary expansions of police power and the unequal
patterns of enforcement they are likely to produce. In doing
so, we hope that we can bring to light patterns of police
intervention, to help understand who is being targeted, what
justifications are being used by police, and how marginalized
people are being impacted. More broadly, we hope the
project will inform a larger conversation about the role of
policing in society, to scrutinize public health and police
collaboration, and to focus attention toward the harms of
criminalization. Having an understanding of these patterns in
coming weeks will help inform approaches to actively resist
the logic and practices of policing crisis and disease, rather
than allow them to become widespread and normalized.
Through the acts of identifying, reporting, and visualizing
events related to the policing of COVID-19, the project
offers a living repository of publicly accessible data that can

The prevalence, intensity  and determinants of multiple jobholding in Canada","While traditional labour market estimates indicate little change in the proportion of workers holding multiple jobs in North America, survey instrument deficiencies may be hiding more substantial growth driven by the gig economy. To address this possibility, I test a broader measure of multiple jobholding to examine its prevalence in the Canadian workforce based on two national studies of workers (2011 CAN-WSH and 2019 C-QWEL studies). Almost twenty percent of workers in 2019 report multiple jobholding—a rate that is three times higher than Statistics Canada estimates. While multivariate analyses reveal that the multiple jobholding rate in 2019 was thirty percent higher than in the 2011 CAN-WSH study, multiple jobholders in 2019 were less likely to report longer work hours in secondary employment. Analyses also reveal that having financial difficulties is consistently associated with multiple jobholding in 2011 and 2019. Collectively, these findings suggest that while the spread of short-term work arrangements has facilitated Canadians’ secondary employment decisions, for many workers these decisions may reflect underlying problems in the quality of primary employment in Canada, rather than labour market opportunity.

Communities are frequently described as dependent upon natural resource development, but limited attention has been paid to what that means. In the literature, resource dependence is often treated as over-specialization in, or over-reliance upon, the natural resource sectors. However, the logic of over-specialization conceptually grounds dependence in poor economic outcomes. Thus, a one-dimensional typology of dependence based upon a threshold of the share of development in the natural resource sector---as has commonly been used in prior scholarship---does not fully capture the concept and risks tautology. In this paper I address this ambiguity by formally defining natural resource dependence as over-specialization in the natural resource sectors. I then present an ideal typology and classification scheme for natural resource communities in the United States. The typology has two dimensions---the level of development and the level of economic prosperity---and six mutually exclusive categories---extractive specialized, extractive dependent, non-extractive specialized, non-extractive dependent, hybrid specialized, and hybrid dependent. I classify counties from 2000 to 2015 and find that while extractive dependence decreased over the study period, non-extractive dependence increased.",TRUE,FALSE,Ideal types|Natural resource dependence|Poverty|Rural tourism|United States,2020-04-12T03:33:21.487612,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12T03:33:00.264303,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/citation/,j5skm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xfyug/,xfyug,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8dfc25d6973501c9bd98ef/,5e8dfc25d6973501c9bd98ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5skm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j5skm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j5skm,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12357

Using Google Trends to Track Social Responses to COVID-19","We already know which countries have controlled the spread of COVID-19 better and what “good practices” have enabled them to do so. Eventually, some of these policies could be replicated in other countries. But it is not enough to make a well-informed public intervention. We also need quickly available indicators of how actively populations are responding to the virus threat because current changes in social behaviour could mean significant differences in the spread of the COVID-19 in two weeks (after the incubation period). In this article, Pablo Beytía Reyes and Carlos Cruz Infante explore the potential of Google Trends to quickly track social responses to the pandemic. In all the countries that have reached a downward changepoint in the COVID-19 contagion, an “information saturation peak” preceded it: people were massively searching for information on the subject over 2 to 5 days, and about a week after the peak of searches was reached, a decline in the growth trend of coronavirus confirmed cases could be observed. Does it make sense to associate a Google search boom with a decrease in transmission trends? The authors propose that the frequency of searches is a quick indicator of 1) people’ concerns on the virus, 2) the development of a more informed citizenry on how to avoid transmission and 3) active social response to the virus spread, which generally lead to a downward change in the contagion trend.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|COVID-19|crisis management|digital methods|digital trace analysis|epidemic|healthcare policy|public policy|social indicators,2020-04-08T13:31:45.652362,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08T13:31:16.389482,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/citation/,yndb7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8dc333d697350194bda664/,5e8dc333d697350194bda664,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yndb7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yndb7,NA

Reviewing practices, that is, practices of ordering, defining or delineating scientific fields can be understood as an often neglected, yet prevailing textual practice of community building, particularly in novel and emerging research fields, such as synthetic biology. In this article, I aim to explore the structure and content of review articles as a dedicated scholarly genre in synthetic biology, focusing on the period between 2002 and 2012. Based on a theoretical framework combining approaches from genre analysis and the sociology of translation, I explore the different types of review articles one finds in the field, how these review articles deal with or order research in the field, and how they present the field as a whole. I found that modes of legitimation and presentation have changed during the studied period. While in the beginning, review articles referred to the histories of other fields and disciplines, in the more recent years I found a more narrative mode of legitimation whereby synthetic biology is presented as an engineering field with its own history. I argue that such narrations can be understood as a specific way of community building in science.",TRUE,FALSE,community building|review articles|science and technology studies|scientific fields|synthetic biology,2020-04-08T13:29:05.493095,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08T13:28:40.433175,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/citation/,npfkv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8da35543016601bca04e5c/,5e8da35543016601bca04e5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npfkv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npfkv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npfkv,NA

Established approaches involve turning databases of radiocarbon-date densities into single summary proxies that cannot fully account for chronological uncertainty. Here, I use simulated data to explore an alternate Bayesian approach that instead models the data as what they are, namely radiocarbon-dated event-counts. The approach involves assessing possible event-count sequences by sampling radiocarbon date densities and then applying MCMC to estimate the parameters of an appropriate count-based regression model. The regressions based on individual sampled sequences were placed in a multilevel framework, which allowed for the estimation of hyperparameters that account for chronological uncertainty in individual event times. Two processes were used to produce simulated data. One represented a simple monotonic change in event-counts and the other was based on a real palaeoclimate proxy record. In both cases, the method produced estimates that had the correct sign and were consistently biased toward zero. These results indicate that the approach is widely applicable and could form the basis of a new class of quantitative models for use in exploring long-term human and environmental processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Bayesian Hierarchical Regression|Hierarchical Radiocarbon-dated Event Count (HiREC) Model|Palaeoclimatology|Radiocarbon Dating,2020-04-08T13:28:01.147759,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08T13:27:35.608756,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/yv64t/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,W.
