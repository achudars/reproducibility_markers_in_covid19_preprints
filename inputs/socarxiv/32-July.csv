A second objective is to identify the existence of different vulnerability profiles in the infodemic and to understand the information practices associated with these different profiles at risk of misinformation. The approach adopted is therefore firstly a comparative approach between different types of profile. It is not a question of carrying out a longitudinal study representative of the evolution of the French-speaking Belgian population's experience of the crisis. The CoviCom survey is a four-wave questionnaire survey that was conducted in French-speaking Belgium between 30 March 2020 (i.e. 12 days after the entry into force of the first containment in Belgium) and 29 March 2021. In total, the survey collected 10,148 responses to the four waves of the survey (April 2020 containment, May 2020 decontainment, November 2020 second wave epidemic and March 2021 third wave epidemic).",TRUE,FALSE,Belgium|conspiracy theories|Covid-19|Covid-19 infodemic|Facebook groups|Fake news|health communication|infodemic|misinformation|trust in media|vaccine hesitancy,2021-06-05T18:50:09.791669,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-05T18:49:42.181187,FALSE,NA,no,Data could be made available on request  after signing a data sharing agreement.

Under the auspice that no authentic anticipation of what we may 'have to be' (future) is possible without borrowing from the resources of what we already 'have been' (past) and 'currently are' (present), sociological inquiry has been primarily focused on the relationship of an experiencing person (or persons) within the complexities of past events and present circumstances as a means to reveal insights toward the future of social organization. The reasons for this focus on investigations into past and present time horizons are because they are facilitated by the presence of an observable and material reality consisting of identifiable documents and tangible objects that can be identified, observed, interpreted and measured. Whereas, investigations into the future are working within a different reality status all together, one that does not contain identifiable material and empirically accessible facts, thus making it much more difficult to study in that it is focused on a reality that does not yet exist. Given that only materialized processes of the past and present have the status of factual reality (what is real is observable), conclusions and predictions about future events, which are essentially beyond the realm of the material and observable, remain at the level of the senses, as an aspect of the mind, and are seen as belonging to the realm of the 'ideal' and the 'not the real'.

Based on a content analysis of editorials, advertising campaigns, and 213 online consumer comments between 2014 and 2019, we examine how diversity is showcased: speci!cally, whether images of disability serve to challenge or reinforce negative stereotypes. We !nd that market logics constrain the use of models with disabilities and shape their posturing in advertisements and fashion images. While consumers respond favorably to these images, demanding disability be more regularly and prominently featured, they are often responding to images that are sanitized and na ̈ıvely conceived. Nonetheless, we show how consumer feedback interacts with the production process, which in turn can challenge market logics, providing opportunities for increased representation.

ALL COMMENTS WELCOME* This study is part two of an ongoing investigation into the impacts of the UK’s Covid-19 related school closures on primary science teaching and learning. In part one, conducted during the closures of spring 2020, we found that science teaching had suffered in ways that were likely to entrench inequality in who can access STEM education and careers.
The research reported in this paper, conducted during the second round of closures in early 2021, found that little progress had been made in mitigating science learning loss at primary level, with less than 10% of parents aware of any efforts in this regard. Meanwhile a concerning number of teachers were worried that reversing science learning loss was not a priority for schools, and/or reported that no efforts had been made to tackle this.
Parents felt that in general, home learning in the second closure period was much more effective than in 2020. However science provision, although somewhat improved, was still perceived by many to be disappointing in quantity and/or quality. Teachers were still finding science a challenge to teach, although one major barrier from the first closures, a lack of access to IT, had largely been addressed.
The results show that a lack of ‘catch-up’ activity risks science learning loss being forgotten, while the second round of closures has likely exacerbated the relative learning loss in science over other ‘core’ subjects. Both these effects have negative implications for attempts to interest young people in STEM education and careers.",TRUE,FALSE,covid|covid-19|education|primary education|science education,2021-06-02T17:36:27.335550,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T17:30:59.652909,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/citation/,m5b3v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j7e5v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/relationships/node/,j7e5v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b765209096b7025d640fdc/,60b765209096b7025d640fdc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5b3v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m5b3v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m5b3v,NA

However, the impact of these restrictions on open-air, or street-level, drug markets has been neglected in the study of COVID-19. In this paper, we use data from the state of Queensland, Australia, to explore how COVID-19 restrictions may have impacted the open-air drug market of Fortitude Valley in Brisbane. Using a spatiotemporal generalised additive model (GAM), we find that drug detections did not change in the Fortitude Valley region (despite significant increases across the whole state) but that this finding masked considerable reductions in and around the Fortitude Valley train station as well as in the vicinity Brunswick Street mall. It seems that any COVID-19-related decrease appears to have been offset by increases elsewhere, particularly to the streets north and south west of the main street market. These results highlight the limitations of city-wide aggregate analyses of crime during the pandemic and  highlights the need for future research, including with qualitative and ethnographic methods to better understand the lived experiences of drug sellers/users and the law enforcement officers who policed these areas.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Crime|Drug markets|Drugs|Policing,2021-06-02T17:34:42.977547,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T17:29:13.932011,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/citation/,2x53n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b73d7dcb2a5e0251690023/,60b73d7dcb2a5e0251690023,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2x53n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2x53n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2x53n,NA

A further question is whether monetary incentives matter in this respect. We use the Holt and Laury procedure (2002) to elicit risk aversion, the procedure according to Laury et al. (2012) to measure impatience, a gift exchange game (Charness et al. 2004) to capture positive reciprocity, an ultimatum bargaining game (Güth et al. 1982) to assess negative reciprocity, a dictator experiment (Engel 2011) to gauge altruism, and a trust game (Kosfeld et al. 2005) to assess trust in others. We find no differences between agricultural students and farmers in their risk aversion, whereas the latter are fund to be considerably more impatient than the former. Positive and negative reciprocity is slightly more pronounced with farmers. Findings regarding altruism in the two groups are mixed and trust is somewhat more pronounced with farmers. The paper challenges approaches that assume that students can be used as standard experimental subjects whose behaviors can be generalized towards other populations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-02T17:35:23.348928,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T17:30:41.038661,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://aspredicted.org/t4ws6.pdf,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,Sven Grüner,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/citation/,psda5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b73bc99096b7026563fa4a/,60b73bc99096b7026563fa4a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/psda5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/psda5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/psda5,NA
