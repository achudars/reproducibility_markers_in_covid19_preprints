Nearly all survivors reported that the level of awareness regarding sexual violence in their communities was limited, with most reporting that they did not successfully access mainstream services, due to concerns about homophobia, transphobia, and racism. To address sexual violence in LGBTQ+ communities, survivors pointed to the importance of friendship and community networks “outside the system,” resource sharing about non-heteronormative violence tactics, and holding batterers accountable for their behavior within LGBTQ+ circles.

Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units to create variables that control for social, economic or political contexts can dramatically alter analyses. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude in the literature and in their own projects. By using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we are able to construct-for all persons in the US-individual-specific contexts, which we group according to the Census-assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual-specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the magnitude of variation in context for an individual with respect to the published measures using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy-a measure of ethno-racial diversity), we find that block-level Census statistics frequently do not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the contextual variables at all three scales. Finally, we show that within-unit variation is greater in some parts of the country than in others. We publish county-level estimates of the SDIC statistics that enable scholars to assess whether mis-specification in context variables is likely to alter analytic findings when measured at any of the three common Census units.",TRUE,FALSE,census data|context|race,2018-07-02T11:39:08.656456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-14T23:56:21.639465,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/citation/,vhmzq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y23xt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/relationships/node/,y23xt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a848f177166bd000eb82303/,5a848f177166bd000eb82303,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vhmzq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhmzq,NA

Background: Individuals on their families for substantial financial support well into early adulthood, even as young adults perceive independence as a key marker of adulthood. Given known variation in transitions to adulthood and unequal exposure to financial precariousness across social groups, the authors ask whether heterogeneity emerges with regards to the timing of financial independence and types of support received, and how differences in pathways to independence may matter for financial security later in young adulthood.

Method: The authors estimate group-based trajectory models of four indicators of financial independence for 1,719 young adults from age 18 - 27 using data from the 2005-2015 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/). These trajectories are then used to estimate predicted levels of financial security at the end of the study period, using logistic and linear regression analysis. 

Results: Results show that paths to young adults’ financial independence are best characterized by four types of trajectories: Consistently Independent (23%), Quickly Independent (41%), Gradually Independent (23%), and Consistently Supported (13%), with types and duration of support varying substantially across trajectories. The authors find that young adults experiencing trajectories characterized by lower levels of familial support also report higher levels of financial insecurity by the end of the survey. 

Conclusion: The findings suggest that the patterning and timing of financial independence in the transition to adulthood has implications for financial wellbeing.",TRUE,FALSE,Aging and the Life Course|Children and Youth|Demography|Family|Inequality|Population|Poverty|Transition to Adulthood,2018-07-02T11:39:08.505649,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-14T19:07:07.545694,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/citation/,t6ar5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sbygc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/relationships/node/,sbygc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8466e795bb7b0010373127/,5a8466e795bb7b0010373127,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t6ar5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t6ar5,NA

Independent of where they occur, the mechanisms of informal governance are expected to be largely defined by the overlapping formal and informal relational structures of these networks. This network theoretic approach yields the hypothesis that timely access to resources such as relevant information and the ability to influence key players within networks should depend on structural positions of actors; their role in the policy process should be constrained and enabled by the structural role they occupy in relation to their direct and indirect contacts. These assumptions will be tested for the case of the ongoing reform of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The central question is whether the structure of the network of European, national and sub-national interest representatives involved in the CFP and the positions of these actors may be used to explain the flow of information during the policy process and the access of actors to these information when they are not yet available to a wider public. In this paper, methods to identify the respective actor population and to measure the relations between these actors as well as ways to uncover information flows will be discussed. First results of the empirical research on network structures in the CFP allowing some predictions on expected information flows will be presented.",TRUE,FALSE,Common Fisheries Policy|European Union|Social Network Analysis|Two-mode networks,2018-07-02T11:39:06.650282,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-13T14:48:56.900627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/citation/,x4r3h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jnkeu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/relationships/node/,jnkeu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a81f86ba5390e001248c2ea/,5a81f86ba5390e001248c2ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4r3h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4r3h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4r3h,NA
