But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 flu illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N=5,018). These surveys were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis but oppose people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological literature on ordinary attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|COVID-19|France|ideology|partisanship|politicization|politics|Vaccination|vaccine hesitancy,2020-05-28T18:45:25.977516,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-28T18:45:04.405209,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/citation/,xphe9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecfca72c7568602b92d2a56/,5ecfca72c7568602b92d2a56,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xphe9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xphe9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xphe9,NA

Yet, little is known about the geographical patterning of drugs delivered through the post. Using a novel law enforcement dataset containing details of illegal drug packages intercepted by UK Border Force en-route to Scotland, we examine the geographical destination of drugs purchased online and explore the area-based characteristics associated with higher rates of delivery. This paper provides previously unavailable insights into the spatial patterning of digital drugs markets at sub-national level.
We use descriptive statistics, Bayesian hierarchical regression models, and spatial autocorrelation to describe the relationship between area-based characteristics and expected rate of illegal drug consignments identified across Scotland.
The majority of intercepted drug packages were destined for urban centres, but there was a higher than expected delivery rate to some of Scotland's remote and rural locations.   Increased rates of drug delivery within Scottish neighbourhoods was associated with higher levels of crime and deprivation, internet connectivity and with access to services, but not with higher rates of drug-related hospitalisation. Analysis of spatial clustering showed that drug delivery to the most remote and rural locations was still associated with good access to services because the packages were typically delivered to addresses in larger settlements within remote locations.
Overall postal drugs delivery reflects both relatively high use in more urban, more deprived areas but also seems to open up more remote regions to drug markets, albeit with usage concentrated in larger settlements within otherwise remote areas.",TRUE,FALSE,Administrative data|Criminology|Cryptomarkets|Digital drugs markets|Drugs|Postal delivery|Scotland|Social and Behavioural Sciences|Spatial analysis,2020-06-01T16:26:30.299477,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30T03:39:20.993700,FALSE,"BM, CD and SM were funded through Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant ES/L007487/1 (Administrative Research Data Centre - Scotland).

As noted by others, the fall in fertility in the post-recessionary period was most pronounced for younger women, suggesting that part of the decline in total fertility may be transitional, as women shift to having children later in their lives. Here, we show that period total fertility rates (TFRs) that adjust for tempo effects indicate little evidence of large declines; in 2017, the adjusted TFR was over 2.1, substantially higher than the observed TFR of 1.77. Importantly, though, we also show that recent declines in fertility are not just the result of declining intensities of first births, but also declining intensities of higher order births. Much of the fertility decline was also driven by reductions in unintended pregnancy and reductions in births to Latina women. We argue that the future of U.S. fertility, therefore, rests on whether those who delay childbearing will ultimately meet their fertility goals, whether averted unintended pregnancies will be made up later, and whether childbearing patterns of Latina women will grow increasingly similar to those of non-Latina women.",TRUE,FALSE,Demography|Fertility|Great Recession|United States,2020-05-28T18:49:05.505447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-28T18:48:21.398169,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/citation/,2u78x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecfafc917ac9e02ca621a4b/,5ecfafc917ac9e02ca621a4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2u78x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2u78x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2u78x,NA

These are the theories of Boltzmann, Gibbs, end Einstein.
The starting point is Carnot’s theory, which defines implicitly the general selection of reality relevant to thermodynamics. The three other theories share this selection, but specify it further in detail. Each of them separates a few main aspects within the scope of the implicit thermodynamic reality. Their success grounds on that selection. Those aspects can be represented by corresponding oppositions. These are: macroscopic – microscopic; elements – states; relational – non-relational; and observable – theoretical. They can be interpreted as axes of independent qualities constituting a common qualitative reference frame shared by those theories. Each of them can be situated in this reference frame occupying a different place. This reference frame can be interpreted as an additional selection of reality within Carnot’s initial selection describable as macroscopic and both observable and theoretical. The deduced reference frame refers implicitly to many scientific theories independent of their subject therefore defining a general and common space or subspace for scientific theories (not for all).
The immediate conclusion is: The examples of a few statistical thermodynamic theories demonstrate that the concept of “reality” is changed or generalized, or even exemplified (i.e. “de-generalized”) from a theory to another.
Still a few more general suggestions referring the scientific realism debate can be added: One can admit that reality in scientific theories is some partially shared common qualitative space or subspace describable by relevant oppositions and rather independent of their subject quite different in general. Many or maybe all theories can be situated in that space of reality, which should develop adding new dimensions in it for still newer and newer theories. Its division of independent subspaces can represent the many-realities conception. The subject of a theory determines some relevant subspace of reality. This represents a selection within reality, relevant to the theory in question. The success of that theory correlates essentially with the selection within reality, relevant to its subject.",TRUE,FALSE,Boltzmann thermpdynamics|Carnot thermodynamics|differential realism|Einstein thermodynamics|Gibbs thermodymanics|selective realism,2020-05-28T18:44:27.928577,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-28T18:44:09.413909,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/citation/,e4qt7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecf56bb17ac9e02a4626b79/,5ecf56bb17ac9e02a4626b79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4qt7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4qt7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4qt7,NA

The current study, employing the bibliometric analysis of 6,903 articles from 1970 to 2019, extracted from Web of Science database, aims to provide an overview of the discipline’s landscape and major scientific domains to facilitate scientific development within the field. Entrepreneurial finance is a young and growing field with exponential growth in the number of publications (with 19.54% per year) and rising collaboration tendency among authors. Journal of Business Venturing is the most prestigious journal, while Sustainability is noteworthy for its rapid contribution to the field.

Besides, using keyword co-occurrence analysis, seven major research domains are identified: “venture capital”, “crowdfunding”, “SMEs finance”, “social entrepreneurship finance”, “financial risk”, “microfinance”, and “human-social-financial capital”.

This recession has been particularly severe for men and women, as they are both experiencing unprecedented levels of long-term unemployment, along with declining wages. Because of the severity of the recession, married mothers of young children may have increased their labor force participation to compensate for their husbands’ under- or unemployment. Using 2006 and 2010 American Community Survey data, I show that married mothers’ increased labor force participation likely occurred in households that were less economically disadvantaged prior to the recession. The demand for married women’s employment should have been stronger in households where men were employed in industries that were hard-hit by the recession. However, employment rates were lower among women married to men with lower earnings who are or were employed in construction and agriculture, the two industries with the highest levels of unemployment. Because their wives were less likely to be employed prior to the start of the recession, they may have been at a stronger disadvantage in obtaining employment in a tight labor market without recent job experience.",TRUE,FALSE,industry|recession|unemployment|women's employment,2020-05-28T17:55:05.169969,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-28T17:54:42.299020,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/citation/,53ag4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecea0ef17ac9e027862274b/,5ecea0ef17ac9e027862274b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53ag4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/53ag4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/53ag4,https://doi.org/10.1108/S1530-3535(2012)0000006010

We theorize that - in addition to incumbency (or success) - exchange takes place through transnational party alliances in the European Union. Relying on party manifesto data and spatial econometric analyses, we show that belonging to the same European Parliament party group enhances learning and emulation processes between national political parties. Estimated short- and long-term effects are approximately two and three times greater when foreign incumbents are in the same European Parliament party group compared to other foreign incumbents.
