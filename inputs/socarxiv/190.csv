This article addresses this critical gap, focusing on Carter’s employment of birds and the greenwood in her story The Erl-King as a metaphor for gender roles and power relations. Hence, the alliance between her ecopoetics and feminist vision forms a case of “ecofeminism.” In her defense of “minor” and oppressed forms of life, Carter makes her caged birds emblems of women imprisoned by patriarchy. Their liberation by the female narrator at the end of the story is not only a sign of resistance but also an indication of the essential harmony and mutual strength of women and nature. Surprisingly though, and before this unexpected end in which the narrator strangles the Erl-King with his own hair, nature is made complicit in the oppression of women rather than simply liberating. This can be explained through Carter’s ambivalent brand of postmodern feminist poetics that rejects fixities and conventional binaries, unsettling the patriarchal myth that women are merely close to nature. Thus, Carter subverts feminist logic by exposing how women and nature are not only closely allied or opposed to patriarchy but also complicit in their own oppression. Moreover, she subverts the woman/nature dichotomy by making the Erl-King the epitome of a harmonious life in nature rather than plainly defending women as expected in feminist texts. Carter deconstructs established myths and conventional gender roles, accounting for subtle female desire in the process of articulating feminist poetics via nature.",TRUE,FALSE,caged birds|Carter|ecocriticism|feminism|imprisonment|nature/woman|The Erl-King,2020-09-12T16:26:47.043403,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12T16:26:27.436946,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/citation/,5axhd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5ae7db1e8b9c007de94ea7/,5f5ae7db1e8b9c007de94ea7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5axhd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5axhd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no3.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5axhd

Many academics, especially women, have experienced unprecedented challenges to scholarly productivity during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The authors analyze the gender composition of more than 450,000 authorships in the arXiv and bioRxiv scholarly preprint repositories from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis reveals that the underrepresentation of women scientists in the last authorship position necessary for retention and promotion in the sciences is growing more inequitable. The authors find differences between the arXiv and bioRxiv repositories in how gender affects first, middle, and sole authorship submission rates before and during the pandemic. A review of existing research and theory outlines potential mechanisms underlying this widening gender gap in productivity during COVID-19.

They were comprehensively studied in the Palaeolithic of Europe and Africa. However, systematic studies of raw material sourcing have not been undertaken for the Palaeolithic of Kazakhstan, such surveys being embedded in reconnaissance works aimed at discovering new Palaeolithic sites. Our study presents preliminary results of the first lithic raw material survey in Kazakhstan. The study is based on outcrop surveying, collecting and sampling of potential sources of raw materials, and on a substantial literature review. The current study distinguishes the geographic patterns of land-use and their correlation with the lithic assemblages from stratified sites. Here, we describe primary and secondary sources of raw materials, and compare them macroscopically with the assemblages of stone tools. The survey results show a heterogeneous distribution of raw materials throughout the study regions. Macroscopic observations of lithic assemblages, and data extracted from literature suggest that hominins primarily selected locally occurring raw materials.

principles. Two hands-on activities for librarians of the Barcelona Network of Public Libraries were ideated and implemented. One was a training course for 30 librarians from 24 libraries. The training empowered the librarians and allowed them to envisage citizen science tailormade implementation in each library. The second activity consisted of the co-creation of a citizen social science project. 40 library users, 7 librarians from 3 different cities, and professional scientists, were involved. Before, during and after the activities, we listened to librarians and users with participant observation, surveys, and a focus group to identify strengths and challenges. The potential of citizen science at public libraries, and especially its co-created citizen social science format, lays within a more social dimension that allows to strengthen social bonds among participants and
acquire better knowledge of the environment.

Using data from the UNESCO school data base, the ISSP 2012, and country-level panel regressions, we leverage simultaneous school closures during first-wave Covid-19 lockdowns to estimate the effect of gender ideology on school reopening schedules. We show that societal gender ideology likely has influenced school reopening policies: Societies with more supportive attitudes toward maternal employment have reopened schools significantly sooner, and at higher intensities, than societies with less supportive attitudes toward maternal employment, relative to other reopening measures, and net of infection rates. Our findings suggest a causal effect of gender ideological beliefs on pandemic-related school-closure policies. We test and exclude a variety of potential confounders such as a country’s maternal employment rate, GDP, social spending, and cultural values toward children. We argue that school closures may be perceived as less problematic in countries where more people support the ideal of a stay-at-home mom. Gender attitudes may thus represent a set of ideas that affect policy-makers’ decision-making via a potential gender ideology bias.

They were also successful managers and business owners, always in search of commissions for their workshops.  Indeed, their ability as managers and entrepreneurs were just as important to their success was just as important as their painting talents. This paper develops a theory of the organization of the production of paintings—frescoes and altarpieces—during the Italian Renaissance. I argue that Renaissance artists faced a trade-off between costly delegation and the sacrifice of gains from specialization in the performance of the tasks necessary for executing a painting. Applied to the historical record, the theory accounts for several of features of the organization of this industry: why Renaissance artists dabbled as entrepreneurs; why they performed several duties that did not require any artistic talent; and why they set up firms to aid them in the execution of some tasks while delegating other tasks to independent contractors.",TRUE,FALSE,Division of labor|Firm boundaries|Renaissance art|Specialization,2020-09-11T09:19:01.688951,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-11T09:18:46.046528,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization,Ennio E.

To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID-19 death surveillance.
Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID-19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average–based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead.
Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020.
Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper-based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID-19 death counts and mortality surveillance.
Public Health Implications. Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19-Like-Illness (CLI) Death|Mortality Surveillance|Newspaper-based Surveillance|Official Hospital Data,2020-09-11T09:20:00.916704,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-11T09:19:38.649138,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/mazbahulahamad,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/citation/,mwd7q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f592c779fdada02729eee84/,5f592c779fdada02729eee84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mwd7q/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mwd7q
