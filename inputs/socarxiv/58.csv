In accordance with peaceful conditions, the optimization of SDS is more appropriate if it is directed at the military operations other than war, which in this study focuses on the operation of Hospital Auxiliary Vessel (HAV). There were problems related to the ineffective HAV operation, because it was used for material transportation and border operations. Its operation doesn’t provide public health services in isolated, frontier and outermost areas. The purpose of this study is to analyze and explain the implementation and to formulate strategies to optimize SDS through the operation of HAV in order to support national defense. The research used is descriptive qualitative with a phenomenological approach. The data were obtained from interviews at the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Health and Indonesian Navy Headquarters. The results of the studied that SDS through the operation of HAV was implemented quite well, but the operating time often exceeded the initial plan due to the limited number of HAV and their crew.

All these changes involve complexities and provoke tense debates within Turkish society, some of which can start to be solved through next elections.

Background Nurse migration is a common strategy used to address nursing workforce needs.
Introduction Agreements exist between countries to facilitate nurse migration, however, it is unclear how nurse migrants have contributed to developing the data on which these arrangements are based.
Methods We conducted a rapid evidence assessment to review the available primary research data. The search strategy looked for sources that involve, was developed with or franchises migrant nurses. The papers included were assessed for methodological quality using the SRQR and CONSORT checklists.
Findings The primary research data retrieved produced 4 main themes; migrant nurses are not clearly defined in research, discrimination is often reported by migrant nurses, language and communication competencies are important and structured integration programmes are highly valued by migrant nurses and destination healthcare employers.
Discussion The findings show that migrant nurses are disenfranchised in primary research in healthcare and this is congrunent with wider reports of discrimination. Structured integration programmes improve the experience of migrant nurses.
Conclusion There is a strong evidence for including migrant nurses in all aspects of research.

To study social relationships, network analysis has been increasingly applied to archaeological data to infer interactions and relationships between entities. Statistical approaches to network analysis, such as exponential random graph models (ERGMs), provide a way to test hypotheses about dynamic processes of network formation. However, computational difficulties and sensitivity to uncertainties limit the application of ERGMs. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian framework on ERGMs that enables an efficient computational process, effective quantification of uncertainty, and robust model evaluation of network properties. We tested a hypothesis of social change relative to the arrival of Europeans by studying burial data from Kiwulan, an Iron Age site in northeastern Taiwan. The results indicate a transition among the burials from network ties based on ritual objects to wealth objects, and a more centralized structure with increased social differentiation after the European presence was established in the 17th century. Our case study demonstrates the effectiveness of Bayesian network analysis for archaeological data, and expands the use of burials in understanding the impacts of colonial presence on Indigenous groups in a pericolonial context.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian|burials|computational archaeology|European colonization|network modeling|social change|Taiwan,2021-03-17T16:57:02.217801,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T16:56:49.171730,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/xga6n/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/citation/,3vfea,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xga6n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/relationships/node/,xga6n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60518041ae403d00c997cf8d/,60518041ae403d00c997cf8d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vfea/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3vfea/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3vfea

The current research is Cognitive and analytical and aims to explain the English translated version of poem 16 taken from L’Amitié Bafouée, using schema theory, following Semino’s (2014) proposed approach to poetry analysis. Terminologies advanced by Schank and Abelson (1977), Schank’s Dynamic Memory (1982), and Cook’s Schema Refreshment (1994), will be used in the analysis. The study’s significance is firstly shown through its corpus, i.e. previous works dealing with Si Mohand’s poetry mostly made use of either the French or Kabyle versions. And secondly, through the use of a combination of terminologies advanced by the previously mentioned scholars. The study aims to answer the following main question:  what is the main scene projected by the poem? And the following sub-question: what is the impact of culturally translated metaphors on readers? Results show that nine scripts need to be activated to form the betrayal Scene. Moreover, the use of literal translation in cultural metaphors specifically, led to difficulties in activating appropriate scripts in order to allow understanding to take place. In fact, understanding is determined by the reader’s background knowledge.

The investigation touched upon the sufficiency of this integration and the usability of these tools by the translation students and graduates of these universities in different translation courses and tasks, which contributes to enriching the field of translation technology, due to the scarcity of such studies in the investigated region. The study used a mixed-methods approach to enhance the validity of the data. The results showed that CAT tools have not been integrated effectively yet into the translator-training programs of the universities under study, as not all of them provide CAT courses. While the universities that do, lack some elements which can help to promote the integration of these tools into the programs. As for the usage of these tools, the findings revealed that a significant percentage of the participants do not use CAT tools in their translation tasks, and more than half of them do not use CAT tools in other translation courses.

The study traces the evolution of this new phase as depicted in Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections (2001) and Freedom (2010). It proposes these two works as examples of how over the past two decades, literature shifted from postmodernist fiction’s irony and skepticism that presents novels as “literature of emergency” to ethical objectivism and neo-realism (Franzen, 2002, p. 258). The purpose of the study is twofold. Firstly, it examines Franzen’s deployment of elements such as the subjective perception of truth, self-restraint, control, and knowledge, which he utilizes to understand reality. Secondly, it explores his employment of narrative tools (e.g., omniscient narrator, metafiction, intertextual dialogue) against postmodern fragmentation and deconstruction. By doing so, Franzen, this study demonstrates, reflects post-postmodernism’s core realist ideas that stress pragmatic interactions with the characters and readers’ cognizance of reality and encourage engagement with the narrative’s language to rework the novel’s social and cultural authority. These post-postmodern narratives reference fictional texts, real-life people, and authentic historical events that exemplify various models, simulations, and patterns of reality within and beyond the text, creating a mediated experience that enables communication with and understanding reality",TRUE,FALSE,Freedom|Jonathan Franzen|metafiction|post-postmodernism.|realistic fiction|subjectivity|The Corrections|trust aesthetics,2021-03-17T19:40:09.614075,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:39:38.224545,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/citation/,rmz89,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6051772980460f00cd97f3df/,6051772980460f00cd97f3df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmz89/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rmz89/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rmz89

Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby through Aristotle’s Eyes: Friendship, Gifts, and Commodities","This research explores the interlocked notions of friendship, community, gift, and commodity culture in Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. It seeks to demonstrate that Fitzgerald’s ethical vision of friendship, community, the Bad, and the Good are deeply shaped by Aristotle’s works The Nicomachean Ethics, The Politics, and The Metaphysics. The extent to which Aristotle has shaped the form and contents of The Great Gatsby, a novel rightly described as a classic of its genre and how far the contentious aspect of its gendered and orientalized characterization can be traced to Fitzgerald’s dialogic relation with the Greek philosopher are among certain questions that this research addresses. The approach to the issue and the related questions stated above is eclectic. It draws its paradigms, partly from Bakhtin’s dialogical theory, partly from economic and cultural anthropology, and partly from postcolonial, historical theory of the type elaborated by Said and Fanon.",TRUE,FALSE,1920s America|Aristotle|commodities|community|Fitzgerald|friendship|gifts,2021-03-17T19:40:22.209414,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:39:56.573008,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/citation/,xfnd3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605176875ca6c700c878defd/,605176875ca6c700c878defd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfnd3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xfnd3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.20,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xfnd3

Freud’s division of the human psyche into id, ego and superego is appropriate for the analysis of the rise and fall of the hero in his pursuit to attain gentlemanhood. Four main questions have been addressed: First, what makes up Pip’s id? Second, what are the main components of his superego? Third, does Pip’s ego succeed or fail in striking a balance between his id and superego? In what ways does it fail? And fourth, how does Pip’s ego eventually succeed in striking a balance between his id and superego? The study finds out that Pip’s id is demonstrated through his fascination with high-class lifestyle and relinquishment of common life. It shows that his superego is constructed from the hurdles that prevent him from pursuing gentlemanhood, namely past common life restraints and present high class deficiencies. It also demonstrates how Pip’s faulty ego comes as a result of his frustration at high class lifestyles and resentment of his old common life. The study eventually reveals that two important factors contribute to the success of Pip’s ego: His reconciliation with the past and appreciation of the present in order to have more realistic expectations of the future.",TRUE,FALSE,ego|Freud|Great Expectations|harles Dickens|id|oscillations|superego,2021-03-17T19:40:27.154321,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T19:40:13.046172,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/citation/,krs7j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6051758c5ca6c700c97905d2/,6051758c5ca6c700c97905d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krs7j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/krs7j/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no1.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/krs7j
