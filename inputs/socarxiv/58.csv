This study aims to assess the subjective well-being (SWB) of Indonesian millennials, mainly through their active participation in communities. Active citizenship is a form of social interaction with a blend of activism. It is not purely an act of altruism as individuals are assumed to expect gains from their social networks through civic participation. Therefore, social networks are taken into account as determinants that moderates the effect of active citizenship on SWB. Given the heterogeneous nature of the Indonesian society, socio-demographic determinants of gender, education, religiosity, and place of domicile are also expected to moderate the aforementioned relationship. The research is conducted by incorporating 318 (N=318) respondents of the 19 - 35 years old age group, residing in Indonesia. Data is collected by using non-random and convenient sampling. Result from Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Multiple Regression analysis indicate a significant effect in the association between active citizenship and SWB. Furthermore, network density, education, and religiosity also have direct effects on SWB. With regard to the interaction effect, the analysis result indicates more frequent online interactions moderates the effect of active citizenship on SWB, in comparison to the offline interactions. Moreover, gender is another determinant moderating the association. However, both interaction variables are indicated in negative effect sizes. As implication, some of these finding are to give new insights in the current discussion on subjective well-being among Indonesian millenials, whereas other aspects are to be improved in future similar studies.",TRUE,FALSE,Active Citizenship|Millennials|Social Capital|Subjective Well Being,2020-12-13T15:30:01.202265,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-13T15:29:48.855436,FALSE,NA,no,Data could be retrieved by sending an email to the author,,no,Preregistration could be retrieved by sending an email to the author,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/citation/,hmg9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd33d0c0694b70183f399d7/,5fd33d0c0694b70183f399d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hmg9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hmg9k/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hmg9k

Shils’ aversion to intellectual disloyalty was a constant throughout his adult life, though his speciﬁcally ‘Shilsian’ take on the intellectual and his society would only cohere, in a sophisticated, original, and consistent way, in the late 1950s. The chapter reconstructs Shils’ encounter with the downcast intellectual, first as a precocious reader of Gustave Flaubert, Hippolyte Taine, and, above all, Georges Sorel. It was Sorel’s chiliastic politics of heroic violence which, in its purist clarity, helped disclose the transcendent moral impulse that, to varying degrees, leads intellectuals to judge their societies harshly. When, after World War II, the moral ideal seemed spent even within socialist movements, Shils observed its traces in the complaints of ex-radicals. Society’s loose consensus depends on public belief, he argued, which in turn depends on the social picture put forward by intellectuals.

However, the fragmented nature of private land tenure, the large number of landowners and their heterogeneous socioeconomic profiles can pose significant challenges for conservation initiatives. Landowners’ attitudes toward conservation initiatives can range from rejection to acceptance and participation, which means that some initiatives will be received with resistance, others with consent. Most research dealing with social outcomes of conservation or restoration initiatives addresses regionally specific case studies, but few studies have attempted to derive general trends. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of conservation measures on private lands to develop a comprehensive typology of factors influencing the acceptance of conservation initiatives on private lands. Our results show that conservation proponents, despite their limited potency over socioeconomic and individual factors, can seek to improve the approach used in conservation initiatives, as well as the perceptions of their actions, by shaping institutional interactions to increase conservation measures’ acceptability.

An emerging literature suggests that fertility history, which includes measures of parity and birth timing, may influence cognitive health in older ages, especially among women given their differential exposure to pregnancy and sex hormones. Yet, few studies have examined associations between measures of fertility history and incident dementia in a population-based sample.

Methods
We examined the associations between parity, younger age at first birth, and older age at last birth with incident dementia over a 16-year period in a prospective sample of 15,361 men and women aged 51-100 years at baseline in 2000 drawn from the Health and Retirement Study. We used Cox regression and the Fine and Gray model from which we obtained cause-specific (csHRs) and subdistribution hazard ratios (sdHRs) for incident dementia from gender-stratified models in which we accounted for the semi-competing risk of death.

Results
During the follow-up period (median 13.0 years), the crude incidence rate for dementia was 16.6 and 19.9 per 1,000 person-years for men and women, respectively. In crude models estimating csHRs, higher parity (vs. parity 2) and younger age at first birth were associated with increased risk of dementia for both genders. These associations did not persist after full covariate adjustment. Across all models in which we estimated sdHRs, we observed a positive relationship between older age at last birth and incident dementia for women only.

Discussion
In this population-based, multi-ethnic cohort, we observed limited evidence for an association between measures of fertility history and incident dementia among men and women after adjusting for potential confounders.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive health|dementia|fertility history|gender|parity|post-reproductive health,2020-12-11T17:56:43.604203,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-11T17:56:02.702555,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/rand?_ga=2.205548819.1289191033.1607622617-909983791.1607448162,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/citation/,3fje9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd25fb2f0df5400ca2f4d31/,5fd25fb2f0df5400ca2f4d31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fje9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3fje9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3fje9

One camp suggests that increases in restrictiveness circumscribe the range of activities in which firms can engage and therefore decrease their innovation. The other camp believes that restrictiveness can lead firms to seek out creative alternatives, which could potentially increase their innovation. In order to reconcile these opposing views, we develop a new theory on regulation and innovation. Our theory has two components. First, we suggest that dynamism—variation in restrictiveness over time—interacts with restrictiveness to impact firm’s search behavior. Second, we propose that changes in restrictiveness and dynamism— through their effect on search—shape the nature of innovation that firms produce. To evaluate these ideas, we utilize data on U.S. federal regulations and the patents of 1,411 public U.S. firms from 1973 to 2009. We find that when dynamism is low, firms are more likely to search for new components as restrictiveness increases.

The qualities of the communities people describe as “diverse” (or not),"The term “diversity” is increasingly used in interpersonal and institutional discourse, yet the meanings assigned to this term are complicated and sometimes contradictory. “Diversity” may refer to multiple attributes—ethnoracial, economic, etc. It may also refer to multiple dimensions of the same attribute—heterogeneity, i.e., mixture, or the representation of disadvantaged groups, e.g., the share of Blacks. We analyze a new survey of Chicago area residents to explore what people mean by “diversity,” not when they define “diversity” in the abstract, but when they use it to describe real communities. First, we confirm that respondents are most likely to mention ethnoracial and economic differences when explaining the decision to describe their neighborhood as “diverse.” Then, we examine whether the decision to describe a neighborhood as diverse is predicted by that neighborhood’s objective ethnoracial or economic attributes, in terms of both heterogeneity and representation. We find that assessed diversity is predicted by both ethnoracial heterogeneity and the neighborhood share of Non-Whites. In addition, Whites associate diversity with economic equality. Overall, a neighborhood’s ethnoracial attributes better predict assessed diversity than its economic ones.

A vaccine will be the most effective global preventive strategy to end the pandemic. Studies have maintained that exposure to negative sentiments related to vaccination on social media increase vaccine hesitancy and refusal.  Despite the influence social media has on vaccination behavior, there is a lack of studies exploring the public's exposure to misinformation, conspiracy theories, and concerns on Twitter regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccination. 
Objective: The study aims to identify the major thematic areas about a potential COVID-19 vaccination based on the contents of Twitter data.  
Method: We retrieved 1,286,659 publicly available tweets posted within the timeline of July 19, 2020, to August 19, 2020, leveraging the Twint package. Following the extraction, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling and identified 20 topics discussed in the tweets. We selected 4,868 tweets with the highest probability of belonging in the specific cluster and manually labeled as positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant. The negative tweets were further assigned to a theme and subtheme based on the content
Result: The negative tweets were further categorized into 7 major themes: ""safety and effectiveness,” ""misinformation,” ""conspiracy theories,” ""mistrust of scientists and governments,” ""lack of intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine,” ""freedom of choice,"" and ""religious beliefs.  Negative tweets predominantly consisted of misleading statements (n=424) that immunization against coronavirus is unnecessary as the survival rate is high. The second most prevalent theme to emerge was tweets constituting safety and effectiveness related concerns (n=276) regarding the side effects of a potential vaccine developed at an unprecedented speed. 
Conclusion: Our findings suggest a need to formulate a large-scale vaccine communication plan that will address the safety concerns and debunk the misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading across social media platforms, increasing the public's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccination.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-11T17:56:21.848971,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-11T17:55:08.051686,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,None.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/citation/,vc9jb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd21e140694b700b9f3897c/,5fd21e140694b700b9f3897c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vc9jb/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vc9jb
