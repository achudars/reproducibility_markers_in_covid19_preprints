Policymakers and scholars alike have championed the Universal Basic Income (UBI) as the panacea. This paper examines the shortcomings of UBI in addressing the automation-led large-scale displacement of labor by analyzing empirical data from previous UBI-comparable experiments and presenting theoretical projections showing potential impacts of UBI in relevant living standards and employability metrics among pensioners. We then consider and recommend the retainment of existing means-tested welfare programs while bolstering funding and R&amp;D for more up-to-date worker training schemes as a more effective solution to technological unemployment.

I focus on legislators who represent the same states as deceased legislators: these lawmakers collaborated with the deceased more closely, but otherwise they are comparable to all other lawmakers. Following the death of a legislator from the same state, lawmakers suffer a 16% decrease in their effectiveness.

Even at its best, though, virtual collaboration remains less effective than face-to-face collaboration, leaving millions of workers with both the temporary and permanent challenges of virtual work. Virtual collaboration as we know it was designed in and for a colocated world without prioritizing diverse needs. Design is uniquely positioned to not only alleviate these ails but even make virtual teams strategically advantageous by developing solutions specifically for hybrid virtual collaboration. To do so, designers must incorporate attributes that make virtual collaboration “work”. This article provides background on communication technologies before summarizing the attributes of collaboration and leadership that “work” for effective virtual collaboration.

In this scenario, the logical prediction is a long-term economic collapse by positive loops. In this work, I outline the fundamental idea of a floating taxation system as a feedback system to prevent market collapse by asymmetrical company overgrowth and extreme reduction of system complexity. The paradigm would promote the long-term stability of the economic system. I’ve implemented a generic computational neural network with 5000 virtual companies whose initial states (i.e. capital) and connective weights (trading network) were normally distributed. A negative feedback loop was implemented with different weights. The market complexity was measured in terms of joint entropy in an algorithm to calc neural complexity in networks. Without feedback, some companies had explosive growth annihilating all collateral ones until all system collapses. With feedback loops, the complexity was stable while many companies disappeared (negative selection) and the capital variance substantially increased (from 10 units in initial conditions to 2000 times) as well complexity (increment on order to 104). This data supports a theory about feedback dynamic mechanisms for market self-regulation based on floating taxes, maintaining homeostasis with complexity, capital growth, and competitive balance.",TRUE,FALSE,complexity|complex systems|feedback|floating taxes|homeosthasis|market|modelling|neural networks|stability,2020-09-15T08:20:42.573373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-15T08:20:32.820160,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/citation/,xj2gb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5f9b621e8b9c01a9e96de6/,5f5f9b621e8b9c01a9e96de6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xj2gb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xj2gb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xj2gb,NA

In the case of unemployed people, beliefs about whether they are at fault for their situation or not play a central role in shaping deservingness perceptions. Political actors and lay accounts suggest that living in disadvantaged places can shape attitudes towards welfare recipients. Existing research disagrees on whether higher local unemployment improves attitudes by providing information about the labour market, or worsens them by priming fears of welfare dependency. Thus, this study investigates whether individuals living in areas with higher unemployment benefit claims are more or less likely to believe that the unemployed are responsible for their situation. I innovate using a large sample of longitudinal data from the British Election Study to investigate the role of measuring unemployment benefit claims at multiple spatial scales, and over time. The results provide little evidence of a relationship between local unemployment and beliefs about the causes of unemployment, especially among affluent people. These findings challenge claims that antipathy towards unemployment benefits is shaped by exposure to unemployed people and undermine arguments that spatial segregation by income leads to decreased solidarity with the unemployed.",TRUE,FALSE,deservingness|policy preferences|segregation|stigma|unemployment|welfare attitudes,2020-09-15T08:22:04.577137,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-15T08:21:34.219832,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/|https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/|https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housepricestatisticsforsmallareas/yearendingdecember2019,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/citation/,x79fy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5f89191e8b9c0199e93ff1/,5f5f89191e8b9c0199e93ff1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x79fy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x79fy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x79fy,NA

Typical research questions focus on whether, when, and under which circumstances events occur. In the social sciences, discrete-time-to-event models are popular (Discrete-Time Survival Analysis Model, DTSAM). Data analyzed through DTSAMs is in the so-called person-period format. The model is a logistic regression model with the event indicator as the dependent variable.
     
However, like many other statistical applications, the practical analysis of discrete-time survival data is challenged by missing data in one or more covariates. Negative consequences of such missing data range from efficiency losses to bias. A popular approach to circumvent these unwanted effects of missing data is multiple imputation (MI). With multiple imputation, it is crucial to include outcome information in the model for imputing partially observed covariates. Unfortunately, this is not straightforward in case of DTSAM, since we (a) usually have a partly observed (left- or right-censored) outcome, (b) do not have only one outcome variable, but two: the event indicator and the time-to-event and (c) have to decide whether to impute while the data set is still in person format or after transformation in person-period format, especially if we look at time-invariant information. 

Since there is little guidance on how to incorporate the observed outcome information in the imputation model of missing covariates in discrete-time survival analysis, we explore different approaches using fully conditional specification (FCS) (van Buuren 2006) and the newer substantial model compatible (SMC-) FCS MI (Bartlett et al., 2014). These approaches vary in their complexity with which we incorporate the outcome into the imputation model, the FCS algorithm used, and the data format used during the imputation. We compare the methods using Monte Carlo simulations and provide a practical example using data from the German Family Panel pairfam.

We confirm the results by White and Royston (2009) and Beesley et al. (2016) that imputing conditional on the (partly imputed) uncensored time-to-event yields high bias. A compatible imputation model for SMC-FCS MI with data in person-period format proves to be the key to imputations with good performance results under different simulation conditions.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-15T08:19:51.182976,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-15T08:19:31.696372,TRUE,We gratefully acknowledge funding from the DFG - project number 316901171.,no,Pairfam data (ZA5678 Data File Version 11.0.0) is available from GESIS after registration: https://doi.org/10.4232/pairfam.5678.11.0.0.,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Anna-Carolina Haensch|Bernd Weiß,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/citation/,ptwvq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/txvey/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/relationships/node/,txvey,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5f86832c735501beea0bab/,5f5f86832c735501beea0bab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ptwvq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ptwvq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ptwvq,NA

Systematic study of law and justice has been stymied, however, by lack of basic information: who was doing what, where, when and how? To begin addressing this shortcoming this article introduces the Romanian Judicial Professions Database, a new, open-source tool which provides yearly, person-level data on 10,000 judges, 5300 prosecutors, 3000 notaries public (notari publici), and 1000 bailiffs (executori judecătoreşti), in some cases going back to the 1970s. To illustrate the utility of these new data, I derive a series of measures which address existing findings as well as open questions in four areas of research: the communist legal system, transitional justice, anti-corruption, and social stratification.
