The formal system of aristocratic honor culture was gradually supplanted by a bourgeois concept of reputation rooted in the public perception of individual merits. During this period, dueling was a practice of dispute resolution commonly used in honor groups, and also diffused to bourgeois groups in domains such as politics and journalism. This article explores this cultural transformation by examining duels in 20 European novels and comparing these duels with theoretical and historical work on duels as a social practice. The novels present a significantly distorted representation of dueling. This distortion demonstrates the limited ability of the novel, a bourgeois form, to describe group-oriented values such as honor. This is, in turn, sociologically significant: the novels point to major differences in the social psychologies underpinning honor and reputation, and also anticipate the obsolescence of honor culture well before this occurred historically.

Asking whether tax incentives undermine or facilitate development, this paper investigates tax rates and tax holidays in terms of both economic and social impacts in developing countries 1985-2014 in the largest panel data set ever deployed for this purpose. The collection of new data results in three major contributions to the existing literature. First, the analysis shows that the use of tax holidays has increased over the last decade throughout all four regions surveyed: Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. Second, the analysis finds that the effect of tax holidays on FDI is negligible and decreasing, and importantly, that it does not translate into neither real capital accumulation nor economic growth. Third, the paper then investigates how the revenue losses from tax incentives can mean real differences for human development by analyzing the effect on tax revenues, spending, health  and education outcomes. The paper concludes that tax holidays are negatively correlated with tax revenues, and as revenues decrease, the spending on education decreases. This has real effects, as evidenced by a significant negative correlation with enrollment in primary education. The analysis concludes that tax holidays overall have more negative than positive impacts on sustainable development.",TRUE,FALSE,development|panel data|poverty|public finance|tax|tax incentives,2018-07-02T11:29:45.632415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-14T04:29:32.136221,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/citation/,4sn3k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uwt85/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/relationships/node/,uwt85,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a319f5278cc98000dce6052/,5a319f5278cc98000dce6052,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sn3k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4sn3k/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4sn3k

Yet the implementation of these laws has been inconsistent at best. This article analyzes the case of Nicaragua, which passed a comprehensive law on gender-based violence (Law 779) in 2012. While celebrated by local women’s organizations, Law 779 was subsequently weakened through a series of legislative reforms and executive decrees. This article seeks to explain why state actors in Nicaragua initially supported Law 779 and later sought to undermine it. I argue that in contexts characterized by a high concentration of political power like Nicaragua, transnational governance structures are insufficient to ensure the success of gender violence legislation.

We ask how much of India’s deindustrialization was due to local supply-side forces -- such as political fragmentation and a rising incidence of drought, and how much to world price shocks.

I exploit industrial clustering and sectoral demand growth for identification.  The effect on bilingualism was strongest in import-competing districts and among local linguistic minorities.

The Dynamics and Distribution of Language Populations,"Scholars have conjectured that the return to speaking a language increases with the number of speakers. Long-run economic and political integration would accentuate this advantage, increasing the population share of the largest languages. I show that, to the contrary, language size and growth are uncorrelated except for very small languages (&lt;35,000 speakers). I develop a model of local language coordination over a network. The steady-state distribution of language sizes follows a power law and precisely fits the empirical size distribution of languages with ≥35,000 speakers.

Several institutional developments including the rise of business accelerators, angel groups, and startup competitions, have meant that founders seeking this type of capital increasingly pitch their business ideas to investors in group settings, raising the question of whether the order in which ideas are pitched affects outcomes. Research on order effects in other competitive environments indicates that judges often have high expectations and calibrate their evaluations to the lower average performance of competitors at the beginning of competition, making it difficult for those going early to do as well as those performing later. We test empirically whether this calibration effect is also present for efforts by founders to pitch investors by conducting a field experiment. Entrepreneurs participating in elevator pitch competitions were randomly assigned the position in which they pitched. We find evidence of this calibration effect: investor-judges expressed substantially lesser interest in pursuing investment in the first and second ventures pitched to them.",TRUE,FALSE,entrepreneurship|field experiment|order effects|pitching,2018-07-02T11:29:44.887102,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-13T16:54:09.126151,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/citation/,6rbyx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fhzcm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/relationships/node/,fhzcm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a314ad6fdec39000d61e1be/,5a314ad6fdec39000d61e1be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6rbyx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6rbyx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6rbyx

Making a causal inference about this claim is difficult with naturally occurring data. For this reason, we conduct an experiment in which participants are divided into investors and workers. Workers are assigned status and then perform a real-effort task. Investors make investments after observing workers’ status and past task performance. We find that workers of higher status receive higher investments when status is derived from performance but not when it is randomly assigned.

Making a causal inference about this claim is difficult with observational data. We conduct an experiment in which we vary both whether a purchase of a physical product is publicly visible or kept private and whether the income used for purchase is linked to social status or randomly assigned. Making consumption choices visible leads to a large increase in demand when income is linked to status, but not otherwise.
