As part of a larger ethnographic project, I draw upon over ten years worth of diversity discourse at DU to illuminate diversity’s economization: the process whereby specific formations of economic values, practices, and metrics are extended toward diversity as justification for DU’s efforts. My analysis responds to three questions: (1) how is diversity economized by the organization; (2) how is this economization articulated through organizational discourse on diversity; and (3) how does the economization of diversity potentially reconfigure race and racial subjectivities? My findings reveal three interrelated processes that facilitate diversity’s: diversity-as-investment, diversity metrics, and diversity-as-affective labor. Together these processes congeal and convert multicultural principles and practices into economic ones. Consequently diversity’s economization recasts nonwhite racial subjectivity as human capital for DU and its white publics, minimizing and entrenching existing racial inequality in the process.",TRUE,FALSE,discourse|diversity|diversity regimes|higher education|neoliberal|racial inequality,2018-07-18T13:29:27.990942,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-17T20:17:40.450210,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,James M.

Therefore, in the story world of this anime, characters are dealing with a highly commercialized media convergence themselves.

Building on the 'capital as power' framework, I propose that capitalists earn their income not from any productive asset, but from the legal right to command a corporate hierarchy. In short, I hypothesize that capitalist income stems from  hierarchical power. Based on this thinking, I hypothesize that the capitalist fraction of an individual's income is a gradient function of  hierarchical power (which I define as the number of subordinates under one's control). Using data from US CEOs, I find evidence that this is true. Furthermore, a hierarchical model of the United States that generalizes this data accurately reproduces many aspects of the US distribution of capitalist income, including the relation between income size and capitalist income fraction.   This evidence suggests that the ownership structure of US society is closely linked to the hierarchical structure of firms.

A growing focus on these emission sources has led to the development of carbon offset protocols that could enable payment to farmers for reducing fertilizer use or implementing other nitrogen management strategies.  Despite the development of several protocols, the current regional scope is narrow, adoption by farmers is low, and policy implementation of protocols has a significant time lag.  Here we utilize existing research and policy structures to propose an “umbrella” approach for nitrogen management greenhouse gas emissions protocols for carbon markets that has the potential to streamline the policy implementation and acceptance of protocols.  We suggest that the umbrella protocol could set forth standard definitions common across multiple protocol options, and then “modules” could be further developed as scientific evidence advances.  Modules could be developed for specific crops, regions, and practices.

The concept of Radical Constructivism was coined by Ernst von Glasersfeld (Munich, Germany, 1917 – Leverett, Massachusetts, 2010) in order to highlight the need for a radical perspective on constructivist epistemology, in opposition to any kind of weak or strong realism. Von Glasersfeld aimed to emphasize that knowledge is subjectively constructed rather than objectively perceived through senses. In its original form, Radical Constructivism does not include any tenet about the outside reality, and so does not present a formal metaphysics. It claims that constructivism must be an unconventional approach to knowledge that, without denying the existence of reality, looks at our constructions of experience from a Darwinian adaptation point of view.",TRUE,FALSE,constructivism|cybernetics|epistemology|erns von glasersfeld|giambattista vico|radical constructivism|systemics,2018-07-15T23:26:21.590921,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-15T23:26:01.539143,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/citation/,69ne8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k5yna/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/relationships/node/,k5yna,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b49ac6c25fdcd0011e44477/,5b49ac6c25fdcd0011e44477,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69ne8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69ne8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69ne8

And the institutionalization of creative writing, government sponsorship of the arts, access to audio and video recording technologies, and the digitization of audio recordings, have accelerated the number of poetry readings and provided scholars with greater access to recordings of them. This situation presents profound opportunities for sound studies research, which have been answered by groundbreaking work. However, among poetry scholars, even those who study poetry recordings, the methods of linguistics, and the computational approaches of the digital humanities, are often missing in the study of recorded poetry readings. Our research addresses that gap, and also offers ways to test the rich intuitions of traditional poetry scholarship about poetry reading styles and their evolution.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-13T22:35:21.043500,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-13T22:33:17.113760,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/citation/,5vazx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rtacw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/relationships/node/,rtacw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b48f22825fdcd000fe3cb4b/,5b48f22825fdcd000fe3cb4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5vazx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5vazx/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.022,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5vazx

The lack of waste collection services in such peri-urban communities favored the illegal waste disposal practices particularly prior to EU accession. The extension of waste collection services from main cities to such areas is compulsory in order to mitigate the environmental risks and the public health threats. The paper estimates the amounts of household waste susceptible to be uncontrolled disposed of by peri-urban villages in different geographical areas of North-East region with a particular focus on Neamt county. The paper points out that these rural settlements should receive the same attention concerning the municipal waste management services as the main urban areas. Traditional recovery of waste fractions at the household level (e.g., home composting) should be further promoted in such areas in order to avoid illegal dumping issue and to prevent the landfill of biodegradable waste as requested by EU regulations.",TRUE,FALSE,illegal waste dumping|peri-urban areas|pollution|waste management,2018-07-13T16:39:20.998788,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-13T16:39:00.414625,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",SGEM 2018  ( for publisher version),2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/citation/,b4er6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/58v6r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/relationships/node/,58v6r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b48aa58e3cf560010d4cfa8/,5b48aa58e3cf560010d4cfa8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4er6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b4er6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b4er6
