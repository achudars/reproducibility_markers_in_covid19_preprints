In this framework, our research subject is to determine the effect of objective and subjective characteristics of social status are associated with subjective social status, measured through income, educational attainment, EGP Class scheme and family subjective social status. It is possible to show a bias towards the mean of the distribution of social status, finding cases of sub and overestimation of subjective status. Using linear regression models for each country and country fixed effects for the complete sample (n = 2365) it is possible to show significant effects of income and higher education for Chile and Argentina, effect that is maintained for the three countries. Belonging to the agricultural self-employment (IVc) and agricultural work (VIIb) classes has a significant difference in contrast to the Services Class (I + II). However, this difference loses significance when controlled by the unobserved heterogeneity of the country. The family subjective social status is the most relevant characteristic in predicting the individual subjective social status, the positive effect maintains its significance in all the specifications of the models.

ground for comparison with the work of feminist existential philosopher Simone de Beauvoir’s  The Second Sex,  which was published just a couple of years earlier in 1949. The following exposition of Adorno’s essay and the “Introductory"" and “Independent Woman” chapters in Beauvoir’s  The Second Sex examines how Adorno’s application of Freudian psychoanalytic theory of mass psychology and the modern authoritarian state aligns with Beauvoir’s theoretical dialectic of the man as transcendent Subject versus the woman as immanent Other. The connective thread in both contexts is a hegemonic teleology of dominance. This hegemony is the apparatus and function of both predominately male fascist dictators and sexist social actors who pander to collective entities of followers captivated by the ostensible auspices of the Father-Leader. The following use of the term Father-Leader will be used as a symbolic gesture and catch-all term to simplify the analogy between Adorno’s fascist dictator and the historically paternalistic man. The symbolic authority of the Father-Leader lies in his ability to generate an affect-driven, hypnotic libidinal bond through the mechanisms of identification and idealization with a mass ancillary entity, in this case either a fascist following of a nation or a large majority of the population, thus maintaining social and political privilege, influence, and control.",TRUE,FALSE,adorno|beauvoir|feminist existentialism|feminist philosophy|freudian analysis|group psychology,2019-05-15T11:07:21.194258,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-15T11:06:43.765238,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment,Jules Ostro,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/citation/,znmcq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/64fmg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/relationships/node/,64fmg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdb555b2d1b9e0019a413ad/,5cdb555b2d1b9e0019a413ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/znmcq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/znmcq

That is, we examine whether parental death has an equalizing or exacerbating effect on offspring socioeconomic attainment, and also whether the socioeconomic status of the rest of the family plays a meaningful role in compensating for parental death. Using data on cohorts born 1973 to 1982 we examine five different outcomes, which are grade point average (GPA) at age 16 in high school, the transition from lower to upper-secondary education, the transition to tertiary education, overall educational attainment, and occupational status by age 30. We match families based upon antemortem parental socioeconomic trajectories. Overall, we find mixed results in our between-family regression analyses adjusting for observables, with inconsistent evidence suggesting that losing a parent with very high socioeconomic resources is worse, and some evidence for a protective effect if the socioeconomic resources of the surviving parent and extended family members are at the top of the distribution. Using sibling fixed effects models that adjust for unobservable factors shared within the family, we see zero results for moderation by parents’ occupations, but find consistent evidence that it is worse to lose a father at a younger age if grandparents have higher ranked occupations.

We conjecture that the answer depends on whether credible information about individuals’ toughness is available. When people send credible signs and signals of their toughness disputes may be solved without violence. We use a laboratory experiment in which subjects create information about their toughness and decide whether to take others’ resources and resist in case others’ attempt to take theirs. Subjects perform a potentially painful but safe physical exercise to create information and to determine who wins and loses fights. This, realistically, ranks subjects according to their toughness and implicates toughness, a quality important in real conflict, in fighting.

dynamics of the modern social order. The implications of modern society on the nature of being human in a social world are vast, as demonstrated by the myriad upheavals witnessed since the ‘long’ 19th century2. But what are the implications of modern society on what it means to be a moral  being? How do individualism and social solidarity coexist? The following addresses the complexity of these questions by analyzing Weber and Durkheim’s perspectives on the transition to modern life and the relationship between modern society and the individual. With Marx as a theoretical backdrop, this essay examines how Weber and Durkheim conceived of the problems of modern society by underscoring the dualities that are reflected in autonomy, authority, rationalization, and other dimensions of structure inherent within social organization and interdependence. These concomitant dualities evince the necessary doubleness of the human condition and how it enmeshes society in a “poverty of morality” (Durkheim,  Suicide , p. 387) that is in need of a new moral order and greater social solidarity.",TRUE,FALSE,classical social theory|duality of structure|durkheim|political sociology|weber,2019-05-14T13:01:21.239644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T13:00:40.946922,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Jules Ostro,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/citation/,3uvkr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bc8w9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/relationships/node/,bc8w9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd9da1f2d1b9e001ca25cc8/,5cd9da1f2d1b9e001ca25cc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3uvkr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3uvkr

Woman and desire will then be addressed as a segue into how the character of Desdemona, in Shakespeare’s  Othello,  used her embodiment of love and desire to transcend her body and reach eternal freedom.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|beauvoir|beauvoir and shakespeare|desdemona|female subjectivity|feminist philosophy,2019-05-14T13:00:27.996506,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T13:00:03.434327,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d00|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Feminist Philosophy,Jules Ostro,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/citation/,aq4tp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8vp6c/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/relationships/node/,8vp6c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd9b402db3c0a0018cfa870/,5cd9b402db3c0a0018cfa870,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aq4tp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aq4tp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aq4tp

This study analyzes disparities in attainment of affordable housing between white, black, Hispanic, and Asian households using 2005-2017 American Community Survey microdata linked to county-level ACS 5-year estimates. I test hypotheses regarding the overall disparities between ethnoracial groups, potential limited returns on socioeconomic status and acculturation characteristics for black, Hispanic, and Asian households relative to white households, and the positive effects of high coethnic populations within the county of residence. Results show there are significant gaps between whites and the other groups regarding their attainment of affordable housing throughout the study period. Differential returns on socioeconomic status are also present, with Hispanics and Asians receiving lesser returns on education relative to whites. Hispanics received significant benefits regarding immigrant status compared to other ethnoracial groups. When accounting for county-level ethnoracial composition there is clear evidence that black, Hispanic, and Asian households are more likely to benefit than white households if they live in a county with an increased coethnic population. However, all groups become less likely overall to live in affordable housing as a county’s percentage white decreases suggesting that ethnoracial composition affects both the overall attainment of affordable housing for all groups and the relative disparities between groups within counties.",TRUE,FALSE,Affordable Housing|Ethnicity|Race|Residential Attinment|United States,2019-05-14T12:59:28.633639,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T12:59:00.385881,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,Matthew M.

While sociological theories would predict  inequality to increase following the passage of Right to Work laws, previous research has found these laws to be largely inconsequential for economic inequality. Drawing on power resources theory, I reassess the consequences of Right to Work laws and allow their impact to depend upon local union membership. To do so, I construct unique datasets at the state and commuting zone levels of income and wage inequality, merging data from the Internal Revenue Service, the US census, the American Community Survey, the US Union Sourcebook, the Current Population Survey, and the National Labor Relations Board for years 1939 to 2016. After using two-way fixed effects and instrumental variable regression models to replicate inconsistent results of previous studies, I show that these mask substantial and robust heterogeneity across local areas. Simply put, Right to Work laws are highly consequential when passed in times and places where labor has something to lose. Right to Work laws remove the negative association between labor union membership and inequality, while the consequences of Right to Work passage are greatest in highly unionized areas. In total, results suggest that Right to Work laws work as intended, increasing economic inequality indirectly  by lowering labor power resources. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,income|inequality|labor market institutions|Labor unions|policy|Right to Work|subnational|wages,2019-05-14T12:57:28.481802,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T12:56:58.711617,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/citation/,7qb56,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd97c5b840cae001a708205/,5cd97c5b840cae001a708205,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qb56/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7qb56/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7qb56
