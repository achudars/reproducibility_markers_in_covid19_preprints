It is also more common for physiotherapists to pay attention to cognitive rehabilitation and psychosocial factors. ReAttach is a short-term multimodal intervention combining: a) sensory integration, b) cognitive rehabilitation and c) systemic work.
Recently ReAttach was introduced in the field of neuro-rehabilitation and therefore it is professionally applied by medics (physiotherapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists) and by neuropsychologists as well.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this case-study is to evaluate the effectivity of ReAttach in a patient with CVA by applying the intervention which includes stimulation of sensory integration and cognitive rehabilitation. Can this patient with CVA benefit from ReAttach?
METHOD: Five ReAttach sessions were applied to a patient with CVA in both hemispheres. Also his wife received five ReAttach sessions as part of the systemic approach. Pre- and post- measurements on functional skills, balance, fatigue and global condition were conducted to evaluate results. Follow up after 2 months.
RESULTS: The results of this case-study suggest that by simultaneously stimulating sensory integration, cognitive rehabilitation and influencing environmental factors (ReAttach) a significant positive change can be achieved in a patient with CVA.
CONCLUSION: Although this result is promising, more research is needed to further investigate the effectivity of ReAttach in larger controlled samples in neuro-rehabilitation.

Practical research indicates that ReAttach significantly reduces psychological problems in both adults and children. Theories on ReAttach state that this is done by creating functional schemas, which in turn create more effective coping styles in clients and decrease psychological distress.
Objectives: This article aims to provide a better understanding of ReAttach theory and give insight in the treatment process.
Methods: This is done by linking theory to the treatment process of a young adult (N=1) with symptoms of social anxiety.
Results: The psychological distress in the client decreased from 32 (serious problems) to 12 (no problems).

Anti-transgender bias in individuals may result in widespread discrimination across society.  Survivors of sexual assault often access social services for support in healing from sexual assault and navigating legal options. Social workers, healthcare workers, and support service workers may play a part in creating or reducing barriers for transgender people in their workplace, hospitals, prisons, treatment centers, legal systems, and other social service institutions. What barriers do transgender survivors of sexual assault face and how can social service organizations alleviate these barriers? 
I analyzed 22 archived surveys completed online by transgender survivors of sexual assault using content analysis, which grounds the results and discussion in the voices of transgender survivors themselves. I identified four main categories of barriers faced by transgender survivors when accessing sexual assault support services: interpersonal, organizational, institutional, and intersectional. The interpersonal barriers describe how a transgender person’s perception of self and other influences decisions to engage with support systems and how to act while receiving support. Organizational barriers represent cultures and norms in organizations which create barriers. We found institutional barriers across the healthcare and the legal systems. Barriers for transgender people also intersect with other oppression, such as racism, ableism, and classism. I discuss the barriers transgender people reported, the analysis which categorized these barriers and I use their words to find potential solutions.

To examine plasma concentration of IgA, IgM, IgG classes, and IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 subclasses in children with autism.
 Methods. Infantile autism was diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria. Plasma samples were collected from 35 autistic subjects, and their 21 siblings (biological brothers and sisters)who served as healthy controls. Plasma samples were separated by centrifugation and stored at –20 C until the determination. Plasma immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgA, IgG) and subclasses
 (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) were determined using a nephelometer.
 Results. Plasma concentrations (mean standard deviation) of IgM and IgG in autistic children (1.36 0.31 g/L and 13.14 1.27 g/L, respectively) were significantly higher (p=0.031 and p=0.023, respectively) in comparison with their healthy brothers or sisters (1.20 0.15 g/L and 12.39 0.96 g/L, respectively). Children with autism had significantly higher plasma concentrations of IgG4 (p&lt;0.001) compared to their siblings (healthy brothers or sisters). Plasma concentration of IgA, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 were similar in autistic children and their healthy brothers or sisters. Increased plasma concentration of IgG1 was found (p=0.027) in autistic males (8.06 2.40), as compared with their healthy brothers (5.24 4.13 g/L). Plasma concentrations of IgG (14.28 3.66 g/L), and IgG1 (9.41 2.20 g/L) in autistic females were increased (p=0.012 and p=0.021, respectively) in comparison with IgG (11.07 2.07) and IgG1 (6.37 3.38g/L) in their healthy sisters.

Adults diagnosed with ASD show a lot of comorbidity and overlapping symptomatology with other neuropsychiatric conditions that require specific approaches. The development of ReAttach supports a dynamic special educational model for autism. Indicating the clinical characteristics of ASD as a reflection of the pre-conceptual stage, the ReAttach for autism protocol is characterized by activating the skills that are required for integration, conceptualisation, imagination and coping. ReAttach starts with external arousal regulation by the therapist to obtain optimal environmental conditions for learning. The term dynamic refers to the personal growth that individuals with ASD and patients with other neuropsychiatric conditions have shown. If core ASD symptomatology, such as lack of coherency, monotropic information processing and social communication problems, can be reduced by intervention it is time to embrace a dynamic model for autism.
Objective: The objective is to propose a dynamic special education model for autism and to communicate how indicating the clinical characteristics of ASD as a reflection of the pre-conceptual stage sheds a different light on comparative research of ASD versus neurotypical groups.

Based on a sample of 300 Malaysian listed companies, we found that only 162 companies (54%) use derivatives to hedge their financial risk exposure and only 30% of those companies choose to apply hedge accounting. In addition, this study examines the relationship between company-specific characteristics and the choice to apply hedge accounting. The logistic regression results show that the decision to apply hedge accounting by Malaysian companies is positively influenced by company size and leverage. The implications of the findings are discussed and some conclusions are drawn.",TRUE,FALSE,company-specific characteristics|derivatives|determinants|disclosure|financial instruments|hedge accounting|Malaysia,2018-11-25T16:17:01.904329,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-25T16:16:51.473416,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,Inderscience,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/citation/,npa6v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/amjg2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/relationships/node/,amjg2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bf980e3c21cd8001ba2b162/,5bf980e3c21cd8001ba2b162,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npa6v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npa6v/,https://doi.org/10.1504/IJAAPE.2017.085183,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npa6v

Stefan Collini, writing in the London Review of Books, found himself “experiencing a rare, and wholly unironic, feeling that mixes pride and humility with a dash of wonder” when he considered “generations to come making use of this vast consolidation of scholarly accuracy for purposes of their own which may be barely imaginable to us now.” Taking into account both the hardbound version and what most assume is its digital doppelgänger at oxforddnb.com, Noel Malcolm in The Sunday Telegraph called the ODNB “an astonishing piece of work: a colossal, beautiful, fully functional and utterly user-friendly engine of enlightenment.” Reviewers’ initial responses—awe and astonishment—have, until recently, arguably been the responses most appropriate to the ODNB considered in its entirety. The enormous scope of ODNB, which is the work of roughly 10,000 scholars, runs to 60 volumes in print, and is made up of more than 62 million words, quickly defeats the capacities of even those most eager to praise it.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-11-23T23:31:21.015710,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-23T23:31:04.803759,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/citation/,rbkdh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rw948/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/relationships/node/,rw948,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bf88a75ce0d1e001eeec603/,5bf88a75ce0d1e001eeec603,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rbkdh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rbkdh/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.028,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rbkdh
