I then explore if there is divergence within NATO in the form of differences in public opinion due the level of military spending within each country. These questions fill an important gap in the literature by tying individual level public opinion to questions of burden sharing and free riding within NATO, with the goal of explaining how citizens’ preferences are influenced by their domestic environment.

The brief first examines the macrofinancial risks for African government bond issuers and for central banks that the LSF repo instrument engenders, as well as the developmental impact of a private-finance-led development paradigm that seeks the structural transformation of local financial systems towards bond-based finance. It then fleshes out the “Reform” and “Rethink” approaches to the ECA/PIMCO proposal. A reform of the institutional design of the LSF can minimise these macrofinancial risks.

Social closure and gendered outcomes in Italy,"This article examines how processes of social closure promote persistence at the top of
the occupational hierarchy and how it varies by gender. We focus on the link between
professional closure strategies and intergenerational immobility in professional
employment in Italy. Since Italian professions display the highest levels of service market
regulation across Europe and are the largest occupational group within the upper class,
analyzing the link between professional closure and social inequality is crucial. ISTAT´s
survey on Italian graduates (SPL, 2011), the Origin-Destination association is
investigated at big-, meso- and micro-level with log-linear nested models. This sample
offers in analyzing social mobility at the beginning of professionals’ careers and provide
in-depth explanations of micro-level dynamics of social reproduction. The analyses
indicate that children of regulated professionals have a higher propensity to follow in
their parents’ footsteps (micro-classes). Self-employment functions as an independent
dimension, which strongly increases intergenerational immobility at top similarly for
professionals and larger entrepreneurs (meso- and micro-classes). Finally, it
demonstrates that the combination of specific parental resources strongly facilitates
professionals’ children to avoid social demotion (big-classes).",TRUE,FALSE,Italy|micro-classes|professional regulation|self-employment|social closure|social mobility|upper class,2021-01-25T17:48:22.554435,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-25T17:47:43.850763,FALSE,NA,no,The data are available on request of ISTAT -when ISTAT give you access to data you can publish with these data.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Lucia Ruggera|Jani Erola,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/citation/,8nxz4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600e5edeb6416f01dcb03651/,600e5edeb6416f01dcb03651,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nxz4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8nxz4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8nxz4,NA

It has long been known that Italy is characterised by the highest levels of professional regulation in Europe, but little attention has been given to the link between professional regulation and educational stratification. This paper therefore analyses micro-dynamics of professionals’ social reproduction in Italy. These processes of intergenerational mobility come to light in the first place by linking micro-classes of social origin to fields of study. Using ISTAT’s “Sbocchi Professionali dei Laureati” survey (2011) and employing multinomial logistic regression analyses, this article demonstrates how social selection into highly regulated fields of study is guided by parents’ profession domains; sons and daughters of professionals are analysed separately.

Yet, extant studies have largely focused on the risk factors for suicidal behaviors, not so much on the thought process and the interactions of factors leading up to a suicide attempt. To understand how suicide thoughts arise and persist inside one’s mind, and look for actionable solutions to reduce the risk of suicidal ideation in young adults, the most at-risk group of deaths by suicide. A multifiltering information mechanism called Mindsponge serves as the theoretical basis. Bayesian analysis with the Hamiltonian MCMC technique (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) was run on a dataset of multinational students (N = 268) in an international university in Japan. Item 9 in the PHQ-9 was used to survey suicidal ideation in students. The associations among four main variables, namely (i) suicidal ideation, (ii) help-seeking willingness (informal and formal sources), (iii) social connectedness, and (iv) being an international student, were tested in four models. Social connectedness is negatively associated with suicidal ideation (μ_(ToSC_Suicide) = -0.13 and σ_(ToSC_Suicide) = 0.02), but when the interaction with international students is added, the social connectedness’s effect on suicidal ideation becomes less impactful (μ_(ToSC*Inter_Dom_Suicide) = 0.01 and σ_(ToSC*Inter_Dom_Suicide) = 0.01). Social connectedness on help-seeking behavior among international students is also negative (μ_(ToSC*Inter_Dom_InformalHelp) = -0.01 and σ_(ToSC*Inter_Dom_InformalHelp) = 0.01). Meanwhile, informal help is negatively associated with suicide (μ_(InformalHelp_Suicide) = -0.51 and σ_(InformalHelp_Suicide) = 0.11) whereas formal help is positive (μ_(FormalHelp_Suicide) = 0.08 and σ_(FormalHelp_Suicide) = 0.10). The findings support our assumption on three fundamental conditions for preventing suicidal thoughts: (i) a high degree of belongingness, (ii) accessibility to help-related information, and (iii) healthy perceived cultural responses towards mental health.

First, rates of excess job and sales reallocation over 24-month periods have risen sharply since the pandemic struck, especially for sales. We compute these rates by aggregating over monthly firm-level observations that look back 12 months and ahead 12 months. Second, as of December 2020, firm-level forecasts of sales revenue growth over the next year imply a continuation of recent changes, not a reversal. Third, COVID-19 shifted relative employment growth trends in favor of industries with a high capacity of employees to work from home, and against those with a low capacity.",TRUE,FALSE,business expectations|COVID-19|reallocation shock|Survey of Business Uncertainty|working from home,2021-01-25T15:23:42.416070,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-25T15:21:25.492188,FALSE,NA,no,Researchers interested in the microdata may contact the Survey of Business Uncertainty team at the Atlanta Fed for access.

Subjects had to rate the reliability of several statements within these fields. We find evidence for a monological belief system (i.e., being susceptible to one statement containing misinformation is correlated with falling to other false news stories). Moreover, trust in social networks is positively associated with falling for misinformation. Whereas, there is some evidence that risk perception, willingness to think deliberately, actively open-minded thinking, and trust in science and media protects against being susceptible to misinformation. Surprisingly, the level of education does not seem to matter much.",TRUE,FALSE,False news stories|monological belief system,2021-01-24T18:02:03.219328,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-24T18:01:33.075177,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,Sven Grüner,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/citation/,r3fx7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600dacd375226b0175516655/,600dacd375226b0175516655,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3fx7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r3fx7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r3fx7,NA

Online platforms initially left content consumers to discern for themselves whether information online was true or false. Outright censoring of content followed and then fact-checking. We propose in this paper that misinformation analysis should aim to make clear what is stated by clarifying the propositions and claims in such content. The early philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is relevant for such analysis. Presented here is an online content information quality check model for written (non-graphical) misinformation analysis and prevention. This model is inspired by Wittgenstein’s book Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Applied to Web browsers and online social media platforms, the rating and labelling of content with this model can help users discern content qualitatively, avoid being misinformed and engage more analytically with other users. This Wittgensteinian model can also be viewed as a theory of information quality.",TRUE,FALSE,Information Quality|Information Theory|Misinformation|Online Content|Philosophy|Social Media|Tractatus Logio-Philosophical|Wittgenstein,2021-01-25T15:35:47.056988,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-25T15:24:06.785668,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d52|Education|Language and Literacy Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/citation/,82swk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600ca109b6416f0155b05f75/,600ca109b6416f0155b05f75,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/82swk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/82swk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/82swk,NA
