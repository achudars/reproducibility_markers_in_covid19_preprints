Eine  Vignettenanalyse zur Akzeptanz von Einwanderern,"Vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen Einwanderungswelle untersuchen wir in dieser Vignettenstudie, welche Einwanderer in Deutschland akzeptiert werden und welche Rechte ihnen von der einheimischen Bevölkerung zuerkannt werden. Dabei unterscheiden wir zwischen einem generellen Aufenthaltsrecht, dem Recht auf Arbeit und dem Recht auf Sozialleistungen. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Akzeptanz von politisch verfolgten Personen deutlich höher ist als die Akzeptanz von Personen, die aus ökonomischen Motiven einwandern, dies gilt insbesondere für den Sozialleistungsbezug. Gleichzeitig legen unsere Analysen nahe, dass es eine deutliche Präferenz für Einwanderer mit hoher Humankapitalausstattung und geringer kultureller Distanz gibt. Individuelle Arbeitsmarktkonkurrenz scheint für die Akzeptanz von Einwanderern dagegen eher eine untergeordnete Rolle zu spielen.",NA,NA,attitudes|factorial survey|germany|immigrants,NA,2021-05-01T03:14:10.665648,It's a duplication.

This research presents the results for a study into the use of a gamified reading website, Readtheory.org, that incorporates the use of gamification elements of badges, knowledge points (KPs), levels, and feedback to enhance reading comprehension. Thus, this study examines 50 undergraduate university students’ attitudes, motivation, autonomy and perceptions toward enhancing their reading skills. The data were collected from students’ interviews and questionnaires at YELI in KSA. The findings showed that students’ attitudes are high toward the gamified platform and that the utilization of Readtheory motivates students to read independently using the website inside and outside the classroom.

There have been many reasons given including interference of the mother tongue and over-generalisation of the rules of the language being studied. This research is concerned with the reasons for mistakes but will concentrate on a particular focus, i.e. the mistakes made by English language students regarding the auxiliary verb “do”. This is seen as a particularly difficult area for many foreign students of English language as this linguistic term does not feature in many other languages and is, therefore, a problem for some language students to grasp.It is hoped that reasons for the many mistakes (i.e. omissions, incorrect verb tense, etc.) can be identified and that from this identification, methods can be found to teach this term in a way that will allow students to grasp the concept and retain it throughout their language- learning careers.This dissertation is based on an error analysis of English written performances by students in the Third Grade (equivalent to Ninth Grade elsewhere) of the Intermediate Boys and Girls’ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It focuses on the examination and analysis of the students’ performances in a translation test. This should reveal information about some of the students’ errors in the acquisition of the auxiliary “do”, and other factors which might affect their English language learning. Furthermore, this dissertation seeks to find out whether there are any disparities in the responses of each of the two groups to the translation test which may be attributable to gender.",TRUE,FALSE,acquisition of the auxiliary|comparison analysis.

Students of the experimental group received the descriptive writing skills instructions in nine sessions based on the SRM, two of them were for training.

One mechanism recently proposed for why this occurs is high levels of labor market concentration, or oligopsony. Oligopsony occurs when there are few employers within a labor market and can lead to suppressed wages and a power imbalance between employers and workers. In this paper, we test the moderating effect of labor market concentration on the relationship between natural resource development and per capita income and poverty in rural America from 2010 to 2016. By comparing results between extractive and non-extractive development, as well as manufacturing, we show that labor market power attenuates the beneficial relationship observed at low levels of specialization in natural resources—particularly for extractive forms of development. Further, by finding no significant relationship between manufacturing specialization and economic prosperity, nor any moderating effect of labor market concentration in the case of manufacturing, we demonstrate that natural resource development and labor market concentration have a unique relationship with rural American economic prosperity.",TRUE,FALSE,Dependence|Market concentration|Natural Resources|Oligopsony|Poverty|Rural|United States,2021-04-22T00:26:27.047297,NA,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-21T17:57:45.885200,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/bibliographic_contributors/,mbq9s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/citation/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/identifiers/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/relationships/node/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/files/,607f380ac14695002c391fbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607f380ac14695002c391fbf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbq9s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbq9s/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mbq9s

This study investigated 1) the associations between multiple environmental exposures and depressive symptoms, both in the residential environment and along the daily mobility path, 2) examined differences in the strength of associations between residential- and mobility-based models, and 3) explored sex as a moderator.
Depressive symptoms of 393 randomly sampled adults aged 18-65 were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Respondents were tracked via global positioning systems- (GPS) enabled smartphones for up to 7 days. 
Exposure to green space (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), blue space, noise (Lden) and air pollution (particulate matter (PM2.5)) within 50m and 100m of each residential address and GPS point was computed. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted separately for the residential- and mobility-based exposures. Wald tests were used to assess if the coefficients differed across models. Interaction terms were entered in fully adjusted models to determine if associations varied by sex.
A significant negative relationship between green space and depressive symptoms was found in the fully adjusted residential- and mobility-based models using the 50m buffer. No significant differences were observed in coefficients across models. None of the interaction terms were significant.
Our results suggest that exposure to green space in the immediate environment, both at home and along the daily mobility path, is associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Further research is required to establish the utility of dynamic approaches to exposure assessment in studies on the environment and mental health.",TRUE,FALSE,depression|environmental exposures|global positioning systems|mental health|mobility,2021-04-20T11:18:42.883062,NA,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:40:08.441286,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/bibliographic_contributors/,m6dbf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/citation/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/identifiers/,ygs72,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ygs72/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/files/,607e8f23eb9cc9031c14d7c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e8f23eb9cc9031c14d7c9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m6dbf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m6dbf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m6dbf

The study used the interpretive paradigm to investigate and interpret the perceptions of Saudi postgraduate students and their supervisors in relation to the difficulties they encountered regarding academic writing in English. Therefore, the study adopted a sequential mixed-methods design. The quantitative phase of the research employed a questionnaire whereas the qualitative phase employed semi-structured interviews and document analysis. In total, 275 students completed the prepared questionnaire whilst 15 students, both male and female, and 9 supervisors participated in the semi-structured interviews. The research also used ten samples of written feedback students had received from their supervisors. SPSS descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data quantitatively, and MAXQDA software was used to analyse the data qualitatively. The study identified that Saudi postgraduates encounter a range of difficulties in their academic writing, which were due to several underlying causes. Therefore, to address this issue and to contribute to knowledge in the field, the author of this study devised a theoretical model to assist Saudi postgraduate students overcome their difficulties with English academic writing. The main focus of the current study is to explain this model in detail.",TRUE,FALSE,academic writing|postgraduate students|writing difficulties,2021-04-20T11:15:20.928514,NA,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:39:35.773959,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/bibliographic_contributors/,83n6p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/citation/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/identifiers/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/relationships/node/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/files/,607e669cc29ca802f7eb2997,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e669cc29ca802f7eb2997/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/83n6p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/83n6p/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.34,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/83n6p
