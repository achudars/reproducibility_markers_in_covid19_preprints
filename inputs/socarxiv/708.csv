patent system when a patent covers one component or feature of a complex
product, This situation is common in the information technology sector of
the economy. First, we show using bargaining theory that the threat to
obtain a permanent injunction greatly enhances the patent holder's
negotiating power, leading to royalty rates that exceed a natural benchmark
level based on the value of the patented technology and the strength of the
patent. Such royalty overcharges are especially great for weak patents
covering a minor feature of a product with a sizable price/cost margin.
These royalty overcharges do not disappear even if the allegedly infringing
firm is fully aware of the patent when it initially designs its product.
However, the holdup problems caused by the threat of injunctions are
reduced if courts regularly grant stays to permanent injunctions to give
defendants time to redesign their products to avoid infringement when this
is possible. Second, we show how holdup problems are magnified in the
presence of royalty stacking, i.e., when multiple patents read on a single
product. Third, using third-generation cellular telephones and Wi-Fi as
leading examples, we illustrate that royalty stacking has become a very
serious problem, especially in the standard-setting context where hundreds
or even thousands of patents can read on a single product standard. Fourth,
we discuss the use of reasonable royalties to award damages in patent
infringement cases. We report empirical results regarding the measurement
of reasonable royalties by the courts and identify various practical
problems that tend to lead courts to over-estimate reasonable royalties in
the presence of royalty stacking. Finally, we make suggestions for patent
reform based on our theoretical and empirical findings.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:36.565601,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:45:33.858000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/citation/,akyqz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ngqf9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/relationships/node/,ngqf9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc8bc0594d9001fbd0f3e2/,57bc8bc0594d9001fbd0f3e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/akyqz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/akyqz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/akyqz

they cheaper they become. But a series of technological changes is underway
that promises to end scarcity as we know it for a wide variety of goods.
The Internet is the most obvious example, because the change there is
furthest along. The Internet has reduced the cost of production and
distribution of informational content effectively to zero. In many cases it
has also dramatically reduced the cost of producing that content. And it
has changed the way in which information is distributed, separating the
creators of content from the distributors.

More recently, new technologies promise to do for a variety of physical
goods and even services what the Internet has already done for information.
3D printers can manufacture physical goods based on any digital design.
Synthetic biology has automated the manufacture not just of copies of
existing genetic sequences but any custom-made gene sequence, allowing
anyone who want to create a gene sequence of their own to upload the
sequence to a company that will “print” it using the basic building blocks
of genetics. And advances in robotics offer the prospect that many of the
services humans now provide can be provided free of charge by
general-purpose machines that can be programmed to perform a variety of
complex functions. While none of these technologies are nearly as far along
as the Internet, they share two essential characteristics with the
Internet: they radically reduce the cost of production and distribution of
things, and they separate the informational content of those things (the
design) from their manufacture. Combine these four developments – the
Internet, 3D printing, robotics, and synthetic biology – and it is entirely
plausible to envision a not-too-distant world in which most things that
people want can be downloaded and created on site for very little money.

The role of IP in such a world is both controverted and critically
important. IP rights are designed to artificially replicate scarcity where
it would not otherwise exist. In its simplest form, IP law takes public
goods that would otherwise be available to all and artificially restricts
their distribution. It makes ideas scarce, because then we can bring them
into the economy and charge for them, and economics knows how to deal with
scarce things. So on one view – the classical view of IP law – a world in
which all the value resides in information is a world in which we need IP
everywhere, controlling rights over everything, or no one will get paid to
create. That has been the response of IP law to the Internet so far.

But that response is problematic for a couple of reasons. First, it doesn’t
seem to be working. By disaggregating creation, production, and
distribution, the Internet democratized access to content. Copyright owners
have been unable to stop a flood of piracy with 50,000 lawsuits, a host of
new and increasingly draconian laws, and a well-funded public education
campaign that starts in elementary school. Second, even if we could use IP
to rein in all this low-cost production and distribution of stuff, we may
not want to. The point of IP has always been, not to raise prices and
reduce consumption for its own sake, but to encourage people to create
things when they otherwise wouldn’t. More and more evidence casts doubt on
the link between IP and creation, however. Empirical evidence suggests that
offering money may actually stifle rather than drive creativity among
individuals. Economic evidence suggests that quite often it is competition,
not the lure of monopoly, that drives corporate innovation. The Internet
may have spawned unprecedented piracy, but it has also given rise to the
creation of more works of all types than ever before in history, often by
multiple orders of magnitude.

Far from necessitating more IP protection, then, the development of
cost-reducing technologies may actually weaken the case for IP. If people
are intrinsically motivated to create, as they seem to be, the easier it is
to create and distribute content, the more content is likely to be
available even in the absence of IP. And if the point of IP is to encourage
either the creation or the distribution of that content, cost-reducing
technologies may actually mean we have less, not more, need for IP.

IP rights are a form of government regulation of market entry and market
prices. We regulated all sorts of industries in the 20th century, from
airlines to trucking to telephones to electric power, often because we
couldn’t conceive of how the industry could survive without the government
preventing entry by competitors. Towards the end of that century, however,
we experimented with deregulation, and it turned out that the market could
provide many of those services better in the absence of government
regulation. The same thing may turn out to be true of IP regulation in the
21st century. We didn’t get rid of all regulation by any means, and we
won’t get rid of all IP. But we came to understand that the free market,
not government control over entry, is the right default position in the
absence of a persuasive justification for limiting that market. The
elimination of scarcity will put substantial pressure on the law to do the
same with IP.

A world without scarcity requires a major rethinking of economics, much as
the decline of the agrarian economy did in the 19th century. How will our
economy function in a world in which most of the things we produce are
cheap or free? We have lived with scarcity for so long that it is hard even
to begin to think about the transition to a post-scarcity economy. IP has
allowed us to cling to scarcity as an organizing principle in a world that
no longer demands it. But it will no more prevent the transition than
agricultural price supports kept us all farmers. We need a post-scarcity
economics, one that accepts rather than resists the new opportunities
technology will offer us. Developing that economics is the great task of
the 21st century.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:14.300871,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:37:50.622000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/citation/,3vy5a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vpfbh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/relationships/node/,vpfbh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc89f09ad5a101f568d3a5/,57bc89f09ad5a101f568d3a5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3vy5a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3vy5a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3vy5a

relationship to the architecture of the Internet. It is our view that the
extraordinary growth and innovation of the Internet depends crucially upon
this architecture. Changes in this architecture should be viewed with
skepticism, as they may in turn threaten this innovation and growth. Many
cable companies have recently adopted or threatened a policy of bundling
high-speed cable modem service with ISP service. This bundling threatens to
compromise an important architectural principle of the Internet: the
Internet's ""End-to-End"" design. In our view, this change could have
profound implications for the future of growth and innovation on the net.
The FCC's analysis of the cable modem industry to date has not considered
these principles of the Internet's design. It therefore does not adequately
evaluate the potential threat that bundling presents to open access to the
Internet. Neither does the FCC's approach properly account for its role in
creating the conditions that made the Internet possible. Under the banner
of ""no regulation,"" the FCC threatens to permit this network to calcify as
earlier telecommunications networks did. Further, and ironically, the FCC's
supposed ""hands off"" approach will ultimately lead to more rather than less
regulation. We do not yet know enough about the relationship between these
architectural principles and the innovation of the Internet. But we should
know enough to be skeptical of changes in its design. The strong
presumption should be in favor of preserving the architectural features
that have produced this extraordinary innovation. The FCC's presumption
should be against approving mergers or policies that threaten these design
principles, without a clear showing that the threat would not undermine the
Internet's innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:09.022451,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:33:14.598000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/citation/,fyq5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ecttx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/relationships/node/,ecttx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc88dbb83f6901f6655e28/,57bc88dbb83f6901f6655e28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fyq5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fyq5v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fyq5v

increasingly playing a role in legal argument. Judges, litigators and

telecommunications law, Internet law, corporate law, contract law and even
the law of racial discrimination need to be modified to take account of
network effects. Their arguments reflect a wide range of views about what
network effects are and how courts should react to them. In this Article,
we explore the application of network economic theory in each of these
contexts. We suggest ways in which particular legal rules should -- and

an ex ante incentive to innovate. An increasingly common justification for
longer and more powerful IP rights is ex post - that IP will be ""managed""
most efficiently if control is consolidated in a single owner. This
argument is made, for example, in the prospect and rent dissipation
literature in patent law, in justifications for expansive rights of
publicity, and in defense of the Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Taken
to an extreme, this argument justifies perpetual protection with no real
exceptions. Those who rely on this theory take the idea of IP as ""property""
too seriously, and reason that since individual pieces of property are
perpetually managed, IP should be too. But IP isn't just like real
property; indeed, it gives IP owners control over what others do with their
real property. The ex post justification is strikingly anti-market. We
would never say today that the market for paper clips would be ""efficiently
managed"" if put into the hands of a single firm. We rely on competition to
do that for us. But that is exactly what the ex post theory would do.

In this paper, I explore the sub rosa development of this ex post theory of
IP. I argue that the basis for continued control is the assumption that the
value of IP rights will be dissipated if they are used too much. This
argument is fundamentally at odds with the public goods nature of
information. It stems from a particular sort of myopia about private
ordering, in which actions by individual private firms are presumed to be
ideal and the traditional role of the market in disciplining errant firms

problems that stump the experts, and that the lone genius will do so only
if properly incented. We deny patents on inventions that are ""obvious"" to
ordinarily innovative scientists in the field. Our goal is to encourage
extraordinary inventions – those that we wouldn’t expect to get without the
incentive of a patent.

The canonical story of the lone genius inventor is largely a myth. Edison
didn’t invent the light bulb; he found a bamboo fiber that worked better as
a filament in the light bulb developed by Sawyer and Man, who in turn built
on lighting work done by others. Bell filed for his telephone patent on the
very same day as an independent inventor, Elisha Gray; the case ultimately
went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which filled an entire volume of U.S.
Reports resolving the question of whether Bell could have a patent despite
the fact that he hadn’t actually gotten the invention to work at the time
he filed. The Wright Brothers were the first to fly at Kitty Hawk, but
their plane didn’t work very well, and was quickly surpassed by aircraft
built by Glenn Curtis and others – planes that the Wrights delayed by over
a decade with patent lawsuits.

The point can be made more general: surveys of hundreds of significant new
technologies show that almost all of them are invented simultaneously or
nearly simultaneously by two or more teams working independently of each
other. Invention appears in significant part to be a social, not an
individual, phenomenon. Inventors build on the work of those who came
before, and new ideas are often ""in the air,"" or result from changes in
market demand or the availability of new or cheaper starting materials. And
in the few circumstances where that is not true – where inventions truly
are ""singletons"" – it is often because of an accident or error in the
experiment rather than a conscious effort to invent.

The result is a real problem for classic theories of patent law. If we are
supposed to be encouraging only inventions that others in the field
couldn’t have made, we should be paying a lot more attention than we
currently do to simultaneous invention. We should issuing very few patents
– surely not the 200,000 per year we do today. And we should be denying
patents on the vast majority of the most important inventions, since most
seem to involve near-simultaneous invention. Put simply, our dominant
theory of patent law doesn’t seem to explain the way we actually implement
that law.

Maybe the problem is not with our current patent law, but with our current
patent theory. But the dominant alternative theories of patent law don’t do
much better. Prospect theory – under which we give patents early to one
company so it can control research and development – makes little sense in
a world in which ideas are in the air, likely to be happened upon by
numerous inventors at about the same time. And commercialization theory,
which hypothesizes that we grant patents in order to encourage not
invention but product development, seems to founder on a related historical
fact: most first inventors turn out to be lousy commercializers who end up
delaying implementation of the invention by exercising their rights.

If patent law in its current form can be saved, we need an alternative
justification for granting patents even in circumstances of
near-simultaneous invention. I consider two other possibilities. First,
patent rights encourage patent races, and that might actually be a good
thing. Second, patents might facilitate markets for technology. Both have
some logic to them, but neither fully justifies patent law in its current
form. As a result, I offer some suggestions for reforming patent law to
take account of the prevalence of simultaneous invention.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:44.590750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:14:55.534000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/citation/,ncyh7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s3zjh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/relationships/node/,s3zjh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc8490594d9001fdd0d977/,57bc8490594d9001fdd0d977,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ncyh7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncyh7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ncyh7

rights has long been neglected in debates over the economics of
intellectual property. In a path-breaking work, Rob Merges studied what he
calls ""collective rights organizations,"" industry groups that collect
intellectual property rights from owners and license them as a package.
Merges finds that these organizations ease some of the tensions created by
strong intellectual property rights by allowing industries to bargain from
a property rule into a liability rule. Collective rights organizations thus
play a valuable role in facilitating transactions in intellectual property
rights.

There is another sort of organization that mediates between intellectual
property owners and users, however. Standard-setting organizations (SSOs)
regularly encounter situations in which one or more companies claim to own
proprietary rights that cover a proposed industry standard. The industry
cannot adopt the standard without the permission of the intellectual
property owner (or owners).

How SSOs respond to those who assert intellectual property rights is
critically important. Whether or not private companies retain intellectual
property rights in group standards will determine whether a standard is
""open"" or ""closed."" It will determine who can sell compliant products, and
it may well influence whether the standard adopted in the market is one
chosen by a group or one offered by a single company. SSO rules governing
intellectual property rights will also affect how standards change as
technology improves.

Given the importance of SSO rules governing intellectual property rights,
there has been surprisingly little treatment of SSO intellectual property
rules in the legal literature. My aim in this article is to fill that void.
To do so, I have studied the intellectual property policies of dozens of
SSOs, primarily but not exclusively in the computer networking and
telecommunications industries. This is no accident; interface standards are
much more prevalent in those industries than in other fields. In Part I, I
provide some background on SSOs themselves, and discuss the value of group
standard setting in network markets. In Part II, I discuss my empirical
research, which demonstrates a remarkable diversity among SSOs even within
a given industry in how they treat intellectual property. In Part III, I
analyze a host of unresolved contract and intellectual property law issues
relating to the applicability and enforcement of such intellectual property
policies. In Part IV, I consider the constraints the antitrust laws place
on SSOs in general, and on their adoption of intellectual property policies
in particular. Part V offers a theory of SSO intellectual property rules as
a sort of messy private ordering, allowing companies to bargain in the
shadow of patent law in those industries in which it is most important that
they do so. Finally, in Part VI I offer ideas for how the law can improve
the efficiency of this private ordering process.

In the end, I hope to convince the reader of four things. First, SSO rules
governing intellectual property fundamentally change the way in which we
must approach the study of intellectual property. It is not enough to
consider IP rights in a vacuum; we must consider them as they are actually
used in practice. And that means considering how SSO rules affect IP
incentives in different industries. Second, there is a remarkable diversity
among SSOs in how they treat IP rights. This diversity is largely
accidental, and does not reflect conscious competition between different
policies. Third, the law is not well designed to take account of the modern
role of SSOs. Antitrust rules may unduly restrict SSOs even when those
organizations are serving procompetitive ends. And enforcement of SSO IP
rules presents a number of important but unresolved problems of contract
and intellectual property law, issues that will need to be resolved if SSO
IP rules are to fulfill their promise of solving patent holdup problems.

My fourth conclusion is an optimistic one. SSOs are a species of private
ordering that may help solve one of the fundamental dilemmas of
intellectual property law: the fact that intellectual property rights seem
to promote innovation in some industries but harm innovation in others.
SSOs may serve to ameliorate the problems of overlapping intellectual
property rights in those industries in which IP is most problematic for
innovation, particularly in the semiconductor, software, and
telecommunications fields. The best thing the government can do is to
enforce these private ordering agreements and avoid unduly restricting SSOs
by overzealous antitrust scrutiny.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:27.580957,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:12:53.909000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/citation/,cbf9r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uszf5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/relationships/node/,uszf5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc84179ad5a101f868d3fd/,57bc84179ad5a101f868d3fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbf9r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cbf9r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cbf9r

more harm in the software industry than in other industries such as
pharmaceuticals. They have pointed to a variety of problems and offered a
variety of solutions.

While there is some truth to each of these criticisms, the real problem
with software patents lies elsewhere. Software patent lawyers are
increasingly writing patent claims in broad functional terms. Put another
way, patentees claim to own not a particular machine, or even a particular
series of steps for achieving a goal, but the goal itself. The resulting
overbroad patents overlap and create patent thickets.

Patent law has faced this problem before. The Supreme Court ultimately
rejected such broad functional claiming in the 1940s as inconsistent with
the purposes of the patent statute. When Congress rewrote the Patent Act in
1952, it adopted a compromise position: patentees could write their claim
language in functional terms, but when they did so the patent would not
cover the goal itself, but only the particular means of implementing that
goal described by the patentee and equivalents thereof. These
“means-plus-function” claims permitted the patentee to use functional
language to describe an element of their invention, but did not permit her
to own the function itself however implemented.

Most software patents today are written in functional terms. If courts
would faithfully apply the 1952 Act, limiting those claims to the actual
algorithms the patentees disclosed and their equivalents, they could
prevent overclaiming by software patentees and solve much of the patent
thicket problem that besets software innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:07.992758,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T17:10:19.373000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/citation/,kb8d5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/429mk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/relationships/node/,429mk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc837d9ad5a101f668d64f/,57bc837d9ad5a101f668d64f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb8d5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kb8d5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kb8d5
