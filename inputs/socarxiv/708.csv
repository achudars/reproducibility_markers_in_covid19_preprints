As a social problem, little is known about how individuals are portrayed in the news when race/ethnicity and mental illness intersect. This is important because of the ability of news to influence perceptions and policies about mental illness across race/ethnicity. This article examines how individuals with mental illness who were killed by police during 2015 and 2016 were portrayed in the news.

By depending on standard human-generated code, many statistical software programs commonly used in economics and the social sciences inadvertently rely on the human willpower of scientists, and inspite of an assumed invincibility, such individuals are nearly necessarily prone to errors and research integrity compromises, as is increasingly clear. Removing the vast majority of arbitrary and subjective data judgments, including the generation of code, from researcher control would free behavioural and social scientists from human limitations.  Automating the text annotations that accompany data visualizations in figures and diagrams using emerging natural language processing tools can also free scientists from overconfidence or the temptation to embellish findings.

With an emphasis on the implementation of the Schengen acquis—the EU’s common policies on cooperation in law enforcement, visas, and the management of its borders--this article begins with an examination of the ways in which third country nationals are categorized as a group separate from EU citizens.  This article then explores how the everyday presence of the border between Słubice and Frankfurt(Oder) excluded third country nationals from the exercise of EU citizenship through practices that placed limits on their freedom of movement.  Finally, this article describes how specific individuals responded to these limitations by strategically managing their visa and citizenship statuses.

Because of the cities’ unique border location, the residents of Słubice/Frankfurt(Oder) demonstrate the development of unequal citizenship regimes for EU citizens and non-citizens, in which each group is extended differential access to the entitlements, privileges, and rights of citizenship.  By exploring how third country nationals’ ability to exercise citizenship rights were structured and constrained by EU laws and regulations, this article documents the emergence of one instance of illiberality within the EU’s ostensibly neoliberal and democratic economic and political projects, and brings into sharp relief the central role the right to free movement plays in the exercise of full citizenship within the EU.",TRUE,FALSE,Citizenship|Citizenship Regimes|EU Citizenship|Germany|Poland|Schengen Acquis,2018-07-02T10:58:08.753075,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-17T18:55:46.874153,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/citation/,mbjhk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uenfk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/relationships/node/,uenfk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591c9c00594d90024f89980c/,591c9c00594d90024f89980c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbjhk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbjhk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mbjhk

Our matching approach takes into account pre-event confounders that are both time-independent and time-dependent, as well as life course trajectories. After matching, treated and control individuals can be compared using standard statistical tests or regression models. We apply our approach to the study of the consequences of the age at retirement on subsequent health outcomes, using a unique dataset from Swedish administrative registers. Once selectivity in the timing of retirement is taken into account, effects on hospitalization are small, while early retirement has negative effects on survival. Our approach also allows for heterogeneous treatment effects. We show that the effects of early retirement differ according to pre-retirement income, with higher income individuals tending to benefit from early retirement, while the opposite is true for individuals with lower income.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:58:08.692538,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-17T09:27:10.867296,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/citation/,rqwpf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/68znv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/relationships/node/,68znv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591c1622594d90024fc3848b/,591c1622594d90024fc3848b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqwpf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rqwpf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rqwpf

Widening of a gap between early beginning of sexual activities and late reproduction start of individuals is a phenomenon specific to humans, not observed in apes, other mammals or other species. We believe that this gap significantly impacts the TFR, while not only economic but also social and cultural aspects like ethics, morals, and religions are important to reverse the low TFR.

Shamanism also existed among nearly all documented hunter-gatherers, likely characterized the religious lives of many ancestral humans, and is often proposed by anthropologists to be the “first profession”, representing the first institutionalized division of labor beyond age and sex. This paper proposes a cultural evolutionary theory to explain why shamanism consistently develops, and in particular, (1) why shamanic traditions exhibit recurrent features around the world, (2) why shamanism professionalizes early, often in the absence of other specialization, and (3) how shifting social conditions affect the form or existence of shamanism. According to this theory, shamanism is a set of traditions developed through cultural evolution that adapts to people’s intuitions to convince observers that a practitioner can influence otherwise unpredictable, significant events. The shaman does this by ostensibly transforming during initiation and trance, violating folk-intuitions of humanness to assure group-members that he or she can interact with the invisible forces that control uncertain outcomes. Entry requirements for becoming a shaman persist because the practitioner’s credibility depends on them “transforming”. This contrasts with dealing with problems that have identifiable solutions (like building a canoe), where credibility hinges on showing results and outsiders can invade the jurisdiction by producing the outcome. Shamanism is an ancient human institution that recurs because of the capacity of cultural evolution to produce practices adapted to innate psychological tendencies.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|evolution|religion|shamanism|trance,2018-07-02T10:58:08.253699,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-16T00:27:19.492306,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/citation/,bemhx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dsmqg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/relationships/node/,dsmqg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591a461d594d90024dc2fc49/,591a461d594d90024dc2fc49,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bemhx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bemhx

A smaller literature has begun to examine the intergenerational impacts of in utero conditions.  A link between these two literatures—the impacts of in utero conditions on family formation—has had few examinations but offers a potential set of mechanisms for the intergenerational reach of early conditions.  This paper draws from the 1960 US Decennial Census to examine whether exposed individuals had different family formation patterns than adjacent unexposed cohorts.  The findings suggest small overall effects on marriage rates, number of children, and several measures of “type” of spouse for men, but moderate effects for women. The findings also show that exposed individuals have spouses with lower schooling than unexposed counterparts, this effect is particularly large for women, and it increases the likelihood of marrying spouses with very low levels of schooling.",TRUE,FALSE,1918 Influenza Pandemic|Family Formation|In Utero Exposure|Life Course Analysis,2018-07-02T10:58:08.109648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-15T18:35:36.391655,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/citation/,bp7sv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c6xdp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/relationships/node/,c6xdp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5919f4939ad5a10251a72a6e/,5919f4939ad5a10251a72a6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bp7sv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bp7sv

Reacting to critiques that the smart city is overly technocratic and instrumental, companies and cities have reframed their initiatives as ‘citizen-centric’. However, what ‘citizen-centric’ means in practice is rarely articulated. We draw on and extend Sherry Arnstein’s seminal work on participation in planning and renewal programmes to create the ‘Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation’ – a conceptual tool to unpack the diverse ways in which the smart city frames citizens. We then use this scaffold to measure smart citizen inclusion, participation, and empowerment in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland. Our analysis illustrates how most ‘citizen-centric’ smart city initiatives are rooted in stewardship, civic paternalism, and a neoliberal conception of citizenship that prioritizes consumption choice and individual autonomy within a framework of state and corporate defined constraints that prioritize market-led solutions to urban issues, rather than being grounded in civil, social and political rights and the common good. We conclude that significant normative work is required to rethink ‘smart citizens’ and ‘smart citizenship’ and to remake smart cities if they are to truly become ‘citizen-centric’.",TRUE,FALSE,citizens|citizenship|engagement|participation|rights|smart city,2018-07-02T10:58:07.682566,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-15T10:13:47.522686,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/citation/,v24jn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rjbnw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/relationships/node/,rjbnw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59197e9b9ad5a10250a6e15f/,59197e9b9ad5a10250a6e15f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v24jn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v24jn

However, there were stark differences in the trend for the non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white populations. In this paper we assess differences in opioid deaths by race. We analyze patterns and trends in multiple cause-of-death data to gain a better understanding of how deaths differ by race and what has contributed to changes over time. The trend in race-specific opioid death rates over 2000–2015 can be divided into two periods: 2000–2010 and 2010–2015. The increase in 2000–2010 was more substantial for the white population and was driven by prescription painkillers. Since 2010, the rates of opioid-mortality increase for both the white and black populations have been similar and largely due to heroin and fentanyl-type opioids. For the white population, death rates due to heroin and fentanyl-type drugs decrease with age, but for the black population, the opposite is true. In addition, the number of deaths that involve more than one opioid drug has increased over time, with the rate of increase coinciding with the overall rate of increase in opioid deaths.",TRUE,FALSE,health disparities|opioid|public health,2018-07-02T10:58:07.648628,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-15T03:50:17.464699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/citation/,jm38s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/75kr2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/relationships/node/,75kr2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59192460594d90024dc2b172/,59192460594d90024dc2b172,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jm38s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jm38s/,https://doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0000000000000858,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jm38s

Drawing on literature from feminist and queer critical GIS with special attention to the under-examined political economy of GIS, I suggest that the critical project of queering all of GIS, both GIScience and GISystems, requires not just recognition of the labor and lives of queers and research in geographies of sexualities. Based upon a queer feminist political economic critique and evidenced in my teaching critical GIS at two elite liberal arts colleges, I argue that “status quo” between ESRI and geography as a field must be interrupted. Extending a critical GIS focus beyond data structures and data ethics, I argue that geographic researchers and instructors have a responsibility in queering our choice and production of software, algorithms, and code alike. I call this production and choice of democratic, accessible, and useful software by, for, and about the needs of its users good enough software. Instead, I argue that “status quo” between ESRI and geography as a field must be interrupted.",TRUE,FALSE,critical geography|critical GIS|free and open-sourced software (FOSS)|pedagogy|QGIS|queer,2018-07-02T10:58:07.035140,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-13T14:52:11.265648,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c9a|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c9f|Arts and Humanities|American Studies|Other American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/citation/,da7h4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hvu53/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/relationships/node/,hvu53,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59171d156c613b024c278949/,59171d156c613b024c278949,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/da7h4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/da7h4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/da7h4
