However, this could only be possible, if the youth population is trained with the required skill-set for the job market with improved opportunities for higher education. Unfortunately, the percentage of higher education enrolment does not possess encouraging numbers due to various social &amp; economic reasons. The ratio in the coming years can be improved by offering the higher education courses in open &amp; distance learning mode (ODL). Recently University Grants Commission (UGC also eased the norms for the higher educational institutes to offer ODL programs. However, the present ODL programs that are being offered were challenged with (i) lack of quality checks (ii) lack of paradigm shift in the course delivery, which is still through correspondence mode (iii) the degrees offered by the distance mode are not on par with regular courses. In this view, it is time to assess the quality of the present ODL programs and the necessary steps have to be initiated to improve the quality of the program. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic condition, major parts of the world dependent on online classes for the delivery of the regular courses, in this view, various tools for delivery and assessment are being widely used/developed.

collection agencies (BCAs). Many countries, such as Canada and Australia, that rely on non-remunerated
voluntary donors, saw an initial drop in donors in the early days of the pandemic followed by a return to
sufficient levels of the blood supply. BCA messaging plays a key role in communicating the needs of the
blood operator, promoting and encouraging donation, educating, and connecting with the public and
donors. This paper reports on discourse analysis (Bloor and Bloor, 2013) of BCA messaging in Canada
and Australia from March 1-July 31, 2020 to understand how BCAs constructed donation to encourage
donation during this period and what this can tell us about public trust and blood operators. Drawing on
multiple sources of online content and print media, our analysis identified four dominant messages
during the study period: 1) blood donation is safe; 2) blood donation is designated an essential activity;
3) blood is needed; and 4) blood donation is a response to the pandemic. In Canada and Australia, our
analysis suggests that: 1) implicit within constructions of blood donation as safe is the message that
BCAs can be trusted; 2) messages that construct blood donation as essential and needed implicitly ask
donors to trust BCAs in order to share in the commitment of meeting patient needs; and 3) the
pandemic has made possible the construction of blood donation as both an exceptional and
commonplace activity. For BCAs, our analysis supports donor communications that are transparent and
responsive to public concerns, and the local context, to support public trust. Beyond BCAs, health
organizations and leaders cannot underestimate the importance of building and maintaining public trust
as countries continue to struggle with containment of the virus and encourage vaccine uptake.",TRUE,FALSE,blood donation; blood banks; trust; COVID-19; messaging; discourse analysis,2021-06-17T01:38:22.004302,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-17T01:37:58.123656,FALSE,NA,no,Data is available if the authors are contacted and a data sharing agreement signed.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/citation/,f2c8v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ca8f3a18f70b0521a764cd/,60ca8f3a18f70b0521a764cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f2c8v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f2c8v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f2c8v

A distributional analysis for the USA and Germany.,"Licensing is a central institution in labor markets worldwide. Using the example of the USA and Germany, this study shows strong institutional differences between licensing systems that are of great importance for wage distribution but are not yet part of the debate about the economic consequences of licensing. The two countries differ significantly in terms of the rules of entry into occupational labor markets, the competencies of occupational boards, and the combination of licensing with price regulation. I claim that licensing systems change the bargaining power and bargaining scope for wages, which leads to different wage premiums across the distribution and different consequences for wage inequality. Using novel license data, I empirically show that licensing is associated with the largest relative wage premium for German low-wage and American middle-wage workers. In addition, the USA system leads to greater dispersion among licensed workers and to higher wage inequality overall.

Policies of uncertainty are said to directly and indirectly create harm by impacting on individual’s health via detention and public degradation and undermining healthcare services. We offer original empirical evidence indicating an association with uncertainty, in the form of asylum waiting times, on refugees’ self-reported health.  We devise four hypotheses that: long waiting time for asylum decisions increases likelihood of self-reported health problems and the effect persists overtime, that female refugees report higher levels of health problems and religion moderates the association between health and uncertainty.  We use data from the UK longitudinal Survey of New Refugees wherein all new refugees were sent a baseline survey immediately after receiving refugee status and then follow-up surveys 21 months later. The findings show longer asylum waiting time is associated with poor health. Female refugees were more likely to report poor emotional and physical health. The negative effect of asylum waiting time on emotional health persists 21 months post settlement and is worse for women. The hypothesis about the ameliorating effect of religion is only partially supported. Our findings supports existing theory and qualitative studies on the deleterious effects of using policies of waiting-related uncertainty for managing migration.  Given the wide use of such policies in the Global North, our work is suggestive of likely generalisability. Thus, countries with large refugee populations might want to consider our findings when developing asylum policy which minimises impact on refugee health.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum policy|asylum seekers|asylum waiting time|emotional health|gender|physical health|refugee integration|refugees|religion|violent uncertainty,2021-06-17T01:38:43.181523,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-17T01:38:23.278973,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6556,no,"Secondary data analysis was conducted using the Survey of New Refugees, publicly available on the UK Data Service: https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6556",,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/citation/,mzsnf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ca153918f70b04eba75c9f/,60ca153918f70b04eba75c9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mzsnf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mzsnf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mzsnf

A common trend is increased income inequality at the top of the distribution. The sources of this trend are a matter of debate. Increased demand for analytical and managerial skills is said to have strongly increased labor incomes at the top. Other scholars have indicated that structural conditions, such as financialization or favorable taxation, have benefited top-earning households. Here, we contribute to the latter line of reasoning. We show that payroll taxation reinforces income inequality at the top. Such taxation has large fiscal volume and redistributive power. However, our knowledge about the distributional consequences of payroll taxation as a tax scheme is remarkably thin. We claim that payroll taxes are central to understanding income inequality. Many countries, such as Germany and the US, restrict payroll taxes to a maximum amount, resulting in significant payroll tax-exempted incomes for high-earning households. Strongly growing top-labor incomes thus lead to increased payroll tax-exempted incomes for households at the upper parts of the distribution and, consequently, to higher income dispersion. We use Germany (1992–2017), a highly redistributive country, as a case study. Our empirical results suggest that: a) households increasingly profit from payroll-exempted labor incomes across the upper quarter; b) this benefit has increased over time; and c) increased amounts of payroll tax-exempted labor income explain up to 60% of income dispersion at the top of the distribution.

Instead of active investors influencing states through their investment decisions, in this new economic reality the locus of agency is shifting from investors towards index providers as they decide which companies and countries are included into key benchmark indexes. We argue that the major index providers (MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell) exercise growing private authority as they steer capital via their indexes. Index providers have become crucial intermediaries in the relationship between states and investors. Through producing widely used indexes, index providers essentially provide a crucial infrastructure that enables the creation and trading of increasingly passively allocated financial claims. Through the infrastructural power they derive from this gatekeeper position, index providers are able to ‘standardise’ the issuers of capital claims and the countries in which these issuers reside through determining the criteria that corporations and states, especially emerging markets, have to fulfil to qualify for index membership – and consequently asset allocation. This chapter therefore investigates the relationship between states and index providers and the latter’s influence on issues of domestic financial regulation, investor access and international capital flows.",TRUE,FALSE,emerging markets|ETFs|global finance|index providers|investor access|passive investing|power,2021-06-16T19:11:20.769234,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-16T19:11:14.093089,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/citation/,x45j3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c9d47eda0ff2049c38fd48/,60c9d47eda0ff2049c38fd48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x45j3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x45j3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x45j3

Most critically, values and beliefs do not manifest in behaviour to the same degree when people are on vacation. In this study we introduce habit as a potential driver of environmentally sustainable behaviour on vacation. We propose that tourists have a higher likelihood of displaying pro-environmental behaviours on vacation when such behaviours are a habit; an automatic behaviour occurring without awareness. We develop a conceptual model with habit at the core and provide initial empirical proof of concept.",TRUE,FALSE,effort|environmental sustainability|habit|hedonism|tourism,2021-06-16T01:21:25.486079,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-16T01:21:07.911165,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/citation/,ecdx3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c939c4da0ff2045f391f7d/,60c939c4da0ff2045f391f7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ecdx3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ecdx3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ecdx3

FDS is frequently employed as a strategy by L1 speakers to adapt their speech when talking to learners of a specific language; it is generally described as a rapport-building behavior that helps L2 speakers understand the conversation better. In a recent questionnaire study, 85% of L1 speakers reported adjusting their English when speaking to L2 speakers (Margić, 2017). Critically, L2 speakers’ reports on its consequences or effectiveness were not included. Through Qualtrics Panels, we surveyed 192 L1 speakers of English (Mage= 53 years old; 97 female/94 male/1 no response) and 201 L2 speakers of English (Mage= 37 years old; 100 female/98 male/3 non-binary) using a newly developed questionnaire to determine how speech accommodation is perceived. Contrary to previous findings, over half of our L1 participants reported that they do not change their speech when talking to L2 speakers (61%). Half reported they do not like doing it (52%), and 30% are frustrated when it is expected of them. Consistent with our L1 findings, only a third of L2 participants reported L1 speakers change their speech when talking to them (36%), 47% do not like it, and 64% are frustrated when L1 speakers do not accommodate them. Additionally, 57% report they avoid talking to L1 speakers out of fear of being judged, and 40% say that they have been talked down to by L1 speakers. Individual differences appear to modulate how L1 and L2 speakers use FDS and perceive it: For both groups, we found a relationship between the FDS questionnaire and measures of anxiety, personality, L2 proficiency, as well as the frequency of interactions between L1 and L2 speakers. Results are interpreted in light of Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles &amp; Ogay, 2007).",TRUE,FALSE,accommodation|communication accommodation theory|foreigner-directed speech|Qualtrics,2021-06-16T01:18:27.839154,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-16T01:17:55.565884,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|First and Second Language Acquisition,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/citation/,jwefk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60c8fc9a18f70b0440a76e6b/,60c8fc9a18f70b0440a76e6b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jwefk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jwefk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jwefk
