How Conservative Values Affect Helping Behavior towards Friends,"Individualism operates as a dominant ideology in American society, so how does individualism pervade both people’s larger views on society as well as their dyadic relationships? Do world views about the value of hard work and if people deserve help permeate the private sphere in tangible ways? I propose a relationship between individualistic tendencies and the frequency with which individuals help their friends and family who are feeling depressed. I hypothesize that the more the respondent believes that those in need have to learn to take care of themselves, the less frequently they will help a relative, friend, or neighbor who is a bit down or depressed by talking to them. I also hypothesize that the more the respondent believes that people get ahead by their own hard work, the less frequently they will engage in this helping behavior. Finally, I hypothesize that the more conservative the respondent is, the less frequently they will engage in this helping behavior. I test the relationship between these typically conservative values and helping behavior using a sample of 828 respondents from the 2014 General Social Survey (GSS) dataset, controlling for gender, race, age, and education. Results from bivariate and OLS regression analyses report that there is no statistically significant relationship between conservative values and helping behavior, so the hypotheses are not supported. Instead, two control variables impact the dependent variable. Gender has the strongest effect on the frequency with which one helps a relative, friend, or neighbor who is feeling depressed, followed by race.

Drawing on two contrasting theories: the theory of group interests and class-based theories of 
stratification put forth by Wilson and Shelton (2006), I propose that African -Americans who 
report being of a high socio-economic class are more likely to be Republican than African 
Americans of a lower socio-economic class. Through secondary analysis of data provided by the 
General Social Survey (GSS), I investigate the relationship between political party affiliation and 
social class in the African-American community. By combining data across 20 years between 
1996 and 2016, the sample size is 1557 African-Americans. Measures of socio-economic status 
are limited to a single variable that asks respondents about their subjective social class, while the 
dependent variable was operationalized by a variable that inquires the respondent's political party 
affiliation. Multiple regression analysis reveals that there is no statistically significant 
relationship between social class and political party affiliation. There is however, a relationship 
between political party affiliation and another measure of social class, specifically the 
respondents' level of education. The strongest predictor of political party affiliation is the age of 
the respondents which gives insight on future voting patterns in the African-American 
community. While the hypothesis is not supported, the results shed light on the potential reasons 
for increased support for the Republican Party among African-Americans and could be used to 
predict voting outcomes among African-Americans for future elections.",TRUE,FALSE,Class|Political Party Affiliations|Race,2018-12-25T14:51:41.719096,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-25T14:51:16.546880,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/citation/,q659n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1eaab77cd9be001b5c3ef5/,5c1eaab77cd9be001b5c3ef5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q659n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q659n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q659n,NA

The Effect of Cultural and Social Capital on Mental Health,"Does social and cultural capital have beneficial outcomes that extend to the mental well-being of First Generation College graduates? Obtaining higher levels of educational degrees is known to produce positive rewards in lifestyle, opportunities, and income. Educational mobility is directly linked to social mobility. As one climbs the social ladder, one builds a broader network of people to rely on. This study analyzes 2010-2014 General Social Survey (GSS) data to report on the relationship between first-generation graduate status and self-reported days of mental health among 1654 non-institutionalized respondents in the U.S. All the parents of the respondents in the subset did not have a college degree of any kind. I hypothesize that among individuals whose parents do not have a college degree, first-generation college graduates (FGCG) are more likely to report less days of poor mental health than respondents with no college degree. The results support the hypothesis. Being a FGCG decreases the amount of days of poor mental well-being. In this study I make the connection that acquiring social and cultural capital is an effect of FGCG status. However, age appears to have a significant effect on the number of days of poor mental health, as well.

In so doing, the resulting impact of a strategic policy mix can be greater than the sum of the individual policies of its individual parts. That synergetic potential can be utilized to attain strategic objectives. This is the case when it comes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. However, identifying and quantifying these synergetic interactions is infeasible with traditional approaches to policy analysis. In this paper we present a method for identifying these interactions and assessing them quantitatively. We also introduce a typology of five classes of synergy that enables an understanding of their structures. We operationalize the typology by the use of pilot studies of SDG strategies undertaken in Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Malawi. In the pilots, the Integrated Sustainable Development Goal (iSDG) model was used to simulate the effects of policies over the SDG time horizon. In each case, synergetic interactions contribute to potential SDG attainment. We estimate the value of these interactions to be 2.8% of GDP for Côte d’Ivoire, 4.4% for Malawi, and 0.7% for Senegal. We conclude that enhanced understanding of synergies in sustainable development planning can contribute to progress on the SDGs – and set free substantial amounts of resources.",TRUE,FALSE,integrated policy|policy coherence|sdg|SDGs|Sustainable Development Goals|synergies|synergy,2018-12-25T14:53:03.075833,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-25T14:52:36.054667,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/citation/,jt6r7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4fh2k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/relationships/node/,4fh2k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1ea3d9bba2cd001b8a3436/,5c1ea3d9bba2cd001b8a3436,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt6r7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jt6r7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jt6r7,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817276116

This study explores female faculty members’ feelings of isolation within their department across academic disciplines. Drawing on the theory of tokenism, I hypothesize that women faculty members in STEM disciplines, which have been historically male-dominated, are more likely to express a lesser sense of belonging in their department, than women faculty members in the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities. I analyzed data from a 2009 online survey administered to tenure-track and tenured faculty at two highly selective liberal arts colleges. After restricting my analysis to women, I controlled for women’s familial responsibilities as well as their position within the academic institution. Unlike previous research at universities, OLS regression analysis showed that women in STEM actually expressed a higher level of fitting in their department than those in other disciplines.

Additional knowledge-besides attending Arts-related events-is required in order to understand what makes people happy. I analyzed 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) data. The N for this sample is 1,272. Personal happiness is directly tied to one’s financial situation and their educational attainment levels and not to attendance at music performances.

I propose that the differences in men and women’s emotional processing as a result of gendered socialization have an effect on their attitudes towards improving the lives of Blacks. I performed a secondary analysis on 2016 survey responses from a subset of 533 White, American, English or Spanish-speaking, non-institutionalized adults who responded to the General Social Survey. Respondents were asked about their attitudes towards spending to improve the conditions of Blacks. I found no statistically significant relationship between self-identified sex and a respondent’s attitude towards spending to improve the conditions of Blacks. These findings do not support my hypothesis and are inconsistent with prior research done on this topic. I did, however, find a statistically significant relationship between respondents’ political views and their attitude towards spending to improve the conditions of Blacks.

Previous research has shown that whether one lives in an urban, suburban, or rural setting affects one’s environmental spending views and behaviors. I propose that living in an urban setting causes one to believe that the United States government is spending too little on the protection and improvement of the environment. Using 1,240 responses from interviews conducted in the 2016 General Social Survey, regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between community size and environmental spending views while controlling for political view, family income, and years of education completed. The results from the bivariate analysis show no correlation between community size and environmental spending views, but a weak, positive correlation between political views and environmental spending views, suggesting that identifying as liberal is what drives environmental spending views. Additionally, bivariate results show a very weak, positive correlation between highest year of school completed and environmental spending views. In the multivariate results, this relationship disappeared, but political view remained a statistically significant variable on environmental spending views. These results do not support my hypothesis, though they challenge much of the literature on the subject. Future research should further explore sociological determinants of environmental spending views such as political view, and examine the waning of the community size effect.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-21T22:56:08.230323,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T22:55:39.017174,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/citation/,5rkum,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1d276979426a00164860e8/,5c1d276979426a00164860e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5rkum/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5rkum/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5rkum,NA
