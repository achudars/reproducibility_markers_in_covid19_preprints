An inferentialist account of computer simulation,"The dual problems of how an idealized model can represent and provide information about its target have become a central topic of in the philosophy of science. We argue that several current views are misguided in assuming that the epistemology of modeling and simulation must build on a philosophical theory of the representation relation (e.g. isomorphism, similarity). We extend Robert Brandom’s inferentialist account of meaning into scientific representation to argue that representational language is explicatory, not explanatory, in nature. We provide a broader philosophical rationale for inferential accounts of scientific representation, and an epistemologically modest account of the role of models in terms of inferential scorekeeping. We apply these views to the contested case of computer simulations to argue that, although the praxis of simulation modeling resembles that of scientific experimentation, simulations alone cannot lead to genuinely novel discoveries about the world, as they are merely tools for keeping our reasoning straight.",TRUE,FALSE,computer simulation|inferentialism|scientific representation|similarity,2019-06-04T11:27:42.681708,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:08:14.084343,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/citation/,v9bmr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf62a07b700fa001b9fede6/,5cf62a07b700fa001b9fede6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9bmr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9bmr

The aim of the present paper is to investigate how translators deal with English 'there' sentences in two translated Arabic texts. The method adopted in the study is a descriptive-analytic one. In Arabic the words 'hunaaka' and 'tammata' are usually used to render English 'there' ; however, the data of the study show that in many cases translators avoid using  these two words. The flexibility of word order in Arabic , in addition to the use of full lexical verbs , more frequently than English does in 'there' sentences , help to translate these sentences adequately into Arabic. It is also found that syntactic restrictions are not the only reason for the fact that many 'there' sentences are not translated using 'hunaaka' and ' tammata'; the discourse and stylistic levels, play a role in the translator's decision to use other means. In some cases, the use of 'hunaaka /tammata' is shown to be optional and in other cases to be obligatory, unless an alternative construction is produced.

Many theatre scholars and playwrights argue that the value of these plays, which were primarily regarded as fiction or imaginative reconstruction of the past, may prevail over history. Theatre, which is considered the most symbolic form of art, can be historically educative and evocatively accurate. Based on the aforesaid arguments, this study aims to explore the dramaturgicals, theatricals or thespians used in Yerima's Attahiru (1999) in order to repudiate and resist the distorted versions of the colonial history of Sokoto Caliphate in an effective and affective way. To achieve this aim, textual analysis is used by combining its important approaches: author-oriented approach and context-oriented approach. This analysis is significant because the researchers investigated the colonial resistance captured in the play through postcolonial theory. In addition, this paper explores the attitudes of the colonialist and the colonised reproduced in the play and how the play helps in the decolonisation process, as well as how the images of the damaged heroes are reconstructed in the play in order to restore national pride and integrity.

In the Middle Ratanakosin period, one renowned book about India recounted the visit of a young King Rama V of Siam to India to experience and learn from the positive and negative experience of colonized countries. His Majesty was inspired by that visit and reformed Siam (former name of Thailand) into a dynastic state with numerous new economic political and social developments. In the current Ratanakosin period of rampant globalization, “Indianness” presented in the settings and protagonists are plotted in many Thai novels mixing with “Thainess” through Thai or Indian-Thai characterisation and aspects of culture and concepts related to Hinduism and Buddhism. “Dharma” and “Karma” are the main key reflections found in Thai works.

In legal translation which is a special and specialized area of translational activity (Cao, 2007), and where documents are characterized by brevity, economy, and neatness to prevent fraud, additions, omissions or alterations in the text (Crystal &amp; Davy, 1969), mistakes or mistranslations can lead to disastrous repercussions. The present study deals primarily with the methods that translators of legal texts follow and adopt when rendering a legal document. A concise account of translation theories that have been adopted and are still being applied to legal translation is offered to attempt to show the main views towards the application of such translation theories to legal translation. Major methods often used in the translation of legal documents are then presented, discussing their validity to legal translation. This presentation includes literal translation, free translation, the functional approach to translation, transliteration &amp; transcription, loan translation, adaptation, description by definitions, lexical expansion, and descriptive substitution.

These concepts are REWARD, HUMILITY, HYPOCRISY, and ARROGANCE, which recur in many positions in the Qur’an. The researcher takes up selected Qur’anic verses that carry these abstract concepts and analyzes them at two levels: linguistic and conceptual. The study’s main theoretical contribution is to show how a linguistic approach can be transformed into a conceptual one and how this enriches our understanding of abstraction. The linguistic analysis of the verses is supported by translations of Qur’anic meanings, interpretation of the verses, and cultivating the use of Arabic and English dictionaries. To perform the cognitive analysis, the researcher uses Lakoff and Johnson’s Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), which examines metaphor from two domains: the target domain, which is the abstract concept to be explained and the source domain, which is the mental mapping that helps us understand that abstract concept. The study finds that metaphors in the Qur’an are meant to be understood not only linguistically but conceptually too. It concludes by emphasizing the significance of a conceptual approach to the study of metaphor in the Qur’an not only for conceptual metaphor theory but also for the interpretation of the Qur’an and for Arabic linguistics.",TRUE,FALSE,abstract concept|cognitive|conceptual metaphor|linguistic metaphor|Qur’an|source domain|target domain,2019-06-04T11:29:44.560644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:10:37.028496,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/citation/,42gkd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5ed12d987b5001689718c/,5cf5ed12d987b5001689718c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42gkd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42gkd

It tries to answer the following questions: To what extent would using the SCAMPER model raise translation skills among major students in the faculty of education – Majmaah University .the the second question is To what extent would using SCAMPER model raise the attitudes towards translation among major students.To accomplish the purpose of the study, the researcher showed the experimental group with a sample involved (40) students for the SCAMPER Model in the first term of the school year 2018-2019. The researcher used (pre -post &amp; delayed) translation test, a scale of students' attitudes towards translation to collect data. The study's results suggested that there were statistically important differences at (α ≤ 0.05) in the whole mean grade in the pre post translation test to the group in favor of posttest. Also, there were statistically important differences at (α ≤ 0.05) in the whole mean grade in the pre-post scale of students attitudes towards translation to the group in favor of post implication. Also, the researcher recognized these differences in using the SCAMPER Model in teaching English language translation. In light of these outcomes, the study suggested the necessity of applying the SCAMPER Model in teaching the English language to get better results in students’ translation learning and retention in English as a foreign language. Similarly, the SCAMPER Model would be used with other English skills and sub-skills.",TRUE,FALSE,Model|SCAMPER|skills|translation,2019-06-04T11:30:28.613049,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:10:50.628038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/citation/,kngbw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5ec59b700fa001d9f7bdb/,5cf5ec59b700fa001d9f7bdb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kngbw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kngbw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kngbw
