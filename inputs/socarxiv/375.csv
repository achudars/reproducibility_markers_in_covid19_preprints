This study attempts to answer these two questions: what is the pragmatic function of the information tone types that are employed in Obama’s speech concerning the termination component? and what are the pragmatic function of the proclaiming and referring tones that are employed in Obama’s speech concerning the dominance and non-dominance factor?. It aims to investigate the types of information tones in Obama’s speech concerning the termination component and dominance/non-dominance factor based on Brazil’s model (1997) of discourse intonation. This study confines itself to the American political interview and it is a qualitative study. The findings show that all the information tone types (proclaiming, referring, and level) are used in Obama’s speech and the high termination is most common level, which is used by Obama in his speech in order to emphasize the information and capture the attention of the interviewer. Generally, it was found that the dominance factor was higher than the non-dominance factor, which reflects that Obama took his status as the controller of the discourse during his speech with the interviewer and most of his speech carries contrastive information, which contradicts the interview’s expectation.

The experimental group studied an advanced college writing course supported by the creative writing multitasks designed by the researcher. A group of pre and posttest design was applied in the study. When the pre and posttest’s scores of the experimental group were analyzed and compared, it was detected that there was a statistically considerable difference in the pre- and posttest scores, in favor of posttest’s score. Also, it shows that there was a significant difference in the mean scores of the experimental and control group posttest’s scores, favoring the experimental group posttest’s score. These results prove the main research hypothesis: Creative writing multi-tasks have a significant impact on developing the experimental group’s creative writing competence, compared to the control group.

Nevertheless, being proficient in English language guarantees better job opportunities in various fields and thus learners need to acquire an acceptable level of proficiency. Recognizing its significant role in the learners’ academic and professional excellence, the English language has gained the status of a mandatory language in the Saudi higher education institutions. As students enter universities for higher studies, they are often required to take prerequisite courses in English to gain a higher level of proficiency. This qualitatively driven descriptive case study investigated the attitudes of EFL students who were enrolled in the Foundation Year Program. This study aimed to examine the learners’ feelings, emotions, and attitudes in the light of their academic performance. In total, thirteen male and seventeen female students were interviewed using semi-structured interviews as a main tool for the data collection.  They were asked to recall and write their narratives regarding their experience of learning the English language throughout the foundation year program. The socio-constructivist nature of this qualitative case study offered an opportunity to participants to share their stories. Consequently, it highlighted the factors that motivated them for a language learning experience. Moreover, it allowed them to reflect on the challenges that they encountered during their learning odyssey of the English language course as part of the preparatory year program (PYP). Findings from this research study suggest that the participants’ motivations to learn English are primarily related to socio-economic reasons. Besides, students were particularly motivated to learn English when they were encouraged by their families and by ‘good’ teaching practices. Nevertheless, these findings failed to establish an association between the learners’ attitudes and their performance on the assessments during the course. This case study adds to the existing literature by examining a context that lacks empirical evidence on the topic of EFL learners’ beliefs about English learning.

It attempts to redraw the boundaries of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) from a teaching-testing perspective based on two fundamental questions: the ‘what-to-teach’ and the ‘what-to-test’, which represent the rationale of Algerian EFL classrooms. It also expands into a discussion of the discrepancies existing between stated objectives and classroom practice. This deviation from the prescribed syllabus is dictated by the Baccalaureate exam, a standardized test par excellence and the ‘entry visa’ to university. The study was carried out with a sample population composed of twenty-eight male and female students from the English Department of the University of Tlemcen, Algeria during the first term of the academic year 2018-2019. The data collected tools employed in this pilot experimental study, a pre-unit test (a pre-test), remedial activities, and a post-test, were conducted on the sample at the end of the experiment.

The present study investigates the attitudes of L1 Arabic speakers towards the use of English in the L2 classroom. The study examined the following: a) whether Arabic is used in English language classrooms; b) students’ attitudes towards their English teachers’ use of Arabic; c) students’ attitudes towards their classmates’ use of Arabic; d) whether the use of Arabic facilitates L2 English learning. The study was conducted with 149 male Saudi university English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners studying in a Saudi English department. They were asked to complete two questionnaires: a) a background questionnaire; and b) an attitudinal questionnaire. The findings revealed that the participants believed that: a) Arabic is seldom used by their teachers; b) the use of English is more beneficial than Arabic to learning English; and c) Arabic can be used in some situations by teachers when communicating important information.,TRUE,FALSE,Arab EFL learners|attitudes|English classroom|learning|second language|using Arabic,2019-10-11T16:51:03.645532,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:47:56.349677,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/citation/,he7d6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da011cff6b03e000e1bf68a/,5da011cff6b03e000e1bf68a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/he7d6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/he7d6/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/he7d6

This paper aims to investigate the preceded causes of students’ spelling errors. The main research question sought to be answered is: What are the causes of spelling errors made by the Saudi university students?  The research participants were 15 students in the English Language Department at Tabuk University and 15 English language lecturers from the same department. Group structured interviews were designed for the lecturers and students. The findings reveal that there are different causes of students’ spelling errors such as the education system and university syllabus, students’ learning attitude, and the interference between English and Arabic language. This paper concludes that the spelling errors which Saudi university students commit were caused by the negative impacts of their education system and syllabus, where the syllabus ignores the importance of spelling rules and techniques, and the interference between English and Arabic language when the learners refer to their mother tongue while writing in the English language. It is hoped that the findings revealed in this study will help the policymakers in taking necessary actions in improving the learning experience of Arab learners of English. This paper calls for a reform in the English language teaching in Saudi education system so that spelling is given the required emphasis as it is the foundation of English proficiency.",TRUE,FALSE,English language teaching|foreign language learner|Saudi learner|spelling error|vocabulary,2019-10-11T16:50:41.111303,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:47:25.199358,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/citation/,3rje9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da010ef26eb50000e7f8aaa/,5da010ef26eb50000e7f8aaa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rje9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3rje9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3rje9
