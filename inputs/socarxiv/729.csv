for Amanda Visconti's dissertation ""How can you love a work, if you don't
know it?"": Critical Code and Design toward Participatory Digital Editions (
dr.AmandaVisconti.com). The introductory section proposes a speculative
experiment to test digital edition design theories: ""What if we build a
digital edition and invite everyone? What if millions of scholars,
first-time readers, book clubs, teachers and their students show up and
annotate a text with their infinite interpretations, questions, and
contextualizations?"". Approaching digital editions as Morris Eaves'
""problem-solving mechanism""s, the project designed, built, and user-tested
a digital edition of James Joyceâ€™s Ulysses with various experimental
interface features: InfiniteUlysses.com. Three areas of research advanced
through the project are presented: designing public and participatory
edition projects, and whether critical participation is necessary to such
projects; designing digital edition functionalities and appearance to serve
a participatory audience, and what we learn about such an endeavor through
Infinite Ulysses' user experience data; and separating the values of
textual scholarship from their embodiments to imagine new types of edition.
A review of theoretical and built precedents from textual scholarship,
scholarly design and code projects, public and participatory humanities
endeavors, and theories around a digital Ulysses grounds the report,
followed by an overview of the features of the Infinite Ulysses
participatory digital edition. Section 2 discusses existing examples of
public participation in digital humanities (DH) projects, Section 3 focuses
on digital editions and the design process, Section 4 reimagines the
digital edition by separating textual scholarship values from the common
embodiments of these values, and the conclusion sums up the interventions
of this project and lists next steps for continuing this research. A
bibliography and appendices (full texts of user surveys, explanation of
project's dissertational format, wireframes and screenshot from throughout
the design process) conclude the report.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:27.455500,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T18:28:23.355000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/citation/,cbdym,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2z9xr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/relationships/node/,2z9xr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578a7cce6c613b01ee347cb3/,578a7cce6c613b01ee347cb3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cbdym/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cbdym/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cbdym

traditional resources. Purpose-built digital texts are crafted for specific
research purposes, with developer-users and devoted academics comprising
their primary, ""scholar"" audience. A secondary, ""amateur"" audience of
learners with less digital text experience also relies on theses

purpose-built digital texts, by focusing on more experienced users with
direct lines of communication to digital text developers, prevent this
extension of benefits? This study gauged one subgroup of amateur users'
perceptions of the value of digital texts in terms of answering
self-generated research queries. The participants, graduate students from
the University of Michigan's information master's program, worked with a
digital text and completed a survey assessing their experience of digital
text features and perception of their learning success. An analysis of the
survey data produces an introductory understanding of amateur users'
perceptions of their digital text use, their design needs, and their
success or failure at learning through digital texts. The narrative
responses suggest that while the idea of new learning from digital texts is
foreign to the amateur audience, their assessment of digital text features
was not particularly marked by their amateur status. This result suggests
that designing purpose-built digital texts to serve both digital text

Their efforts have met with resistance at each of these points, however, because they have failed to appreciate the insight articulated by Michel Foucault that governing people, in the broad sense, is not only a matter of making them behave; it's also a matter of making them want to behave. This article surveys a decade's worth of anti-piracy regulation and examines the ways in which the entertainment industry's recourse to coercion at every point of intervention has functioned to undermine rather than advance the anti-piracy cause.

Lime Group pending in federal district court in New York, then New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo began pressuring broadband providers to agree voluntarily to play a greater role in fighting online infringement. Subsequently, the Obama administration, represented nationally by the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) and internationally by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), expressly endorsed the concept of privately negotiated anti-piracy collaborations between corporate rights owners and broadband providers.

In July of 2011, broadband providers finally bowed to the mounting political pressure and to changing economic realities in the business of corporate content ownership and delivery. Five of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with trade groups representing major corporate copyright owners. The MOU creates what the parties characterize as a common framework of 'best practices' to effectively alert subscribers, protect copyrighted content and promote access to legal online content.

This Article is an assessment of the MOU's Copyright Alert System (CAS) with respect to five norms that are central to consumer protection in the enterprise of online copyright enforcement: freedom of expression, privacy, fairness, proportionality, and transparency. Part I provides an introduction to graduated response, which is the genus of online copyright enforcement to which CAS belongs. Part II takes a comparative look at two pre-existing graduated response systems: the government mandated and administered program in France, Hadopi, and a privately administered program in Ireland run by the broadband provider Eircom. Part III provides a detailed overview of CAS, including the structure by which it is governed, the division of labor it prescribes between copyright owners and broadband providers, the progression of warnings and sanctions it implements, and the appeals process it makes available for affected broadband subscribers. Part IV evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of CAS with respect to each of the five norms listed above, using the systems in France and Ireland as reference points.

In this paper I look at how Asian immigrant parentsâ€™ own marital decisions shape their understanding of their childrenâ€™s marriageability and race in the U.S. I introduce an analytical framework that I call â€˜marital boundary-makingâ€™ to show how differences between â€˜marriageable usâ€™ and â€˜undesirable themâ€™ are perceived by individuals in different family positions. I use data from 35 interviews with Taiwan-origin immigrant parents residing in San Diego to show how structural assimilation does not necessarily lead to white desirability, even among immigrants who have collectively achieved high socioeconomic status. I found that while the intermarried parents described a color-blind type of marital boundary that plays down race, the coethnic parents expressed a preference hierarchy with Taiwanese at the top. Neither group expressed a strong preference for whites. Further, even though the parentsâ€™ marriageable perceptions were inconsistent, their undesirable interpretations were identicalâ€”evidence of a black/non-black racial divide. The findings challenge the assumption commonly found in immigration studies that intermarriage with whites represents a form of social mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:11.489011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T12:26:35.287000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/citation/,m98hy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hxp6n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/relationships/node/,hxp6n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578a27fdb83f6901f0c062ef/,578a27fdb83f6901f0c062ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m98hy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m98hy

However, the underlying philosophical basis for this system of rewards has gone largely unexamined. For example, implicit in the intellectual property system is a strong element of mind/body dualism that informs the incentives for technological development. In copyright, the work created and owned by an author is idealized as an intangible form, which may be embodied or fixed in a tangible medium of expression. The parallel patent law doctrine of inventorship shows an even more striking pattern of dualism. In the United States patent priority is decided primarily on the basis of conception of the invention in the mind of the inventor; the actual building or reduction to practice of the invention is held largely irrelevant.

Similarly, both patent and copyright doctrine entail a strong element of nature/culture dualism. In patent law, this manifests as the product of nature doctrine, holding that only the products of human effort are patentable, and not discoveries drawn from nature. In copyright, facts and other natural occurrences are excluded from copyright as being unoriginal, that is, not originating from the creativity of an author. Both systems assume that facts or properties embedded in the fabric of reality can be separated from the human activity that observes and defines such facts and properties.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,authorship|conception|copyright|dualism|feminist jurisprudence|fixation|innovation|intellectual property|materiality|mental steps|patent|patriarchy|Preprint|reduction to practice|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:05.622152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T04:13:01.019000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/citation/,jhcym,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r3b88/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/relationships/node/,r3b88,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5789b44e594d9001ef859f53/,5789b44e594d9001ef859f53,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jhcym/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jhcym

Information law, including the law of privacy and of intellectual property, is especially likely to benefit from a coherent and comprehensive theory of information ethics. This article illustrates how information ethics might apply to legal doctrine, by examining legal questions related to the ownership and control of the personal data representations, including photographs, game avatars, and consumer profiles, that have become ubiquitous with the proliferation of information and communication technologies. Recent controversy over the control of player performance statistics in ""fantasy"" sports leagues provides a limiting case for the analysis. Such data representations will in many instances constitute the kind of personal data that information ethics asserts constitutes an information entity. Legal doctrine in some instances proves sympathetic to such an assertion, but remains largely inchoate as to which data might constitute a given information entity in a given instance.

This model of licensing has now migrated to the field of biotechnology, where patents rather than copyrights dominate proprietary rights. Consequently, a model for open source patenting or free biotechnology presents a constellation of legal issues not typically found in previous open source licensing. This paper discusses several of these issues, including the nature of the rights transferred, the activities that may trigger the terms of the license, and the legal prohibitions on certain forms of licensing.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:29.904926,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T04:03:52.891000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/citation/,ct8jq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2apxe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/relationships/node/,2apxe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5789b22ab83f6901f3c06372/,5789b22ab83f6901f3c06372,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ct8jq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ct8jq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ct8jq

Some courts have drawn on the law of copyright to conclude that because copyright protects expression, and software is copyrightable, that software must contain protected expression. But because of the recent expansion of patent doctrine to encompass software and other digital communications, it appears that such ""speech"" will also be patentable. Patent law is even more poorly equipped than copyright to distinguish function from expression. The paper reviews the likely problems inherent in applying patent law to expressive subject matter, and suggests the doctrinal changes that may be required to accommodate First Amendment interests in patentable speech.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,copyright|expression|fair use|First Amendment|intellectual property|patent|Preprint|socarxiv|software,2018-07-02T10:48:25.321129,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T03:52:51.093000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/citation/,bk76h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bupps/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/relationships/node/,bupps,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5789af95594d9001f3859eb7/,5789af95594d9001f3859eb7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk76h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bk76h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bk76h
