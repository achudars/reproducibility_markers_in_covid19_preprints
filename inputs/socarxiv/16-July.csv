Using a variety of different recent datasets and -tools, the paper exposes a surprisingly high number of glaring weaknesses and holes. The paper’s first, more ‘technical’, section presents compelling evidence that the volume, velocity, collegiality and uptake of publicly available scientific insights into ‘security deterrence’ remain decidedly suboptimal – also compared to the other scientific disciplines that have examined human deterrence.  The data on the scientific thoroughness of this field also paint a discomfortingly bleak picture, albeit less conclusively so. The paper’s second, more substantive section equally painfully highlights what it calls the field’s unbearable empirical lightness; conceptual confusion and cacophony (even within language domains); as well as multiple major (highly relevant) epistemic holes and other weaknesses. The paper concludes with some recommendations on how the epistemic community working on these issues as well as the academic and policy communities that fund much of this research can build on uniquely promising new developments in the access to (especially also textual) data to build and validate more granular and trustworthy datasets; in humans’ newfound ability to interact with machine algorithms to semantically parse texts to discover and validate ‘knowledge’ in unprecedented ways; but also – in a more mundane mode – to start incentivizing more organically collaborative ways of knowledge building.",TRUE,FALSE,Deterrence|Russian defense policy,2021-06-19T22:21:03.196594,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-19T22:20:42.424561,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://rizzoma.com/topic/194a9c875127f4bac9a94bdbbdec9b78/,available,NA,https://rizzoma.com/topic/194a9c875127f4bac9a94bdbbdec9b78/,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d93|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Peace and Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Defense and Security Studies",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/citation/,yhf93,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/69cm2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/relationships/node/,69cm2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cd48fc3972e40073396fb7/,60cd48fc3972e40073396fb7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhf93/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yhf93/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yhf93

Thus, there is currently a high degree of public interest regarding how these changes in policy might affect recidivism rates of released offenders. When considering the research on the relationship between incarceration and recidivism, many studies compare custodial with non-custodial sentences on recidivism, while fewer examine the impact of varying incarceration lengths on recidivism. This article provides a review of the research on the latter. While some findings suggest that longer sentences may provide additional deterrent benefit in the aggregate, this effect is not always consistent or strong. In addition, many of the studies had null effects, while none of the studies suggested a strong aggregate-level criminogenic effect. Overall, the literature on the impact of incarceration on recidivism is admittedly limited by important methodological considerations, resulting in inconsistency of findings across studies. In addition, it appears that deterrent effects of incarceration may vary slightly for different offenders. Ultimately, the effect of incarceration length on recidivism appears too heterogenous to be able to draw universal conclusions. We argue that a deepened understanding of the causal mechanisms at play is needed to reliably and accurately inform policy.",TRUE,FALSE,custodial sentence|deterrence|incarceration|incarceration length|prison|recidivism|sentencing policy,2021-06-19T22:16:02.678421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-19T22:15:30.118016,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/citation/,eqtzp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ccf9676bd0d1005726c862/,60ccf9676bd0d1005726c862,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eqtzp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eqtzp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eqtzp

We explore an empirical approach to studying the implications of managers’ perceptions and attitudes towards science and R&amp;D on firms’ engagement in innovation. Research is based on the survey ‘Scientific culture, perception and attitudes towards science and innovation in the business sector’. Results evidence that corporate innovation decisions are not just a matter of money, and confirms the combined effect of a firm’s economic characteristics and perception of science on innovation engagement. Results confirm that managers’ attitude towards science and R&amp;D is related to firms’ commitment to innovation, suggesting that their attitudes and behaviour in relation to science and investment in R&amp;D should be given a more prominent role in S&amp;T and innovation studies and in developing models of innovation in the future. This study provides some important implications for the management of innovation in the business sector. It stresses that innovation is related with managers having a perception of science and R&amp;D that paves the way for the allocation of a firm’s resources to activities oriented towards knowledge generation and innovation.

Existing accounts of public attitudes focus on egalitarian values and material interests, but make little mention of the ideas people hold about how the economy works descriptively.

Positive-sum thinking is associated with less progressive preferences. However, despite theoretical attention, there is no evidence of systematic zero-sum thinking among the public. On the other hand, some descriptions focus on conflict between rich and poor, and these do predict support for greater progressivity.

Di- rected networks provide a way to examine the structure of reciprocity in a community. However, measuring social networks involves assumptions about what relationships matter and how to elicit them, which may impact observed reciprocity. In particular, the practice of aggregating multiple sources of data on the same relationship (e.g., “double-sampled” data, where both the “giver” and “re- ceiver” are asked to report on their relationship) may have pronounced impacts on network structure. To investigate these issues, we examine concordance (ties reported by both parties) and reciprocity in a set of directed, double-sampled social support networks. We find low concordance in people’s responses. Taking either the union (including any reported ties) or the intersection (including only concordant ties) of double-sampled relationships results in dramatically higher levels of reciprocity. Using multilevel exponential random graph models of social support networks from 75 villages in India, we show that these changes cannot be fully explained by the changes in density resulting from aggregation. Respondents’ tendency to name the same people as both givers and receivers of support plays an important role, but this tendency varies across contexts and relationships type.

For academics, casualised and precarious, the sweeping institutional changes of contemporary neoliberal universities, the sharp rise in managerialism, and the political power plays of universities have created further untenable spaces for work and study. In this article we explore the relationship between doctoral studies, precarious academic employment, the pandemic, and the disproportionate effects of the changes in higher education on women. Through exploration of personal experience, as precarious academic workers, researchers, and doctoral students, we provide parallels to research literature across pandemic and post-COVID literature. We provide practical suggestions for the corporate university, to rebuild its catastrophically collapsing systems, and re-centre doctoral students in mentorship as the new future of universities in Australia, and around the world.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Economism|Governance|Higher Education|Knowledge economy|Managerialism|Precariat|Women|Work,2021-06-19T01:47:22.261343,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-19T01:46:57.328496,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/citation/,acu4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7qz3x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/relationships/node/,7qz3x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cc54166bd0d10020271cf4/,60cc54166bd0d10020271cf4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acu4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acu4n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/acu4n

Following Boyd et al. (2000), we derive the Marshall–Lerner condition mathematically and analyze the effects of home and foreign trade policies, such as the minimum access and quantitative trade restriction, on the Marshall–Lerner condition. In conclusion, such trade policies make the condition theoretically difficult to hold since the marginal effects of the Tobit estimates under deterministic trade policies are always lower than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates under no trade policies in absolute values.",TRUE,FALSE,Marshall–Lerner Condition|Micro-foundation|Tobit model|Trade balance|Trade policy,2021-06-18T06:53:40.763785,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:53:15.453585,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/citation/,njzk3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cc2aa23972e4001a391e9b/,60cc2aa23972e4001a391e9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/njzk3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/njzk3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/njzk3

Naturally, this complexity has trickled into the Medium of Instruction (MOI) used in Indian schools. Hindi, English, and state languages dominate the school MOI undermining the enormous Language and Mother Tongue diversity in India. Even though the Indian Constitution and the three National Education Policies have emphasized Mother Tongue/Local language as the MOI at the primary education level, there continues to be a divergence between policy and the actual MOI used in government and private schools in India. In this article, we argue that the political hegemony of languages and its reflection in the MOI at present derives from the historic domination of classical languages in the pre-colonial era and its replacement by English in the colonial era. We trace the MOI in indigenous schools of the 19th Century and assert that their elasticity and adaptability was suited to local conditions. We argue that formal western education created rigidity and homogeneity through centralized curriculum and common language. We discuss the ambivalence of East India Company and British India’s policies on medium of Instruction in English and Vernacular languages. We highlight different phases of anglicization of Education in India, and its adoption and expansion by Indians. We argue that despite attempts at reinvention of education by national leaders and push for Mother Tongue as MOI in the early 20th century, English continued to dominate Indian education.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-18T06:53:40.819866,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:53:34.084488,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d52|Education|Language and Literacy Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d53|Education|Indigenous Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d54|Education|Elementary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/citation/,w9j7x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cc27a03972e4001a391776/,60cc27a03972e4001a391776,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w9j7x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w9j7x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w9j7x
