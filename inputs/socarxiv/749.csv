The 2010 Census Match Study and American Community Survey (ACS) Match Study represent recent efforts by the Census Bureau to evaluate the extent to which administrative records provide data on persons and addresses in the 2010 Census and 2010 ACS. The 2010 Census Match Study also examines demographic response data collected in administrative records. Building on this analysis, we match data from the 2010 ACS to federal administrative records and third party data as well as to previous census data and examine administrative records coverage and agreement of ACS age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin responses.

To what extent do race and/or Hispanic origin responses change? Is change more common to/from some race/ethnic groups than others? Does the propensity to change responses vary by characteristics of the individual? To what extent do these changes affect researchers? We use internal Census Bureau data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses in which individuals’ responses have been linked across years. Approximately 9.8 million people (about 6 percent) in our large, non-representative linked data have a different race and/or Hispanic origin response in 2010 than they did in 2000. Several groups experienced considerable fluidity in racial identification: American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and multiple-race response groups, as well as Hispanics when reporting a race. In contrast, race and ethnic responses for single-race non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians were relatively consistent over the decade, as were ethnicity responses by Hispanics. People who change their race and/or Hispanic origin response(s) are doing so in a wide variety of ways, as anticipated by previous research. For example, people’s responses change from multiple races to a single race, from a single race to multiple races, from one single race to another, and some people add or drop a Hispanic response. The inflow of people to each race/Hispanic group is in many cases similar in size to the outflow from the same group, such that cross-sectional data would show a small net change. We find response changes across ages, sexes, regions, and response modes, with variation across groups.

They respectively represent precedents and followers of contemporary Chinese-speaking migrants to the U.S. A major finding is that while Taiwanese immigrants tend to develop an exclusive identity formation process, the Chinese process entails inclusivity. I argue that this within-group difference has its roots in pre-migration conditions. Ethnic polarization in Taiwan has generated and sustained a political form of hyphenated-American identity, a process in which “Taiwanese,” “Chinese” and “Asian” are perceived as mutually exclusive categories of identity. The lack of an equivalent pre-migration event for Chinese immigrants has resulted in the formation of a culturally hyphenated identity in which “Chinese” is interpreted as a symbolic ethnicity that complements Asian panethnicity. By addressing the enduring effects of homeland politics on immigrant identity, this study challenges existing ideas on associations among time/length of stay, culture/common language, and immigrant integration.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:46:23.596524,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-15T14:19:27.613000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/citation/,53665,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5b46v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/relationships/node/,5b46v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58766b606c613b01fb6d0b07/,58766b606c613b01fb6d0b07,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53665/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/53665/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/53665,NA

Coming from the idea of “code as law” the shift from technology governing online spaces to physical spaces is described as a new phenomenon. They call it ‘Governance by Things’. Some key observations of this structural shift are characterised in this article, for instance regarding its self-executing character and the imperfection of technology. Finally, the authors draw the conclusion that the ‘Governance by Things’ calls for a second-order regulation.

Analyses of these data allow for new insights into movement emergence, consequences, and tactical innovation and adaptation. One of the issues with this kind of analysis, however, is that the generation of event data is incredibly costly. Human coders must pore through news sources, looking for instances of protest and coding many variables by hand. Because of the high labor costs, projects are typically limited to one or two newspapers per country. This, in turn, exacerbates issues of selection and description biases.

This article aims to address this issue with the development, validation, and application of a system for automating the generation of protest event data. This system, called the Machine-Learning Protest Event Data System (MPEDS), is the first of its kind coming from within the social movement community. MPEDS uses recent innovations from machine learning and natural language processing to generate protest event data with little to no human intervention. The system aims to have the effect of increasing the speed and reducing the labor costs associated with identifying and coding collective action events in news sources, thus increasing the timeliness of protest data and reducing biases due to excessive reliance on too few news sources. Work on MPEDS is ongoing, and to that end, the system will also be open, available for replication, and extendable by future social movement researchers, and social and computational scientists.",TRUE,FALSE,machine learning|nlp|protest event data|social movements|text analysis,2018-07-02T10:55:01.753647,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-10T16:47:39.705000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/citation/,xuqmv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sk5ab/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/relationships/node/,sk5ab,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58750fc4b83f6902020665aa/,58750fc4b83f6902020665aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xuqmv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xuqmv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xuqmv,NA

A test of five diversity indices in Germany,"An ever-growing number of studies investigates the relation between ethnic diversity and social cohesion, but these studies have produced mixed results. In cross-national research, some scholars have recently started to investigate more refined and informative indices of ethnic diversity than the commonly used Hirschman-Herfindahl Index. These refined indices allow to test competing theoretical explanations of why ethnic diversity is associated with declines in social cohesion. This study assesses the applicability of this approach for sub-national analyses. Generally, the results confirm a negative association between social cohesion and ethnic diversity. However, the competing indices are empirically indistinguishable and thus insufficient to test different theories against one another. Follow-up simulations suggest the general conclusion that the competing indices are meaningful operationalizations only if a sample includes: (1) contextual units with small and contextual units with large minority shares, as well as (2) contextual units with diverse and contextual units with polarized ethnic compositions. The results are thus instructive to all researchers who wish to apply different diversity indices and thereby test competing theories.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity indices|entropy|ethnic diversity|Germany|immigration|SocArXiv|social capital|social cohesion,2018-07-02T10:53:43.154529,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-10T12:50:23.466000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,Elsevier,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/citation/,upucm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pm2zh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/relationships/node/,pm2zh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5874d5f3b83f6901fe0663f0/,5874d5f3b83f6901fe0663f0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/upucm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/upucm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/upucm,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.12.018

Islamic banking and finance, research in this area still needs to be classified as
nascent. Recent economic events have led to an increasingly critical attitude
towards the conventional banking and finance system, whereas Islamic banking is
considered to be an ethical alternative not only in Muslim economies but also
progressively in the “western” world. As their business models have their origins
in religious and ethical ideals, Islamic banks struggle to observe the foundational
Shariah principles while simultaneously meeting applicable guidelines such as
Basel III and flexibly adapt to the ever changing customer demands. Due to the
increasing importance of Islamic banking and finance, this article aims to analyse

In the current study, 2 waves of the Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics data (n = 2,937) were used to test the gendered association between economic factors and relationship satisfaction among young German couples. In contrast to U.S.- based studies, the findings showed striking gender differences in the association between economic factors and relationship satisfaction for Germans. In cross-sectional models, women’s relationship satisfaction was positively associated with receiving government economic support, and men’s satisfaction was positively associated with poverty status and negatively associated with being a breadwinner. Longitudinal models revealed that changes in poverty status are associated with women’s satisfaction, but men’s satisfaction remains tied to their role as family provider. These unexpected results suggest that men’s satisfaction is positively associated with a more equal division of labor market activity between partners.",TRUE,FALSE,economic factors|family|gender|preprints|relationship satisfaction|romantic relationships,2018-07-02T10:52:10.012556,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-09T01:06:26.069000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/citation/,takv5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yr3by/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/relationships/node/,yr3by,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5872e0e36c613b01feac694d/,5872e0e36c613b01feac694d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/takv5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/takv5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/takv5,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12129

At the same time, economics displaced law as the dominant form of antitrust expertise. While these developments are related, the former cannot be reduced to the latter: the median position in economics itself shifted from high-enforcement to low-enforcement during this period, and by its end was moving back toward more enforcement. To understand the relationship between these changes, this paper conceptualizes academic economics and antitrust policy as linked fields with relative autonomy. Though economics came to play a key role in antitrust policy, its influence was in some ways limited. The academic field was itself shaped, though not determined, by outside political interests. In addition, not all academically influential ideas translated equally well into policy. A wide range of economists shared a commitment to efficiency as the main purpose of antitrust, however, which delegitimized other historical goals of antitrust policy and constrained political possibilities in lasting ways.",TRUE,FALSE,antitrust|economics|economic sociology|expertise|policy|political sociology|sociology of knowledge,2018-07-02T10:51:50.310469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-01-08T18:30:14.357000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/citation/,qhgdk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpzyu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/relationships/node/,tpzyu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5872843f9ad5a101ff8b0eb0/,5872843f9ad5a101ff8b0eb0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhgdk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qhgdk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qhgdk,NA
