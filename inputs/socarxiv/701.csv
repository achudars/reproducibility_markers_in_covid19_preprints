criticisms are complicated by the rather surprising fact that we don't
actually know what percentage of patent applications actually issue as
patents. In this paper, we use a novel dataset of all published patent
applications filed in January 2001 to estimate the grant rate. These data
also allow us to examine the uses of continuation applications, and to
assess dynamics of applicant-examiner interaction over the patent
prosecution process. We find that the PTO rejects a surprisingly high
percentage of patents. While more than two-thirds of all applications
result in at least one patent, a significant number of applications are
rejected and then finally abandoned by the applicant. We also find that the
likelihood of obtaining a patent varies significantly by industry, but in
surprising ways. Finally, despite a variety of reforms that might be
thought to reduce the use and abuse of continuation applications, we find a
high use of continuation applications of various types.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:27.246069,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:19:52.887000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/citation/,67ft5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zxva7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/relationships/node/,zxva7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be0f7ab83f6901f165649c/,57be0f7ab83f6901f165649c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ft5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/67ft5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/67ft5

theory. The result is that free riding claims fall back on empty
circularity. Those free riding arguments are - explicitly or implicitly -

reading patent applications and determining which ones qualify for patent
protection. It is a Herculean task, and the Patent Office pursues it
subject to enormous informational and budgetary constraints. Nonetheless,
under current law, courts are bound to defer to the Patent Office's
decisions regarding patent validity. In this Article, we argue for reform.
Deference to previous decision-makers is appropriate in instances where
those previous decisions have a high likelihood of accuracy, and the patent
system should endeavor to create processes that fit this mold. But granting
significant deference to the initial process of patent review is
indefensible and counter-productive. Patents should be vulnerable to
challenge until and unless they are significantly evaluated in an
information-rich environment. At that point, they will have earned and
therefore should be accorded a presumption of validity. Such an approach
would better serve the patent's systems long-run incentive goals, and it
would give patent applicants better incentives to file for genuine
inventions but leave their more obvious and incremental accomplishments
outside the patent system's purview. Here, we therefore suggest the
creation of a two-tier system of patent validity, with patents that are
subject to intensive scrutiny accorded a strong presumption of validity,

independent development. To infringe a copyright or trade secret,
defendants must copy the protected IP from the plaintiff, directly or
indirectly. But patent infringement requires only that the defendant's
product falls within the scope of the patent claims. Not only doesn't the
defendant need to intend to infringe, but the defendant may be entirely
unaware of the patent or the patentee and still face liability.

Nonetheless, copying does play a role in some subsidiary patent doctrines.
For example, the question of whether patent damages should be set in order
to deter infringement depends critically on whether infringers are in fact
aware they are infringing, or at least that they are using the plaintiff's
technology. Copying - or at least intent to infringe - is also an element
of claims for indirect infringement. The definition of ""willful
infringement"" also turns on the question of culpability, at least in the
popular understanding of that term. More significantly, the rhetoric of
patent law (and of IP law more generally) often seems to presuppose that
defendants in patent cases are in fact engaged in copying. Similarly, the
outcome of public policy debates over patent reform may well turn on the
perception of patent infringers as either bad actors or as innocent
businesspeople who accidentally ran afoul of a patent.

Unfortunately, no one seems to know whether patent infringement defendants
are in fact unscrupulous copyists or independent developers. In this paper,
we seek to answer that question. Because copying is not an element of any
patent cause of action, courts do not normally make explicit findings as to
whether defendants have copied. Instead, we turn to a variety of proxies to
try to identify the subset of cases in which copying is alleged or proven.
We look both at the allegations made in a random sample of complaints and
at the treatment of copying in recent reported decisions. We find that a
surprisingly small percentage of patent cases involve even allegations of
copying, much less proof of copying. Copying in patent law seems to be the
exception, not the rule.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:36.746246,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T19:05:56.763000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/citation/,anz2u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v8djb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/relationships/node/,v8djb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bdf0169ad5a101fa68da32/,57bdf0169ad5a101fa68da32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/anz2u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/anz2u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/anz2u

determine the meaning of claim terms varies depending on what legal rule is
at issue. Where the question is one of novelty or nonobviousness - whether
the invention is truly new - the courts compare the patented invention to
the prior art as both were understood at the time of the invention. Where
the question is one of enablement or written description - whether the
inventor understood and described the invention in sufficient detail -
courts evaluate the adequacy of the disclosure based on the meaning of the
claims at the time the patent application was filed. Where the question
involves the meaning of a special patent claim element called a
means-plus-function claim, courts evaluate the scope of that claim element
at the time the patent issues. And where the question involves alleged
infringement of the patent, courts evaluate infringement in at least some
circumstances based on the meaning of the claim at the time of
infringement.

An equally fundamental principle of patent law is that patent claims must
be construed as an integrated whole. In particular, patentees (or accused
infringers, for that matter) are not permitted to argue that a patent claim
means one thing when it comes to validity and something else entirely when
it comes to infringement. Instead, courts give claims a single meaning in
any given case, engaging in only one act of claim construction for any
given patent.

These two principles contradict each other. In this paper, I seek to
resolve this conflict. In Part I of this paper, I document the
distinguished pedigree of both principles. In Part II, I argue that patent
claim terms should have a fixed meaning throughout time, and that that
meaning should be fixed at the time the patent application is first filed.
Part II also discusses some complications that arise as a result of the
prosecution process, and how to deal with the problem of later-developed
technology.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:08.824996,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:17:52.391000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/citation/,fxgev,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ed6ku/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/relationships/node/,ed6ku,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde4d16c613b01eed937a9/,57bde4d16c613b01eed937a9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgev/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxgev/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxgev
