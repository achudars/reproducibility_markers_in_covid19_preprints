However, their real role in battle is still a matter of discussion. Historical sources suggest that their impact in the efficiency of the Roman battle line was highly disproportionate to their individual actions, considering their low numbers. In the past decades a number of authors have proposed different descriptive models to explain their relevance, highlighting factors such as an improvement on unit cohesion or high levels of aggressiveness, which made them lead the charges against the enemy. However, the lack of a quantitative framework does not allow to compare and test these working hypotheses.

This paper suggests an innovative methodological approach to explore the problem, based on computer simulation. An Agent-Based Model of roman legions is used as a virtual laboratory, where different hypotheses are tested under varying scenarios. Results suggest that the resilience of formations to combat stress increase exponentially if they contain just a small percentage of homogeneously distributed warriors with higher psychological resistance. Additionally, the model also shows how the lethality of the entire formation is reinforced when this selected group is located at the first line of the formation, even if individually they are not more aggressive or skilled than the average.

The interpretation of the simulated patterns in terms of Roman warfare suggest that the multiple roles of the centurions observed in the sources were not caused by changes in tactics or values, but can be strictly explained by an increase in their experience and overall combat performance.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-Based Models|centurions|military history|Roman history,2018-07-02T10:59:31.125346,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-08T10:48:29.717803,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce4|Arts and Humanities|History|Military History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d29|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d2a|Arts and Humanities|Classics|Classical Archaeology and Art History,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/citation/,cqj4d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c8m6s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/relationships/node/,c8m6s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593929909ad5a1022d610198/,593929909ad5a1022d610198,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cqj4d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cqj4d/,https://doi.org/10.1162/JINH_a_00833,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cqj4d

The OECD adopts a principal of objective behavioral—non-agency—analysis of economic activity, which is impracticable and unworkable. The OECD denies that accurate legal contracts accurately delineate legal relationship. This implies an inherent fraud in corporate business management, which if true would be criminal in most countries—the OECD is implying everything in writing is a lie. The OECD denies the tax implications of principle-agent legal agency relationships as defined by contract law in its transfer pricing recommendations. On the other hand, the U.S. Tax Court still looks to the agency relationships between corporate entities. The U.S. Tax Court follows the correct approach.
Corporate management can be divided between principle and agents. People usually think about management and shareholders, but there are also risk managers and asset managers that can be bifurcated. In terms of management, the bottom of the hierarchy is the managers of the factories. The capital fund managers or the shareholders have all the power—it will be taxed here not at the managers of the factories. The managers at the top of the hierarchy will get the highest level of remuneration. Reliance on contract is the only way that makes sense. Tax is based on legal—rather than equitable—matters. How would one tax equity?
Two polar opposites define the alternative approaches to the proper appraisal of income for purposes of taxation for transfer pricing.  On the one hand, the United States Tax Court has focused largely on contractual language and terms of agreement. On the other, hand the OECD through BEPS jurisdictions (most of the rest of the world where policies have been formulated) choose to analyze actual economic behavior and reality independent of the mere words chosen by the parties.
Globalization and technology have greater importance in our daily lives every day. As technology and industrial processes grow every day, technology leads to greater globalization, and greater globalization of supply chains leads to more efficient and efficient technology. For example, years ago, heart problems would lead to death, but now small “battery” type instruments (pacemakers) can prevent heart attacks. The examples of the health benefits from technology are endless.
As technology becomes greater and more efficient, globalization has also created supply chains and industrial production processes that are no longer local. As global supply chains increase in complexity, profits need to be properly allocated to certain jurisdictions for taxation purposes—to raise revenue support government functions for society’s benefit. This is a fundamental issue of international taxation. The leading principle for the allocation is the arm’s length principle, according to which related enterprises must charge prices that would have been charged in the open market. Although the principle’s goal aims at avoiding profit shifting, multinational enterprises for years used to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions to avoid taxes in high tax jurisdictions. In the early part of the 21st century increased to attention to these phenomena has lead to the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project to combat this harmful tax competition. This is the most groundbreaking change to the international tax treaty framework since the 1920s—that was initially set up to facilitate cross-border trade. This BEPS project has led to fundamental proposals—as a type of model law—to change the international tax system.",TRUE,FALSE,International LAw|International Tax|International Tax Law|Law|Public International Law|Tax|Taxation|Transfer Pricing,2018-07-02T10:59:30.923205,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-07T21:39:44.820358,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1e|Law|Taxation-Transnational,Charles Lincoln,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/citation/,3fs5x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zfrxs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/relationships/node/,zfrxs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59387258b83f6902297c7b46/,59387258b83f6902297c7b46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3fs5x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3fs5x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3fs5x

The strike was called in opposition to a 75 per cent increase in university tuition fees announced by Québec’s Liberal government under then-Premier, Jean Charest. From February 2012 until the following September, the streets of Montreal, Québec City and other towns in the province were alive with demonstrations and protest actions. Students walked out of class and stayed out, picketing their academic institutions and even holding barricades against police intervention; over 3,000 people were arrested over the course of those few months, new repressive laws were introduced and resisted, and solidarity between groups and across sectors was built and tested.
The aim of this book is both to provide a glimpse into the lived experience of this social movement for the benefit of those who were not a part of it, and to uncover some of the lessons that can be garnered from a reflexive look back at the movement. It brings together contributions by students and non-students, academics, parents, activists, anarchists, artists, and others, most of which were written as the mass mobilizations began to subside in the fall of 2012. The book is meant to be accessible to a wide audience, including those without previous knowledge of the 2012 strike or the Québec context. It is our hope that the information and ideas shared in the chapters that follow will inspire and inform reflection and future social movement action in Québec and elsewhere.

This project represents a massive undertaking – it is billed as the largest drinking water project in the world – and is part of a broader predilection toward large, concrete-heavy supply-side solutions to water insecurity across present-day India. This paper tracks the claims and narratives used to promote the project, the political context in which it has emerged, the purposes it serves and, following Ferguson (1990), the functioning of the discursive-bureaucratic 'machine' of which it is a product.
The dam’s reinvention as the solution to Gujarat’s drinking water shortfall – increasingly for cities and Special Industrial Regions – reflects a concern with attracting and retaining foreign investment through the creation of so-called 'world-class' infrastructure. At the same time, this reinvention has contributed to a project of nation-building, while remaining cloaked in a discourse of technological neutrality. The heavy infrastructure renders visible Gujarat’s commitment to 'development' even when that promise has yet to be realised for many, while the promise of Narmada water gives Gujarat’s leaders political capital with favoured investors and political supporters. In conclusion, I suggest that the success of infrastructure mega-projects as a political tool is not intrinsically tied to their ability to achieve their technical and social objectives. Instead, the 'spectacle' of ambitious infrastructural development projects may well yield political gains that outweigh, for a time, the real-world costs of their inequity and unsustainability.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-politics|Development|Gujarat|Narmada pipeline project|Sardar Sarovar Dam,2018-07-02T10:59:30.543199,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-07T14:58:45.694386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d17|Arts and Humanities|South and Southeast Asian Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/citation/,ewa8b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vr8hs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/relationships/node/,vr8hs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59381261b83f69022b7c6bf5/,59381261b83f69022b7c6bf5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewa8b/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewa8b

Scant attention, however, has been paid to associations between religious participation and safety risks among adolescents. Using data from Add Health (N = 18,449), a nationally representative school-based sample of US adolescents, this study examines the relationship between adolescents’ religious affiliation and easy access to firearms at home. Regression analyses adjust for complex sampling design and compare easy firearm access at home among conservative Protestant adolescents to adolescent firearm access in other religious traditions. Conservative Protestant adolescents have a substantially greater likelihood of easy access to a gun at home compared to adolescents of all other major religious traditions in the United States. Recognizing differences in adolescent firearm access between subcultural groups can help public health interventions more effectively identify and address the needs of vulnerable populations. The paper’s conclusion considers suggestions for effective policy and programmatic initiatives.",TRUE,FALSE,adolescents|children|conservative Protestantism|firearms|guns|religion|risk|safety|sociology of religion|teens,2018-07-02T10:59:30.504953,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-07T12:29:04.465035,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb6|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Christianity|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb9|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Christian Denominations and Sects|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d60|Education|Health and Physical Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/citation/,kns57,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dw5n8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/relationships/node/,dw5n8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5937efed594d900234586305/,5937efed594d900234586305,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kns57/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kns57/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2017.06.001,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kns57
