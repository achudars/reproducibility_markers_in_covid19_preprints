equivalents decision in both the Federal Circuit and the district courts
during three periods - one before the Federal Circuit's 2000 Festo opinion,
one after that opinion but before the Supreme Court's 2002 opinion, and a
third after the Supreme Court's opinion. Two broader findings stand out.
First, the multiple changes in the doctrine of equivalents rules over the
last ten years have had surprisingly little effect on the actual outcome of
doctrine of equivalents cases, and even less effect on the subset of cases
dealing directly with prosecution history estoppel. Indeed, to the extent
there is any relationship it is an inverse one - patentees did better under
less patent-friendly rules. The attention everyone has paid to Festo as
changing the value of patent rights therefore seems to have been largely
wasted from a practical perspective.

The second finding is even more significant: the reason the Festo changes
had so little effect seems to be that the doctrine of equivalents was
already near death by the late 1990s. Even under the permissive doctrine of
equivalents rules in place before 2000, while everyone was focused on the
doctrine of equivalents, equivalents claims usually failed, most often on
summary judgment. That became even more true after 2000, and the Supreme
Court's 2002 decision didn't change the trend. In fact, district courts are
more likely to reject doctrine of equivalents claims today than ever
before.

This left us with a bit of a puzzle: what killed the doctrine of
equivalents in the 1990s? We suspected the answer was the growth of claim
construction Markman hearings after the Supreme Court's 1996 decision in
that case. Once courts were construing claims as a matter of law pre-trial,
and finding themselves in a position to resolve virtually all infringement
issues on summary judgment, they were naturally inclined to decide the
doctrine of equivalents issues too. And a court that has just rejected a
literal infringement argument - the only courts likely to spend much time
thinking about equivalents issues pre-trial - is unlikely to undo the work
of claim construction by sending the issue of infringement by equivalents
to the jury. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a fourth dataset,
including cases decided in the 1993 to 1995 timeframe. That data bears out
our hypothesis. The doctrine of equivalents was alive and well before
Markman, but has been in decline ever since.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:47.641486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:06:36.198000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/citation/,pkh62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ya4ek/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/relationships/node/,ya4ek,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde22d6c613b01ebd93606/,57bde22d6c613b01ebd93606,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pkh62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pkh62

name and likeness for commercial purposes. For years, courts have struggled
to make sense of two dimensions of this right - what it means to use a name
or likeness commercially, and what aspect of a person's likeness are
protected against appropriation. In the absence of any clear theoretical
foundation for the right of publicity, the meanings of these terms have
steadily swelled, to the point at which virtually any use that brings
financial benefit to someone by referencing an individual qualifies as a
violation of the right of publicity. At the same time, the courts have
developed no meaningful counterweight to this ever-expanding right.
Instead, they have created a few ad hoc exceptions in cases where the
sweeping logic of the right of publicity seems to lead to results they
consider unfair.

Two types of publicity claims have raised particular problems for the
courts. The first involves merchandising claims, in which individuals claim
violation of their publicity right not by the use of a name in advertising,
but by people who sell products that bear their name or likeness. Courts
have generally resolved these claims by making a distinction between news
or art, on the one hand, and merchandise, on the other - but as art and
information become increasingly commodified, this distinction - if it ever
made sense - has become ever harder to sustain. The second type of
problematic claim involves cases in which a use draws attention away from
the celebrity, or arguably sullies the celebrity's reputation in some way
that harms the overall value of her identity. Properly limited, such a
cause of action might have some theoretical appeal, but courts have applied
it in ways that exceed any plausible theoretical justification,
particularly when First Amendment considerations enter the fray.

Perhaps ironically, one root of the problems with these cases lies in the
very elusiveness of a theoretical justification for the right of publicity.
When the government can clearly identify a purpose in limiting speech,
courts have some basis on which to evaluate whether the speech limitation
lives up to that purpose. But because the right of publicity rests upon a
slough of sometimes sloppy rationalizations, courts have little way of
determining whether a particular speech limitation is necessary or even
appropriate in order to serve the law's normative goals. Instead, they
appear to assume that the sum of a set of inadequate justifications equals
far more than its parts, and allow right of publicity claims to run
roughshod over the speech interests of the public.

If the absence of a rationale has created the problem, then the answer lies
in identifying whether and when a right of publicity might serve a
legitimate government interest. Yet a review of the cases and literature
reveals that no one seems to be able to explain exactly why individuals
should have this right. A right of privacy can't justify it, for the right
of publicity has been applied in a wide range of situations that don't
implicate privacy at all. Some commentators have proposed a natural or
moral right of control over one's name or likeness, but there seems no
policy justification for giving such control, and the absence of such a
right in most of the world and indeed throughout most of U.S. history
should make us skeptical of claims based on some consensus moral belief.
The moral claim to own uses of one's name also seems inconsistent with the
absence of natural or moral rights justifications for other forms of
intellectual property.

Of late, and particularly in the merchandising and dilution-like cases,
courts and commentators have turned to the incentive-based rationale
underlying copyright law in search of both a justification for and
limitations on the right of publicity. Reasoning that the right of
publicity gives individuals the incentive to develop valuable personas,
courts reason that depriving them of the fruits of their labors will
interfere with those economic incentives. Some courts have even gone so far
as to create a fair use doctrine, importing from copyright law judicially
created limits on the enforcement of the right. This approach turns the
right of publicity into a new form of intellectual property, one based
explicitly on analogies to and justifications for real property.

We think copyright is the wrong analogy. In the United States, copyright
law is utilitarian. We grant copyrights in order to encourage the creation
of new works of authorship. There is no similar justification for the right
of publicity. Society doesn't need to encourage more celebrities, or more
marketing of celebrity image. Nor is there any evidence that, even if such
a result was desirable, a property-like right of publicity is well tailored
to that goal. Copyright's fair use doctrine, moreover, involves tradeoffs
between the interests of original creators and those who would like to make
transformative uses of their creative works; the right of publicity has no
similar tradeoff. Further, copyright's fair use doctrine is confusing to
the point of incoherence; it is hardly a model anyone would wish to
emulate. Finally, the analogy to copyright serves to obscure the important
free speech interests at stake in right of publicity cases. For better or
worse, copyright laws have gotten a free ride when it comes to the First
Amendment; the copyright analogy may prompt courts to mistakenly extend
that free ride to the right of publicity.

The Lanham Act is a far more appropriate analogy to the right of publicity.
The Lanham Act in its traditional form protects trademark owners against
commercial uses of a trademark by others that are likely to confuse
consumers, either as to the source of goods or as to the affiliation,
endorsement, or sponsorship of those goods by the trademark owner. The
right of publicity is designed at least in part to do the same thing for
celebrities. It prevents companies from using the name or likeness of an
individual in advertising or promotion to falsely suggest that the
individual has endorsed the advertised product. More recently, the Lanham
Act has been expanded to prevent dilution of famous trademarks by
commercial uses that draw attention away from the trademark owner, or throw
it into disrepute, even if they do not confuse. Dilution, too, has
analogies in the right of publicity. Uses of a celebrity's name or likeness
might in rare circumstances divert attention away from the celebrity or,
more likely, might tarnish the reputation of the celebrity by using her
name or likeness in a disreputable connection, even in the absence of
confusion or assumptions of endorsement. Finally, a few courts have
expanded trademark law to include a general right to control the
merchandising of goods bearing a trademark, even in the absence of
confusion or dilution. This merchandising right too has analogues in the
right of publicity. Indeed, the mutation of the right of publicity into a
virtually unlimited property right over any use of a name or likeness can
best be understood as the wholesale adoption of the putative trademark
merchandising right.

Reconceiving the right of publicity as an outgrowth of trademark law has
several significant benefits. First, it offers a helpful way to think about
the different sorts of claims made under the rubric of publicity. We have
considerable experience with each of these types of claims in trademark
law, and applying that knowledge can help us understand why we might (or
might not) want to prohibit particular uses, and when the law should forbid
them. Most importantly, looking at the right of publicity through the lens
of trademark law offers logical ways to limit the right of publicity.
Trademarks are not property rights in the traditional sense, though a few
commentators have argued that trademark owners should have property-like
rights over their marks. The idea of a merchandising right, while
recognized in a few cases and supported by trademark owners, is not
commonly used to decide trademark cases. It is also a problematic concept,
one that hardly deserves emulation. Trademark cases tend instead to be
decided either based on likelihood of confusion or on dilution grounds.
Both trademark infringement and dilution incorporate significant limiting
principles designed to balance the interests of society against the
interests of policy owners, and to accommodate First Amendment concerns.
These limits have not been incorporated into the right of publicity,
however. The result is a mutant version of trademark policy, including the
affirmative rights but virtually none of the defenses or limits of
trademark law.

A proper understanding of the right of publicity would draw more completely
on trademark principles, limiting the right to circumstances in which the
use of an individual's name or likeness is either likely to confuse
consumers or is likely to dilute the significance of a famous name.
Revising the right of publicity to conform to the rules we have worked out
in trademark cases will avoid some of the worst abuses of the right, limit
the conflict between the right of publicity and First Amendment principles,
and put the right on a more solid conceptual grounding.

In Part I, we describe the growth of the right of publicity from its narrow
privacy origins to a virtually unlimited, descendible, assignable property
right. Part I discusses two particular excesses that this trend has brought
about, and that are increasingly creating problems for the courts and the
public: the expanding merchandising right, and the dilution-like cause of
action. Part II discusses the existing efforts to explain the growth of the
right of publicity. Those explanations have generally focused on
incentive-based rationales akin to copyright law - rationales whose logic
breaks down in the right of publicity context. Part II goes on to explain
why copyright proves inadequate to justify or to delimit the right of
publicity, with particular reference to the merchandising and dilution-like
cases. In Part III, we offer a new explanation for the right of publicity,
one based in trademark principles. Part III shows how the right of
publicity has adopted some but not all of the rules of trademark law, and
how a more complete importation of trademark principles into publicity law
would solve many of the problems that plague the doctrine. Finally, in Part
IV we consider some objections and compare our approach to alternative
approaches for dealing with the problems of the publicity right.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:04.694337,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:04:17.242000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/citation/,r8pvh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6zezg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/relationships/node/,6zezg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde1a26c613b01edd95334/,57bde1a26c613b01edd95334,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r8pvh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r8pvh

debate over property rules in the technology law context. In particular, it
argues that the classic justification for legal entitlements protected by a
property rule - i.e., a right to injunctive relief - depends on the ability
to define and enforce property rights effectively. In the case of many
technology markets, the inability to tailor injunctive relief so that it
protects only the underlying right rather than also enjoining noninfringing
conduct provides a powerful basis for using a liability rule (i.e.,
awarding the relevant damages to the plaintiff) instead of a property rule.
Notably, where injunctive relief cannot be confined to protecting the
underlying right, the availability of such relief can give rise to a
""holdup strategy,"" whereby a firm threatens or uses litigation to obtain a
settlement significantly in excess of any harm it suffers. Such strategies,
as the Article explains, arise in a variety of technology law contexts,
including patent law, digital copyright cases, and spectrum regulation.
Depending on the particulars of the context, either courts or agencies
should superintend the relevant liability regime and, in some cases, the
administrative challenges may undermine the case for a liability rule at
all. Unfortunately, legal scholars have generally focused on the
substantive debate as to the proper scope of property rights - often
arguing for an all or nothing solution - at the expense of evaluating the
institutional considerations as to whether and when courts or agencies can
superintend a liability regime in lieu of a property right.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:45.076513,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:57:41.309000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/citation/,vgf7p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ghna7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/relationships/node/,ghna7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde0169ad5a1020668d76e/,57bde0169ad5a1020668d76e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vgf7p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vgf7p

doctrine is copyright misuse, which has been applied against restrictive
licensing provisions. The second set of doctrines provides that a number of
licensing rules are decided as questions of federal, not state, law. The

internalize the external costs and benefits one party's action confers on
another. They have thought this internalization desirable, reasoning that
if a party didn't capture the full social value of her actions she wouldn't
have optimal incentives to engage in those actions. Measured by this
standard, IP rights are inefficiently weak. There is abundant evidence that
the social value of innovations far exceeds the private value. But there is
also good evidence that, contrary to what economists might assume, these
spillovers actually encourage greater innovation. The result is a puzzle
for Demsetzians.

In this article, we offer three insights that help to explain the positive
role of innovation spillovers. First, we note that in IP, unlike real
property, a wide range of externalities matter, because IP rights are much
less certain than property rights, and because the decision to create a
legal entitlement will determine whether or not a transaction must occur.
Second, we make the point that while society needs some ex ante incentive
to innovate, it doesn't need (and doesn't particularly want) full
internalization of the benefits of an invention. Third, we observe that
even where internalizing externalities is desirable, property rights do not
in fact do so perfectly, and they create problematic distortions in
circumstances in which the buyer in a transaction makes productive reuse of
the work. The result of combining these insights is that at least where
innovation is concerned, we cannot rely on the easy equation of property
rights with efficient internalization of externalities.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:04.452008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:52:12.439000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/citation/,ytzev,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m5erb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/relationships/node/,m5erb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bddecdb83f6901f7656547/,57bddecdb83f6901f7656547,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytzev/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ytzev

equities before permanently enjoining a defendant. This is a good thing.
Since eBay, the tactic of threatening injunctions to, in the Court’s words,
“extract exorbitant fees” has declined. It's now harder for a patent
assertion entity (PAE), or patent “troll,"" and in certain cases, operating
companies, to win an injunction. But eBay’s discretionary test doesn’t
apply at the ITC. This has had the unintended consequence of driving those
who seek to circumvent eBay's ruling to the ITC, where the odds of getting
an injunctions are better. In this paper, we document that trend, which is
dramatic. Increasingly, cases filed at the ITC are filed by PAEs against an
entire industry, often information technology. Practicing entities too have
turned to the ITC to seek injunctions district courts won't give them, for
example on patents covering industry standards.

Because the ITC can’t award damages, it has granted injunctions as a matter
of course. But as we suggest in this paper, the Commission has more power
to adjust the remedy it grants than previously recognized. We think it
should use that flexibility to limit exclusion orders when competitive
conditions demand it. A PAE may not be any more justified to receive an
exclusion order from the ITC under its public interest analysis than to
receive an injunction from a district court applying eBay. Even practicing
entities should be denied the power to exclude in some circumstances, for
example when the patents are standards-essential and/or encumbered by a
RAND license, there is no evidence of bad faith, and the patentee can seek
damages in the district court. When exclusion orders are issued, delays in
their implementation and grandfathering in existing products can reduce
holdup. Bond and penalty provisions could be used to ensure that patentees
are compensated for ongoing infringement during these transition periods.
Using its discretion wisely, the ITC can administer the statute to fairly
and efficiently give patentees their due while minimizing harm to the
public interest.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:27.919093,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:50:53.950000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/citation/,6bvua,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8jxha/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/relationships/node/,8jxha,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bdde80594d9001ffd0e173/,57bdde80594d9001ffd0e173,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6bvua/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6bvua/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6bvua
