There is concern in the media and among public health professionals about the proliferation of advertisements for gambling and other risky products during sporting broadcasts and its potential impact on vulnerable groups including children and young people.

Methods: 

An established coding framework was used to identify and categorize all instances of risky product marketing in six broadcasts of English Premier League football: three episodes of Match of the Day, a highlights program on the BBC (a public service broadcaster), and three full matches on Sky Television (a commercial subscription channel).

Results: 

Gambling advertising occurred more frequently than either alcohol or hyperpalatable food advertising in both sporting highlights broadcasts on non-commercial UK television and full sports broadcasts on commercial stations. Overall, there was more advertising of risky products during highlights shows on the BBC than there was during live matches on Sky.

Conclusions: 

Concern about the advertising of gambling, alcohol and hyperpalatable food has focused on commercial stations which include advertisement breaks in their broadcasts. However, this research suggests that public broadcasts of football highlights, which do not include advertisement breaks, are also saturated with gambling and other risky product advertising. Further research is needed to investigate how advertising impacts different groups, particularly children and young people.",TRUE,FALSE,advertising|alcohol|english premier league|epl|food|football|gambling|soccer,2018-07-02T11:06:45.482818,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-10T15:13:32.562676,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/citation/,f6bu8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9rcmw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/relationships/node/,9rcmw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598c7703594d9002391ceb0a/,598c7703594d9002391ceb0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6bu8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6bu8,NA

Following at least 20 years of research, the book proposes a simple and powerful argument: inequality per se, more specifically income inequality, is harmful to every aspect of social life. In order to confirm this idea, the authors present a series of bivariate, cross-sectional associations showing comparisons across countries and within the United States. Despite the methodological limitations of this approach, the authors advance causal claims concerning the detrimental effects of income inequality. They also rule out poverty as a plausible alternative explanation, without directly measuring it. Meanwhile, over the last decade stratification scholars have demonstrated the nonlinear effect of economic factors, especially income, on health. The results suggest that a relative approach is best for analyzing dynamics at the top of the income distribution, whereas an absolute approach seems most appropriate for studying the bottom of the distribution. Consistent with this perspective, here I reanalyze data from The Spirit Level, adding a measure of poverty, in order to control the effect of inequality and explore its interaction with poverty. The findings show that inequality and poverty—which I contend are two interdependent but nonetheless distinct phenomena—interact across countries, such that the detrimental effects of inequality are present or stronger in countries with high poverty, and absent or weaker in countries with low poverty; poverty replaces inequality as the favored explanation of health and social ills across states. The new evidence suggests that income distributions are characterized by a complex interplay between inequality and poverty, whose interaction deserves further analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Income inequality|Interaction|Life expectancy|Poverty|Social problems,2018-07-02T11:06:45.374649,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-10T14:24:28.715695,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/citation/,mre7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u5zk7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/relationships/node/,u5zk7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598c6c066c613b0242c2721d/,598c6c066c613b0242c2721d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mre7c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mre7c,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.02.026

The author witnessed a homeless man dislocate his knee while playing softball. Rather than receiving humane medical attention the homeless man was subjected to hospital treatment that would be better described as medieval torture. The more money that the USA spends on healthcare the more inhumane US healthcare becomes. Although many people believe that money is the key to happiness, in this paper I will argue that the USA’s “profits over people” medical philosophy tends to inspire dreadful forms of inhumanity in the delivery of healthcare.

The Founding Fathers were all white men who treated people of color as subhumans. Donald Trump’s antipathy for Latinos and people of color is identical to the anti-democratic prejudices that the Founding Fathers institutionalized at the founding of the USA. In those bad old days, white supremacy reigned supreme and white racists were the unchallenged heroes of their own histories. Donald Trump and his fans want to “make America great again” by dehumanizing people of color and reinstituting the warped beliefs that transformed villainous white supremacists into Champions of Democracy.

A parallel literature on democratization poses mass mobilization as exogenous to political liberalization. Contributing to both literatures, we propose the category of unarmed collective violence to capture an empirically recurring form of unruly collective action, and use a mixed methods research design to examine its impact on democratization. An event history analysis finds that riots are positively associated with political liberalization in 103 nondemocracies from 1990 to 2004. Attacks by civilians on police stations during the 25th January Egyptian Revolution, which disrupted the coercive capacity of the Mubarak regime, illustrate one way in which unarmed collective violence can bring about a democratic breakthrough. A qualitative examination of all 80 democratic transitions held between 1980 and 2010 also reveals the salience of unarmed collective violence. These findings contribute to research on the dynamics of contentious democratization, and suggest that remaining unarmed may be more consequential for a democracy campaign than adhering to nonviolence.",TRUE,FALSE,authoritarian regimes|democratization|mobilization|nonviolence|protest|regime change|social movements|tactics|violence,2018-07-02T11:06:44.936387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-09T19:50:27.430175,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/citation/,tdcae,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96b8g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/relationships/node/,96b8g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598b66ab594d9002371c4630/,598b66ab594d9002371c4630,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tdcae/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tdcae/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tdcae,NA

Why, what is wrong if you swear your allegiance with a party, you may ask? Stereotyping is the major issue with this approach. If you identify yourself with a particular party (or worse, you become an official member of a party), you subconsciously consider all the other members of that party as your friends, and invariably you will have an emotional attachment to them.

In this contribution, we set out to interrogate that terminology, ultimately providing (we hope) a definitive breakdown of the meanings and implications of the idea of ‘greyness’ as it applies to this particular illicit market. As we shall see, the term ‘grey market’ has been rather liberally applied by researchers working on illicit markets in cultural objects, and is in danger of becoming a generic but unrefined synonym for the interface between certain illicit practices in excavation and the public antiquities trade. It would seem helpful therefore at this point in the development of the research evidence base on illicit antiquities – and particularly in the context of the theme and other contributions in this book – to pause and reflect on what we mean when we observe greyness in this market.",TRUE,FALSE,antiquities|antiquities trafficking|criminal markets|cultural property|grey markets|illicit antiquities|markets|organized crime|trafficking|transnational crime,2018-07-02T11:05:29.237000,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-09T12:10:29.932819,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/citation/,gdw4k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jfqnx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/relationships/node/,jfqnx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598afad06c613b0244c1ec67/,598afad06c613b0244c1ec67,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gdw4k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gdw4k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gdw4k,NA
