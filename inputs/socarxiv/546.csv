It further articulates, in complement, a novel theoretical and methodological conceptualisation for a hermeneutic psychological science. Methodology-wise, it puts into question a traditional more or less categorical and mechanical approach to the social and behavioural sciences as it strives to introduce a creative and insightful approach for the articulation of ideas. It rather seeks to construe the scientific method as being more about falsifiability and validation but driven by a sense of creative understanding and insight of notions laid out as open-ended conceptualisations. Theory-wise, it sees continuity between anthropology and psychology as anthropopsychology behind an entropic construct of human psychology based on a recurrent re-institutionalisation mechanism for intemporal-preservation-entropy-or-contiguity–or–ontological-preservation.",TRUE,FALSE,hermeneutic|meaning|ontology|psychopathy|theory,2018-09-11T01:56:41.837285,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T01:56:33.879874,NA,NA,not_applicable,Herein abstracted- within-and-beyond the 'forwardfacing purview of presencing public information-and-data implicited absolution' of the possibility of prospective knowledge!,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/citation/,x3b5y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b967b6ea58a18001a7c64f5/,5b967b6ea58a18001a7c64f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x3b5y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x3b5y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x3b5y,NA

Employing the concept of social dilemmas, this commentary describes analytically why scientists ¬in academia’s current incentive system work against their self-interest if they prioritize research credibility. Empirically, this article conducts a comprehensive review of meta-scientific research with a focus on quantitative political science, demonstrating that threats to the credibility of political science findings are systematic and real. Building on a framework to assess the credibility of scientific literatures, the review shows that a large fraction of the published literature makes itself inaccessible to intersubjective credibility assessments, fails tests of analytical robustness, or shows patterns of systematic deviation from true population estimates. Yet, the review also highlights the notable progress the discipline has made in recent years to secure research credibility. This commentary urges further steps toward the direction of research openness credibility. Specifically, it proposes specific institutional measures to better align individual researcher rationality with the collective good of verifiable, robust, and valid scientific results, such as dedicated verification procedures and the implementation of pre-registration and result-blind peer reviewing.",TRUE,FALSE,credibility|DA-RT|meta-science|open science|open social science|popper|publication bias|replicability|replication|reproducibility|robustness|transparency,2018-09-11T01:58:42.053801,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-11T01:58:22.956132,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/citation/,dq87w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e85s4/,e85s4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b962fa7a58a18001d7a40c7/,5b962fa7a58a18001d7a40c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dq87w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dq87w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dq87w,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11615-018-0131-7

These species are based on four main styles of music: latin, urban, rock and pop; the indicators assign weights to the genres based on the sociological subjective perspective of music fans from one category in relation to other music styles, i.e., how they view other types of music they don't feel affinity with.

This division of Sociology into different subfields is to a large extent related to methodology and choices between qualitative or quantitative research methods. Relying on theoretical constructs of the academic prestige economy, boundary demarcation, and taste for research, we examine the methodological divide in generalist Sociology journals. Using automated text analysis for 8,737 abstracts of papers published between 1995 and 2017, we discover evidence of this divide, but also of an entanglement between methodological choices and different research topics. Moreover, our results suggest a marginally increasing time trend for the publication of quantitative research in generalist journals. We discuss how this consolidation of methodological practices could enforce the entrenchment of different schools of thought, which ultimately reduces the potential for innovative and effective sociological research.",TRUE,FALSE,research methodology|scientometrics|sociology of science|symbolic boundaries,2018-09-09T17:44:01.631987,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-09T17:43:37.776703,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/citation/,s59bp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/234wu/,234wu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b95320ca58a18001a7b10ba/,5b95320ca58a18001a7b10ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s59bp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s59bp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s59bp,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038519853146

Experimental evidence from Germany,"Although observational studies from many countries have consistently shown that motherhood negatively affects women’s wages, experimental findings on its effect on the likelihood of being hired are less conclusive. Motherhood penalties in hiring have been reported in the US, the prototypical liberal market economy, but not in Sweden, the prototypical social-democratic welfare state. Based on a field experiment in Germany, this study examines the effects of parenthood on hiring processes in the prototypical conservative welfare state. My findings indicate that job recruitment processes indeed penalize women but not men for having children.

Therefore, parents' education may imbue children with high expectations but not always the means to fulfill them. Swedish data on children of immigrants from over 100 countries of origin support this view: net of parents' absolute years of schooling, a high rank in the sending country benefits children's aspirations, attitudes, and educational choices, but not their test scores or school grades.

According to media and informant reports, untold thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslims have been and are being detained in clandestine political re-education facilities, with major implications for society, local economies and ethnic relations. Considering that the Chinese state is currently denying the very existence of these facilities, this paper investigates publicly available evidence from official sources, including government websites, media reports and other Chinese internet sources. First, it briefly charts the history and present context of political re-education. Second, it looks at the recent evolution of re-education in Xinjiang in the context of ‘de-extremification’ work.

I argue that what can help dictators maintain elite cohesion is concentrating patronage within institutions capable of controlling access to a broad array of rents. I make this claim based on an original online survey of 2,496 firm managers and employees in Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia in which I randomized the type of offers made by political parties to companies for support in a hypothetical election. I show that Egyptian businesses, who have suffered the most under the authoritarian regime, counter-intuitively are also the most supportive of the country's rulers compared to businesspeople in other Arab countries. The underlying mechanism that best explains these findings is the Egyptian military's dominance in the control of patronage relative to the greater institutional diversity found in other countries.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-07T09:35:24.992573,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-07T09:34:38.268935,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/citation/,mrfcu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xbyh9/,xbyh9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b91ccba2c77f700177c90ef/,5b91ccba2c77f700177c90ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrfcu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrfcu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrfcu,NA
