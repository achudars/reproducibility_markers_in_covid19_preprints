Less is known, however, about its pivotal role for right-wing social movements which rely on personalized messages to mobilize supporters and challenge the mainstream party system. This paper analyzes online political communication by the right-wing populist movement Pegida and German political parties. We investigate to which extent parties attract supporters of Pegida, to which extent they address topics similar to Pegida and whether their topic use has become more similar over a period of almost two years. The empirical analysis is based on Facebook posts by main accounts and individual representatives of these political groups. We first show that there are considerable overlaps in the audiences of Pegida and the new challenger in the party system, AfD. Then we use topic models to characterize topic use by party and surveyed crowdworkers to which extent they perceive the identified topics as populist communication. The results show that while Pegida and AfD talk about rather unique topics and smaller parties engage to varying degrees with the topics populists emphasize, the two governing parties CDU and SPD clearly deemphasize those. Overall, the findings indicate that the considerable attention devoted to populist actors and shifts in public opinion due to the refugee crisis have left only moderate marks in political communication within the mainstream party system.",TRUE,FALSE,Facebook|Party politics|Political communication|Populism|Protest movements|Topic models,2018-07-02T11:41:25.485064,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-26T01:31:27.768806,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/citation/,96umt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qyhds/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/relationships/node/,qyhds,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a93093291b689000fa13f7b/,5a93093291b689000fa13f7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/96umt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/96umt/,https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328519,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/96umt

Yet, in an era of enrollment competition in higher education, Christian colleges must navigate their traditional mission to preserve and advance the faith, changing cultural attitudes regarding LBGTQ people, and the financial realities facing contemporary institutions. This paper draws from interviews with men who attended Christian colleges. First, we present their narratives to render the presence of LGBTQ people visible in these sites. Secondly, we seek to understand how these men made sense of their sexualities within educational cultures saturated with retention imperatives, institutional surveillance, and denominational ambivalence or hostility about LGBTQ persons. The men’s narratives highlight the challenges they faced as “unfit subjects” (Pillow, 2004), their absorption of normative constructions of gender and sexuality governing their educational context, and the need for Christian colleges to better serve their gay students of faith.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:41:25.455288,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-25T23:56:04.381333,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",Educational Studies,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/citation/,k65pz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mzjnt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/relationships/node/,mzjnt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9301f891b689000ca29143/,5a9301f891b689000ca29143,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k65pz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k65pz/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00131946.2018.1453513,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k65pz

The conditional theory of structural causa- tion and the rational choice conception of agency that have complemented each other in current scholarship have left missing links between elite conflict and mass mobilization. Examining the dialogic struggle among various actors involved in the process helps to overcome the teleological explanation of the rise of the Cultural Rev- olution and brings to light the politics of interpretation in constructing its meaning. The perspective shows ideological contradictions in the status quo ante to be important sources for change in an uncertain and destabilizing situation. The event thus did not result from the realization of actors’ fixed goals but was an emergent process of the disarticulation of structural contradictions, in which actors’ active appropriation and changing deployment of cultural repertoires were critical.",TRUE,FALSE,China|Communism|Cultural Revolution|Leftist Politics|Movements|Revolution|Socialism,2018-07-02T11:41:24.912302,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-26T01:29:28.807330,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/citation/,gwr43,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6qd7p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/relationships/node/,6qd7p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a91851d91b689000e9fbc06/,5a91851d91b689000e9fbc06,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwr43/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gwr43/,https://doi.org/10.1086/693922,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gwr43

OBJECTIVE To determine the degree of excess net passenger traffic in Puerto Rico for September and October 2017 based on historical patterns of variability in net passenger traffic. METHODS Data come from the Monthly Operational Report published by the Puerto Rico Port Authority for the 2010-2018 fiscal years. Data was aggregated by month and year, and means (expected net passenger traffic) and 95% confidence intervals (C.I. or patterns of variability) were produced for each month. Data from 2017-2018 Monthly Operational Report was used to compare the expected passenger flow with the totals for September and October 2017.  RESULTS The expected net passenger flow for September and October was -15.39 thousands (95% C.I. = -18.61 thousands and -12.16 thousands) and -0.88 thousands (95% C.I. = -5.01 thousands and 3.26 thousands), respectively. Net passenger flow for September and October 2017 was -34.6 and -88.3 thousand passengers. Excess net passengers for these two months was -19.2 and -87.42 thousand people in comparison to the expected net passenger flow, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Based on this comparison the net passenger flow for September and October 2017 and expected net passenger flow from Puerto Rico was -106.62 thousand passengers.

One reflection of this tolerance is the diminishing occurrence of White flight: in 2010, only one in one hundred neighborhoods is all-White. Although some have declared the ""end of segregation"" based on this news, I document how ``integrated'' neighborhoods are actually fragmented into many different types of racial change. This means that some nominally integrated neighborhoods have less in common with one another than they do with adjacent segregated neighborhoods. Others, however, appear to maintain stable integration across many decades.

This research evaluates the legacy of slavery on long-run development and its detailed mechanism which consists of two key factors, labor market institutions and human capital structure. Using county-level data of the U.S. South and exploiting exogenous variation in ecological conditions, I show that slavery has had persistent negative impact on economic development through the human capital structure. To explain the link between slavery and human capital, I find from complete count census data in 1940 that the legacy of slavery impeded integration of black workers into the competitive labor market which accordingly reduced the incentives of blacks to invest in human capital. In addition, evidence from the progressive Era along the border counties shows that the legacy of slavery on the labor market was operated through selective enforcement of labor market regulations. Lastly, I present the roles of racial wage discrimination and selective migration which reinforced persistence of the mechanism.",TRUE,FALSE,human capital|institutions|labor market|mechanism|persistence|slavery,2018-07-02T11:39:51.312946,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-23T11:05:54.874096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Yeonha Jung,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/citation/,snpg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8f42dada91d4000faedb85/,5a8f42dada91d4000faedb85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/snpg2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/snpg2

However, building upon literature which relates financialization to the mathematization of financial valuation practices, this chapter argues that the banking sector was itself financialized since the 1980s. Our historical overview of the changing nature of banking traces the thread running from the Black-Scholes options pricing formula through to Value-at-Risk modelling and Collateralized Debt Obligation valuation. We explore the calculative and regulatory consequences of these risk management techniques and how they allowed large volumes of risk to be removed off banks’ balance sheets and regulatory capital minimized, with deleterious results for financial stability.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:39:50.547722,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-22T22:38:47.722219,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Nathan Coombs|Arjen van der Heide,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/citation/,mptgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dz8sn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/relationships/node/,dz8sn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8e941d91b689000d9e345e/,5a8e941d91b689000d9e345e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mptgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mptgs/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mptgs
