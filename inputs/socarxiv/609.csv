Presence, Privacy, and Intimate Surveillance","The moment of birth was once the instant where parents and others first saw their child in the world, but with the advent of various imaging technologies, most notably the ultrasound, the first photos often precede birth (Lupton, 2013). In the past several decades, the question is no longer just when the first images are produced, but who should see them, via which, if any, communication platforms? Should sonograms (the ultrasound photos) be used to announce the impending arrival of a new person in the world? Moreover, while that question is ostensibly quite benign, it does usher in an era where parents and loved ones are, for the first years of life, the ones deciding what, if any, social media presence young people have before they’re in a position to start contributing to those decisions. This chapter addresses this comparatively new online terrain, postulating the provocative term intimate surveillance, which deliberately turns surveillance on its head, begging the question whether sharing affectionately, and with the best of intentions, can or should be understood as a form of surveillance. Firstly, this chapter will examine the idea of co-creating online identities, touching on some of the standard ways of thinking about identity online, and then starting to look at how these approaches do and do not explicitly address the creation of identity for others, especially parents creating online identities for their kids. I will then review some ideas about surveillance and counter-surveillance with a view to situating these creative parental acts in terms of the kids and others being created. Finally, this chapter will explore several examples of parental monitoring, capturing and sharing of data and media about their children, using various mobile apps, contextualising these activities not with a moral finger-waving, but by surfacing specific questions and literacies which parents may need to develop in order to use these tools mindfully, and ensure decisions made about their children’s’ online presences are purposeful decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|infancy online|infant wearables|intimate surveillance|social media|sonograms|surveillance|ultrasounds,2018-07-02T11:06:46.191297,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-11T06:34:10.462984,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/citation/,ay43e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fjh5e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/relationships/node/,fjh5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598d4f44b83f690253e1d9a1/,598d4f44b83f690253e1d9a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ay43e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ay43e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ay43e,NA

Specifically, I create new panel datasets that follow immigrants and their children across complete-count US censuses to understand the economic consequences of citizenship attainment.

There is concern in the media and among public health professionals about the proliferation of advertisements for gambling and other risky products during sporting broadcasts and its potential impact on vulnerable groups including children and young people.

Methods: 

An established coding framework was used to identify and categorize all instances of risky product marketing in six broadcasts of English Premier League football: three episodes of Match of the Day, a highlights program on the BBC (a public service broadcaster), and three full matches on Sky Television (a commercial subscription channel).

Results: 

Gambling advertising occurred more frequently than either alcohol or hyperpalatable food advertising in both sporting highlights broadcasts on non-commercial UK television and full sports broadcasts on commercial stations. Overall, there was more advertising of risky products during highlights shows on the BBC than there was during live matches on Sky.

Conclusions: 

Concern about the advertising of gambling, alcohol and hyperpalatable food has focused on commercial stations which include advertisement breaks in their broadcasts. However, this research suggests that public broadcasts of football highlights, which do not include advertisement breaks, are also saturated with gambling and other risky product advertising. Further research is needed to investigate how advertising impacts different groups, particularly children and young people.",TRUE,FALSE,advertising|alcohol|english premier league|epl|food|football|gambling|soccer,2018-07-02T11:06:45.482818,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-10T15:13:32.562676,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/citation/,f6bu8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9rcmw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/relationships/node/,9rcmw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598c7703594d9002391ceb0a/,598c7703594d9002391ceb0a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6bu8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6bu8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6bu8,NA

Following at least 20 years of research, the book proposes a simple and powerful argument: inequality per se, more specifically income inequality, is harmful to every aspect of social life. In order to confirm this idea, the authors present a series of bivariate, cross-sectional associations showing comparisons across countries and within the United States. Despite the methodological limitations of this approach, the authors advance causal claims concerning the detrimental effects of income inequality. They also rule out poverty as a plausible alternative explanation, without directly measuring it. Meanwhile, over the last decade stratification scholars have demonstrated the nonlinear effect of economic factors, especially income, on health. The results suggest that a relative approach is best for analyzing dynamics at the top of the income distribution, whereas an absolute approach seems most appropriate for studying the bottom of the distribution. Consistent with this perspective, here I reanalyze data from The Spirit Level, adding a measure of poverty, in order to control the effect of inequality and explore its interaction with poverty. The findings show that inequality and poverty—which I contend are two interdependent but nonetheless distinct phenomena—interact across countries, such that the detrimental effects of inequality are present or stronger in countries with high poverty, and absent or weaker in countries with low poverty; poverty replaces inequality as the favored explanation of health and social ills across states. The new evidence suggests that income distributions are characterized by a complex interplay between inequality and poverty, whose interaction deserves further analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Income inequality|Interaction|Life expectancy|Poverty|Social problems,2018-07-02T11:06:45.374649,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-10T14:24:28.715695,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/citation/,mre7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u5zk7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/relationships/node/,u5zk7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598c6c066c613b0242c2721d/,598c6c066c613b0242c2721d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mre7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mre7c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mre7c,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.02.026
