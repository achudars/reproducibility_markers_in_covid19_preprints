The main hypotheses of this paper is that a child who lives in a household that receives the benefit has higher chances of being in school, lower chances to have age-grade discrepancy, and lower chances of working. Data used are from the 2010 Brazilian Demographic Census. Logistical models were estimated for each dependent variable (school enrollment, age-grade discrepancy, and child labor) and for three household income thresholds. Independent variables account for characteristics related to the household, mother, child, and whether the household was receiving Bolsa Família. The income thresholds are a maximum household per capita income of 70 Brazilian Reais, 140 Brazilian Reais (the official maximum value for eligibility into the Bolsa Família in 2010), and 280 Brazilian Reais. Models were also estimated separated by the rural and urban areas in the official income threshold. Results follow initial hypotheses of higher chances of school enrollment and lower chances of age-grade discrepancy among children who receive Bolsa Família. However, models also suggest higher chances of child labor among beneficiaries of the program.",TRUE,FALSE,Age-grade discrepancy|Avaliação|Avaliação de políticas públicas|Bolsa Família|Bolsa Família Program|Brasil|Brazil|Child labor|Conditional cash transfer program|Desigualdade|Desigualdade social|Distorção|Distorção idade-série|Educação|Education|Erradicação|Evaluation|Evaluation of public policies|Inequality|PBF|PET|Políticas públicas|Programa de Erradicação do Trabalho Infantil|Public policies|Social|Social inequality|Trabalho infantil,2018-07-02T13:32:08.460111,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-28T10:32:25.107688,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/citation/,u8crb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3vw5k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/relationships/node/,3vw5k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abb1c660b58f80011c5c2f9/,5abb1c660b58f80011c5c2f9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8crb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u8crb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u8crb,NA

Notifications that alert users to the existence of gaps including incomplete or missing articles, in particular, are found to be ineffective at improving articles. Only through the process of trust-building and the development of negotiated boundary objects, potential allies (institutional academics in this case) can be enrolled in the task of editing the encyclopaedia.

First, self-reports of presidential votes in 2012 and 2016 from the American National Election Studies show that Obama-to-Trump voters and 2012 eligible nonvoters composed a substantial share of Trump’s 2016 voters and were disproportionately likely to be members of the white working class. Second, when county vote tallies in 2012 and 2016 are merged with the public-use microdata samples of the 2012-to-2016 American Community Surveys, areal variations across 1,142 geographic units that sensibly partition the United States show that Trump’s gains in 2016 above Romney’s performance in 2012 are strongly related to the proportion of the voting population in each area that was white and working class.

However, there is little, if any, evidence to support this position. Recent research has suggested the creative and cultural occupations are dominated by those from professional or managerial backgrounds (O’Brien et al 2016, Oakley et al 2017), with cultural theorists arguing this reflects declining rates of social mobility over time (Banks 2017). This paper provides the first empirical assessment of claims made by policy and cultural theory concerning changing patterns of social mobility into cultural and creative occupations. We use the England and Wales Longitudinal Study, along with three birth cohort studies, to offer the first analysis of social mobility into cultural and creative occupations over time. We demonstrate that: cultural and creative occupations have always been characterised by overrepresentations of those from privileged social origins, with little evidence of a classless meritocracy; rates of absolute social mobility are declining in these occupations, contradicting policymakers’ faith in a ‘meritocracy’ for talented individuals aiming to work in artistic and cultural jobs; this decline in absolute levels of social mobility is in contrast to the stability in relative social mobility, indicating there was no ‘golden age’ for social mobility into cultural occupations. These three points illustrate the importance of occupational perspectives on cultural and creative industries and the value of sociological analysis for public policy questions in this area. In particular, the lack of social fluidity in the occupations producing culture is a key issue for future public policy intervention. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research on longevity of cultural careers and the importance of gender using the Longitudinal Study dataset.",TRUE,FALSE,cohorts|cultural and creative industries|culture|ons longitudinal study|social inequality|social mobility,2018-07-02T13:32:07.096063,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-27T15:07:34.262269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Orian Brook|Dave O'Brien|Mark Taylor,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/citation/,7njy3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ujdgy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/relationships/node/,ujdgy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aba44c073108a000d7f1efc/,5aba44c073108a000d7f1efc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7njy3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7njy3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7njy3,NA

The teaching profession is filled with countless opportunities to enrich the academic lives of students. While some concepts and educational objectives will be easy for students to grasp, others will require creativity to ensure that important learning objectives are met. The teaching strategies used must therefore be in line with the contextual learning theory where the aim of education is the integration of content learnt with the real world experiences. Using audio/visual aids in teaching is one way to enhance lesson plans and give students additional ways to process subject information. Therefore, teaching tools such as interactive case studies, simulations and games, group work are widely recommended by several research organizations.
In the past, many activities of accounting professors were restricted or confined by their classroom walls. Today, numerous technological advancements in communication infrastructure, equipment and online tools greatly facilitate the initiatives that require effective teachings. Outside experts can now visit the classroom, students can explore or collaborate in distant places and professors can extend the geographical reach of their lessons simply via the means of digital video technology.
Presenting accountancy in student-centered and computer-based learning environments can demonstrate the practicality and necessity of the subject, particularly as a foundation for many career options.

This literature, however, has neglected an important measure of everyday religious practice, preference, and socialization: religious media consumption. We take a key social issue where attitudes have been shown to be largely shaped by religion—same-sex relationships—as an example to determine whether religious media consumption predicts social attitudes net of the measures typically included in the literature on religion and attitudes: affiliation, practice, and literalism. We draw on data from three national surveys, each of which contains different measures of religious media consumption and attitudes toward various same-sex relationships: the 1998 General Social Survey, 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, and 2012 Portraits of American Life Study. Both multivariate and propensity score matching analyses demonstrate that religious media consumption independently predicts lower support for same-sex relationships in all three surveys. We propose that religious media consumption is a key measure of religious practice, preference, and socialization that shapes Americans’ views toward social issues through both direct messages and by fortifying subcultural boundaries.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|media|propensity score matching|public opinion|religion|same-sex adoption|same-sex marriage|sexuality,2018-07-02T11:45:30.931289,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-27T02:27:49.490533,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|Arts and Humanities|Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/citation/,vr5df,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6qs4v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/relationships/node/,6qs4v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab967869f98940012c56142/,5ab967869f98940012c56142,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vr5df/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vr5df/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vr5df,https://doi.org/10.1177/2F2329496516686616

All past attempts to link the title of ""guest"" to dualistic churches in the West and East, or to the Catholic and Orthodox Church have failed and have no reliance on sources. It is certain that this is an original title inherent in Bosnian medieval spirituality, which probably would have to rely on early Christian practice of hospitality. This hypothesis was also suggested by some earlier researchers pointing to the equivalence of the term ""stranger"" and ""guest"" in the sources, also prominent in Old and New Testament abound with the many uses of these terms. Knowing that God in the Bible reveals Him through the incarnating Christ in a role of stranger or a guest in the homes of people, it is appropriate to assume that the concept of ""hospitality"", ""home"" (hiža) and ""hospitium"" (gostinjac) is of crucial importance within Bosnian Church's Christian mysticism. In accordance with the etymology of the title ""guests"" it is reasonable to assume that their ecclesial activity was closely related to the missionary activities of preaching and spreading the Word on one very high level which required the community to have a great respect for them. It is known that Christ identified with the guests, that the service to the guest was equalized with the service of Christ Himself, that the reward for hospitality to the guest was eternal life and that the inhospitality toward the guest meant the eternal punishment. The spiritual activity of the guests had to have an emphasis on the theology of affirmation so characteristic for Christian mysticism.
