The EU's policy and regulatory framework for bioeconomy and biofuels is seen as a multi-layered and complex issue. Policies around biofuels have developed recently in the EU.  Renewable Energy Directive II established a binding target for the use of renewable energy across the European Union by 2030 to be 32% of the total energy production. Finland is a country where the utilization of forest biomass has traditions ranging back centuries and continues in the present day with bioenergy holding a central role in the Finnish energy matrix. Our case study is focused on examining the public perceptions of biofuels in Finland and is linked to the discussion about climate change, global warming, and sustainable development. 
 
We used a stakeholder approach and mapped key stakeholders in the biofuel sector in Finland from six stakeholder categories: corporations, governmental actors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), municipalities, universities, and the media. We selected 59 online publications for our analysis from a time period between 2010-2019. Frame analysis was conducted using three pairs of polarised frames: environmental positive and negative, economic positive and negative, and technological positive and negative. 
 
The results show that for the most part the framing of biofuel discussion in Finland is positive and emphasizes the environmentally and economically positive aspects. The negative aspects that came to front are especially in the notions of economic costs and in arguments for environmental calculations. The EU legislation itself is seen as a background to all this discussion and is itself not scrutinized extensively by the various stakeholders.",TRUE,FALSE,biofuels|European union|frames|public perceptions|public policy,2020-02-04T19:05:22.171786,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-04T19:04:58.656387,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/citation/,5u6yp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jmd5e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/relationships/node/,jmd5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e392d84fa39b701bf1dba90/,5e392d84fa39b701bf1dba90,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5u6yp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5u6yp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5u6yp,NA

However, while finding and keeping a job are considered one of the key challenges inmates face as they move back into society, there is limited research on the dynamics and trajectories of post-prison employment. Little is also know about whether work characteristics and its relation to crime affect employment trajectories following release. Using data from the study ``Reintegration, desistance and recidivism among female inmates in Chile'' (RDFC), our paper describes trajectories of employment among a cohort of 225 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile and followed during the first year after release. We use sequence analysis to explore monthly patterns of employment considering different types of work (i.e., self-employed / employed, legitimate / under-the-table). To better account for the complex relationship between work and crime, we include offending as another type of income-generating activity. Finally, we use cluster analysis and regression models to explore which individual characteristics are associated with employment and offending trajectories.  Our results show a significant level of heterogeneity in employment trajectories by job type, and the importance of considering work and offending to obtain a more complete picture of the dynamics of employment during reentry.",TRUE,FALSE,Chile|female employment|offending|reentry|sequence analysis,2020-02-04T19:16:24.519786,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-04T19:16:10.810308,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/citation/,k5zyd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e391d7757427b01cb0c46ab/,5e391d7757427b01cb0c46ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k5zyd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k5zyd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k5zyd,NA

While a supportive and potentially rewarding role, informal care can become a time and emotionally demanding activity, which may hinder older adults’ quality of life. In a context of rising demand for informal carers, we investigated how caregiving states and transitions are linked to overall levels and changes in quality of life, and how the relationship varies according to care intensity and burden. We used fixed effects and change analyses to examine six-wave panel data (2008–2018) from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH, n=5076; ages 50–74). The CASP-19 scale is used to assess both positive and negative aspects of older adults’ quality of life. Caregiving was related with lower levels of quality of life in a graded manner, with those providing more weekly hours and reporting greater burden experiencing larger declines. Two-year transitions corresponding to starting, ceasing and continuing care provision were associated with lower levels of quality of life, compared to continuously not caregiving. Starting and ceasing caregiving were associated with negative and positive changes in quality of life score, respectively, suggesting that cessation of care leads to improvements despite persistent lower overall levels of quality of life.

We investigate a link between these by asking whether religion buffers against the negative effect of unemployment on happiness. Although theorized or implicitly assumed in many studies, empirical demonstrations of a causal, moderating effect of religion have been infrequent and often not strong methodologically. We conduct individual-level fixed effects models to test for the buffering effect in the U.S. context using recent panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (GSS). Religious service attendance, belief in life after death, and trying to carry one’s religious beliefs over into other dealings in life all substantially buffered the effect of unemployment on happiness. Praying daily, believing God exists, identifying as a religious person, and having a religious affiliation did not. We discuss these results in the context of prior work and existing theory. To further support a causal interpretation of these findings, we also conduct a secondary analysis showing that unemployment does not appear to increase or decrease religiousness.

This paper uses a Roman road built along a ridge in Cumbria, England as a case study. The ‘High Street’ Roman road provides a suitable case study as its route along the ridge is dictated by the topography. By comparing the computed Least Cost Path results when including and not including traversal across slope as a cost component, this research has found that the inclusion results in Least Cost Paths that more accurately model the known route of the Roman road along the ridge. The Least Cost Path model when not including traversal across slope resulted in 84.8% of the Least Cost Path being within 600m of the known route, compared to 100% when including traversal across slope. Due to the application of anisotropic cost functions, this research also identified that both Least Cost Path models predicted the route from the south towards the north frontiers more accurately, suggesting the Roman road was built with this direction of movement in mind.",TRUE,FALSE,GIS|least cost path|roads|Roman|spatial analysis|spatial statistics,2020-02-01T23:23:28.586869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T23:23:08.301981,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/citation/,q5yad,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e356a04fa39b700711e427a/,5e356a04fa39b700711e427a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q5yad/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q5yad/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q5yad,NA

Consecration and Dispositif in Transnational Academic Fields,"Rankings have grown in importance in the last decades. This is particularly evident in, but not limited to, academia. In this paper, we propose a power analytical take on academic rankings as a transnational(izing) phenomenon. In doing so, we make two contributions. First, we develop a conceptual definition of rankings as consecratory institutions. After providing an overview of the most prominent types of rankings in the academic field and discussing the different forms they can take, we suggest that rankings operate through subjectivation, zero-sum comparisons, quantification, publication and generating a doxical belief. Second, we propose that rankings fulfill a strategic double function. As a particularly momentous consecratory institution, rankings propel power shifts in the academic field and beyond by preferring (and being pushed by) specific academic milieus, types of agents, paradigms, and strategies. As a dispositif, rankings operate at the intersection of different fields, open academic fields up for a lay audience and advance processes of transnationalization by facilitating new modes of governance for hubs of state institutions, private corporations, media corporations, and data providers. Concluding, we argue that the consecration and dispositif functions rely on some basic principles of the practical functioning of rankings.",TRUE,FALSE,Academia|Consecration|Dispositif|Field theory|Rankings|Transnationalization,2020-02-01T23:22:07.443881,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T23:21:42.164543,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/citation/,qjkmb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e353e24fa39b7007d1e0931/,5e353e24fa39b7007d1e0931,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qjkmb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qjkmb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qjkmb,https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429274947

The study adopts a qualitative technique of semi-structured interviews to elicit the views of 12 purposively chosen participants. The process of a thematic analysis of the qualitative data led to the emergence of three overarching themes that aimed to answer the main research question which is how the dental students in the Saudi context perceive the ESP materials and the impact these materials have on their language proficiency. The key findings indicate that the ESP learners in the dentistry department have a very positive attitude towards learning the English language in general and ESP in particular. Their awareness of their linguistic needs makes it a significant study in the field of ESP in Saudi Arabia. The results also suggest that the coursebook contents and material are outdated and inappropriate for the ESP learners in the Saudi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. The findings illustrate that the ESP teachers need to use the English language in classrooms and introduce learner-centred interactive activities to encourage students to participate in classroom activities. In light of the findings, the study outlines the implications and gives directions for future research.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL context|English for specific purposes (ESP)|English proficiency|Saudi Arabia,2020-02-01T23:15:42.625829,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T23:15:14.869545,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/citation/,z8db4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e34fa5457427b00760c3288/,5e34fa5457427b00760c3288,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z8db4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z8db4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z8db4,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no4.1

The untransposed stereos in the digital archives,"Digitizing stereo photographs can bring back to museums and archives some of the challenges that early photographers had to deal with. When digitizing the original negative plates in wet collodion or in gelatin silver, the protocol followed for stereos is apparently the same as for mono photography. As a result, archives are presenting to their public and researchers files with untransposed left and right images of each stereo pair. In other words, wrong or ’pseudo views’ are being uploaded daily in institutional websites and databases, adding an extra layer of difficulty for the presentation and viewing of some historical gems of western visual culture.

Carlos Relvas's stereoscopic photography: the digital reunion of negatives and prints,"The beginning the photographic activity of Carlos Relvas (1838-1894) is closely connected to stereoscopic photography. This fact has not always been quite clear since Carlos Relvas’s stereoviews have remained one of the least known sides of his photographic work. The dispersion of his stereo cards among several public and private collections, as well as the long period of inaccessibility to his archive of negatives, hindered the perception of the meaningful work that Carlos Relvas carried out in the production of stereoscopic views of Portugal. One of the main challenges of the 21st-century studies of photography lies in the opportunity to publish online images from early photography collections. Digital media can enhance these collections and expand their reading. Among the main beneficiaries will be photographic negatives, which will gain new heuristic importance in this new environment of mediations. That was our intuition by developing a digital catalogue for the collections of Carlos Relvas’s stereoscopic photography aiming to bring together and combine all his negatives and positives and thus, for the first time, allow a comprehensive image of his passion for this type of photography.",TRUE,FALSE,Carlos Relvas|Catalogue Raisonné|Collodion-on-glass negative|Portuguese Nineteenth Century Photography|Stereoscopic Photography,2020-02-01T03:20:01.600140,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T03:19:30.652519,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76caa|Arts and Humanities|Photography,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/citation/,6qdj3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e34a66a57427b00620c301c/,5e34a66a57427b00620c301c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qdj3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qdj3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qdj3,NA
