Theoretical models suggest that complex cultural adaptations can arise from an optimal mix of (i) individual learning that is of sufficient accuracy plus (ii) social learning that is of sufficiently high fidelity and is payoff- biased. Here I review the findings of a series of experimental studies of human learning, designed to simulate the kind of technology-based tasks that our ancestors would have faced. Results of these studies support the predictions of the models, and show that contemporary humans’ learning strategies are broadly adaptive. Performance typically improved through effective individual learning and payoff-biased social learning. The latter crucially allowed participants to escape low-fitness locally optimal artifact designs and jump to higher-fitness designs, assuming a realistic multimodal adaptive landscape underlying artifact fitness. On the other hand, people also exhibited predictable flaws in their learning, such as the copying of neutral traits exhibited by successful models along with their functional traits (i.e. cultural hitchhiking), and an unwillingness to share information with others under certain circumstances.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|evolutionary archaeology|social learning,2018-09-18T02:46:42.287390,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-18T02:46:25.389036,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/citation/,gn7pa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nbkvy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/relationships/node/,nbkvy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9fbfeb689e1e00179d908d/,5b9fbfeb689e1e00179d908d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gn7pa/,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-54553-8_8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gn7pa

One of the earliest criticisms of E O Wilson’s sociobiology project was the focus on presumed genetically evolved behavioural universals, and lack of attention to cultural diversity and cultural (as opposed to genetic) history. As sociobiology split into different fields during the 1980s, each developed their own approaches and assumptions. Human behavioural ecologists employed the ‘phenotypic gambit’, assuming that culture is a proximate means by which natural selection generates currently-adaptive behavioural strategies. Evolutionary psychologists distinguished between transmitted and evoked culture, the former involving the social transmission of information, the latter involving the triggering of genetically-prespecified behaviours in response to different environmental cues (typically ancestral cues, such that behaviour may no longer be currently adaptive). Evoked culture has been the focus of most research in evolutionary psychology. Cognitive anthropologists have a similar notion of ‘cultural attraction’, where universal aspects of cognition evoke predictable responses due to individual learning. Finally, cultural evolution (or gene-culture coevolution) approaches stress the causal role of transmitted culture. Here, human cognition is assumed to be relatively domain-general and content-free, with genetic evolution having shaped social learning processes to allow the rapid spread of locally adaptive knowledge (although occasionally allowing the spread of maladaptive behaviour, due to the partial decoupling of genetic and cultural evolution). All the while, the traditional social sciences have remained steadfastly unwilling to accept that evolutionary approaches to human behaviour have any merit or relevance, and indeed have abandoned the scientific method in favour of more politically motivated interpretive methods. Most curiously, the social sciences have abandoned the concept of culture, as they define it. I will discuss all of these approaches in terms of (i) the extent to which they give causal weight to genetic inheritance, individual learning and social learning, and how these process interact; (ii) their assumptions about the domain-specificity of human cognition; (iii) ultimate-proximate causation; (iv) specific debates over language evolution, cooperation and the demographic transition; and (v) prospects for reconciliation and integration of these tensions across the evolutionary human sciences and the social sciences more broadly.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|culture|evolutionary psychology|human behavioural ecology|sociobiology,2018-09-18T02:44:21.666294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-18T02:44:07.307414,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Alex Mesoudi,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/citation/,epdfv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kjn38/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/relationships/node/,kjn38,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9faeec63caf90019c2e72f/,5b9faeec63caf90019c2e72f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/epdfv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/epdfv

A theoretical reassessment and empirical analysis of the value of motivation in the labor market","Inequality has often been explained by stable individual traits or by the structural features of labor markets. This study argues that we also should consider task involvement when we account for labor market inequality. Three mechanisms derived from experimental research link task involvement to performance: individuals involved in tasks are more focused on the work process, are more dedicated to mastery and problem-solving, and have stronger product quality perseverance. Despite the significance of task involvement as a motivation, its potential implication for labor market inequality is so far rather unacknowledged. We aim to develop its theoretical implications in the labor market context and test the expectation that task involvement is related to wage attainment by analyzing representative data for Sweden (LNU) and Europe (ESS).

Neighborhood Boundaries and the Spatial Dynamics of Violent Crime,"Neighborhood boundaries are a defining aspect of highly segregated urban areas. Yet, few studies examine the particular challenges and spatial processes that occur at the bordering region between two neighborhoods. Extending the growing literature on spatial interdependence, this article argues that neighborhood boundaries—defined as sharp changes in the racial or socioeconomic composition of neighborhoods—are a salient feature of the spatial structure with implications for violent crime and other outcomes. Boundaries lack the social control and cohesion of adjacent homogeneous areas, are contested between groups provoking intergroup conflict, and create opportunities for criminal behavior. This article presents evidence linking racial neighborhood boundaries to increased violent crime.

A cyberbalkanized network was constructed using data shared on Facebook Pages during the 2014 Hong Kong protests. Our findings indicate “mutual ignoring” was a prominent triad network configuration, whereas no such configuration was found in randomly generated networks.

Age-specific divorce rates show that the trend is driven by younger women, which is consistent with longer term trends showing uniquely high divorce rates among people born in the Baby Boom period. Finally, I analyze the characteristics of newly married women and estimate the trend in their likelihood of divorcing based on the divorce models. The results show falling divorce risks for more recent marriages. The accumulated evidence thus points toward continued decline in divorce rates. The United States is progressing toward a system in which marriage is rarer and more stable than it was in the past.",TRUE,FALSE,american community survey|demography|divorce|family demography|marriage|#paa2019,2018-09-16T01:47:22.620656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T23:11:09.006015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/citation/,h2sk6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yb4hr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/relationships/node/,yb4hr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9c3b5db7f1410018c458ba/,5b9c3b5db7f1410018c458ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h2sk6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h2sk6/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023119873497,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h2sk6

I argue that private rental market subsides have played an increasing role in the provision of social housing in Ireland. Instead of policies that facilitate the construction of affordable housing or the direct construction of social housing, current housing policies have addressed the social housing crisis by encouraging and relying excessively on the private market to deliver housing. The housing crisis has challenged governments to increase the social housing supply, but the implementation of a larger plan to deliver social housing has not been effective, as is evidenced by the rapid decline of both private and social housing supply and the increasing number of homeless people in Dublin.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-14T11:49:45.402718,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T11:48:41.917128,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/citation/,ev35x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9b97b8bab52700170d4595/,5b9b97b8bab52700170d4595,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ev35x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ev35x/,https://doi.org/10.13060/23362839.2018.5.1.402,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ev35x

It draws on case study research, and I examine areas which impact on the way social housing has been implemented since 2003 to study the concentration of decision power the private construction sector has on social housing policymaking, which sets the tone of government intervention on social housing. I argue this was part of the Workers’ Party’s approach to neoliberal policies in a more moderated style, a type of intervention repeated on numerous occasions under previous administrations. This article concludes by noting the prominent role of the private sector in social housing developments.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-09-14T11:49:25.932937,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-14T11:48:23.555962,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",Valesca Lima,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/citation/,kgzr5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9b9683bab52700190d20f3/,5b9b9683bab52700190d20f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kgzr5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kgzr5/,https://doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2017.1408406,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kgzr5
