Not surprisingly, Muslims – a religiously and socio-culturally diverse faith-based populace – are not an exception. To address this complex area of criminal justice and social policy, some scholars advocate implementing restorative justice (RJ) approaches. While RJ approaches have been traditionally used in Islamic cultures for conflict resolutions, to date, few studies have investigated how RJ operates in dealing with IPV in Muslim countries and communities. This article explores how RJ approaches towards IPV operate in some Muslim countries/communities, and offers insights into developing culturally and religiously appropriate ways of implementing RJ in IPV situations among Muslims. Given the prevalence of IPV among Muslims, the question is particularly important and timely. Taking exclusively limited examples of RJ approaches that have been used to mediate IPV cases in Muslim countries and communities, this paper found one significant challenge in the RJ approaches among Muslims: inappropriate norms/understandings about IPV. To reduce IPV in Muslim society, it is necessary to develop treatment models and techniques that meet cultural and religious needs. This paper found that since RJ is not alien to Islamic teachings, RJ approaches can be implemented effectively in dealing with IPV among Muslims by ensuring justice and equity of the abused woman. The findings of this paper will assist policymakers, practitioners, and service providers in providing religiously and culturally appropriate care when addressing IPV issues among Muslims.",TRUE,FALSE,Intimate partner violence|Islam|Religion|Restorative justice|Social work,2018-07-02T11:41:31.665198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-03T15:29:37.997275,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Taylor &amp; Francis,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/citation/,jmbua,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u4pax/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/relationships/node/,u4pax,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9a1cf1f6318700100cd22b/,5a9a1cf1f6318700100cd22b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jmbua/,https://doi.org/10.1080/15426432.2018.1440277,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jmbua

sensitive to critiques of the policy as regressive, costly or ineffective. The deduction is a popular
social policy that lowers the cost of owning a home for some homeowners by enabling them to deduct their mortgage interest payments from their federal tax liability. Although the deduction enjoys broad public support, critics argue that it disproportionately benefits wealthy households, fails to expand homeownership opportunities to households on the margins and costs the federal
government an extraordinary amount of money in foregone tax revenue. Drawing on data
collected through an on-line experiment, this analysis tests the sensitivity of public support to
these critiques. The findings reveal that support for the mortgage interest deduction declines
when respondents are presented with information about the cost, effectiveness or distribution of benefits associated with the deduction. Disaggregating support by political party and homeownership status reveals that support among renters is more sensitive to framing effects than that of homeowners. Republicans are less sensitive to framing effects than Democrats when the deduction is framed as distributing benefits unequally, but more sensitive to these effects when the issues is framed as costly. However, all groups register their lowest level of support when told that the mortgage interest deduction is not an effective tool for expanding ownership opportunities.",TRUE,FALSE,homeownership|housing|mortgage interest deduction|public opinion,2018-07-02T11:41:31.063568,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-02T12:59:55.789170,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Brian J.

Using recently digitized maps that precisely show neighborhoods marked with red ink (highest risk) or yellow ink (slightly lower risk), I document that surveyors disproportionately assigned the most restrictive credit rating to neighborhoods with black residents. Nearly 90 percent of African Americans in 1940 lived in a census tract marked for credit redlining. Comparing credit-restricted ""redlined"" census tracts to adjacent ""yellow-lined"" tracts, I estimate the long-run effects of redlining on housing and neighborhood outcomes. Between 1940 and 1970, redlining was associated with large differential declines in housing supply and population density; homeownership rates and racial composition did not change differentially from their 1940 baseline though. Once discriminatory lending was outlawed during the mid-1970s, there was moderate convergence in homeownership rates and racial composition. However, housing supply and population density remain persistently lower in formerly credit-restricted census tracts relative to their credit-favored neighbors. Although African-American neighborhoods were much more likely to be redlined, I show the effects do not vary by a neighborhood’s initial share of African American residents. Results also hold when restricting the sample to neighborhoods without any black residents in 1940. Taken together, these findings suggest redlining impacted neighborhood housing supply and population independent of pre-war patterns of racial segregation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:41:30.621279,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-02T12:57:35.114533,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/citation/,jdmq9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uxeaz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/relationships/node/,uxeaz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9832da218b7b000f148e6f/,5a9832da218b7b000f148e6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jdmq9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jdmq9

Past research indicates that these influencers are regarded as opinion leaders and cooperate with brands to market products on YouTube through electronic-word-of-mouth mechanisms.

In our article, we make a first attempt to quantify product promotion and use an original dataset of 139,475 videos created by German YouTube channels between 2009 and 2017.

""Made in"" fra integrazione europea ed ordinamenti giuridici nazionali. Dopo una ampia premessa introduttiva, volta ad inquadrare l'argomento nel contesto evolutivo dell'integrazione europea e i suoi recenti sviluppi in chiave ""personalista"", i due capitoli centrali affrontano il tema definendo il concetto giuridico di ""origine"" ai fini della c.d. ""comunicazione commerciale"", gli obblighi europei e nazionali in materia di etichettatura, presentazione e pubblicità dei prodotti con riferimento alla specifica questione trattata, la politica UE di valorizzazione della qualità e le sue ricadute applicative nonché i residui spazi per la regolamentazione nazionale di marchi certificativi di origine, denominazioni geografiche ed attestazioni di tipicità. Il volume si conclude con una rilettura critica della giurisprudenza consolidata della Corte di giustizia UE alla luce della possibile natura di ""diritto culturale"" della dichiarazione di origine delle merci e del nuovo approccio dell'Unione europea ai temi della tutela del consumatore e dei suoi diritti fondamentali, fra i quali la trasparenza e l'informazione.",TRUE,FALSE,consumer|denomination|label|made in Italy|mark guaranteeing the quality and origin,2018-07-02T11:41:29.461432,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-28T21:21:11.753382,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1c|Law|Food and Drug Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c79|Law|Consumer Protection Law,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/citation/,zkbm2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k7hx2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/relationships/node/,k7hx2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a96b64891b689000da308c3/,5a96b64891b689000da308c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zkbm2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zkbm2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zkbm2

The country is on course to reach replacement level fertility by 2020. Yet, there is a large degree of variation between states. In some areas, for example, total fertility rates are as low as 1.6 or 1.7.
Profound changes in fertility preferences have accompanied this fertility transition. In particular, there has been a strong shift towards a two-child norm. In recent years, however, there has been developing evidence of a growing ideation towards having just one-child. This phenomenon has been associated with the rise of the Indian middle class and has been the subject of some attention in both academic and popular circles. 
Using evidence from the National Family Health Survey, this chapter explores this phenomenon in the Indian context.  In doing so, we explore the possible implications both for the future direction of fertility transition in India, as well as for the family as an institution.",TRUE,FALSE,families|family size|fertility|India|one-child family|West Bengal,2018-07-02T11:41:29.184690,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-28T13:09:54.474293,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/citation/,mtd7x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7kj34/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/relationships/node/,7kj34,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a964f7891b689000ca61561/,5a964f7891b689000ca61561,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtd7x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mtd7x/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mtd7x
