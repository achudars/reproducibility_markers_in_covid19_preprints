It examined the percentage of teachers and students who perceived students’ rating as a tool for evaluating language instruction; it also tested to ascertain the significant differences in the perception of students’ rating as a tool for evaluating teachers’ language instruction. The population of the study comprised all the fourteen (14) lecturers and all the two hundred and twenty one (221) Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE) students of the English Department, College of Education, Warri in the 2015/2016 academic session. The manageable size of the population informed the researchers’ choice of purposively using the entire population as the sample for the study. Two research questions were answered and three research hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance. Two instruments titled Teachers’ Perception of Students’ Rating (TPSR) with a reliability coefficient of 0.68 and Students’ Perception of Students’ Rating (SPSR) with a reliability coefficient of 0.87 were used to gather data for the study. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The result of the study showed that there is no significant difference in the perception of NCE students on students’ rating as a tool for evaluating teachers’ instruction but data analysis revealed a significant difference in the perception of NCE students of different academic levels on students’ rating as a tool for evaluating teachers’ instruction. Furthermore, there is no significant difference in the perception of teachers of different academic qualifications and years of teaching experience on students’ rating as a tool for evaluating teachers’ instruction. It was concluded that students’ rating of teachers’ instruction should be adopted for quality education and academic excellence instead of the use of publications, paper presentation at conferences and workshops attendance for annual performance evaluation for teachers in College Education, Warri and similar institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Evaluation|Language Teaching|Perception|Rating Tool|Students|Teachers,2021-04-06T07:33:42.215409,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-06T07:33:13.809773,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/citation/,a3gqe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606b2afcf2ad3301a0a77fe0/,606b2afcf2ad3301a0a77fe0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3gqe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a3gqe/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.04.02.194,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a3gqe

The main goal of the study was to gather input from school stakeholders regarding daily conditions and functions, with the ultimate goal of improved administrative policy implementation. A literature review indicated no direct prior research. A survey gathered input from four stakeholder groups, including 15 teachers, 104 parents, 17 staff, and 3 administrators, regarding Physical Safety, Child Sense of Being Valued (classroom atmosphere), Classroom Conditions, Information Availability, Parent-Teacher Meeting Quality, Administrative Support, Parental Support (overall), Educational Tools and Technology, Quality of Peer Professional Relationships, and Availability of Needed Supplies. Stakeholders rated the daily operations areas using five-point Likert-style questions and responded to two open-ended questions. In sum, findings highlighted a number of useful perspectives for the little-studied early-childhood administrative community: a) seemingly mundane school functions are important to those who experience them on a regular basis; b) all stakeholder input is valuable when gathering school daily operations feedback; c) similarities and differences in stakeholder input help administrators develop a more holistic perspective of school functioning; and d) stakeholder input is a valuable tool for administrators to use when critically considering responsive policy formulation.

In 2018 the legal unit area of Polda Metro Jaya had the highest number of cases of 5,526 cases of financial crimes. This study seeks to examine the determinant aspects of financial crime in Indonesia. I used the illustration of the case of First Travel and the Koperasi Simpan Pinjam (KSP) Pandawa that occurred in Indonesia with a total loss of up to IDR 1 trillion. Discussions in this paper begin from the point of view of white collar crime that elaborated with criminaloid and organizational criminogenic aspects. This study uses a grounded theory method through in-depth interviews of actors. The result is that on the criminaloid aspect, the perpetrators have a tendency to easily confess, have certain social and cultural status, has moral sensitivity and intelligence, and has skills, but hesitates in acting. Meanwhile, in the organizational criminogenic aspect, it was found that the perpetrators were in an environment with profit-oriented ambitions, had certain business perceptions, had a loyal attitude towards their group and their human resources tended to be homogeneous. The results of this study found that a supportive situation is needed in financial crime based on the illustrations of the cases used. Situational criminogenic aspects in research in the form of business that utilize religious sentiments, use a cooperative system and manage funds with a Ponzi scheme. This research will enrich criminology studies, especially in the field of white collar crime.

Despite the importance of concealing information as a way to establish boundaries between the self and others, avoid stigma, and define the situation, sociology is missing a comprehensive understanding of what people conceal, as well as a general account of concealment that is broadly applicable to most types of concealable matters. In this paper, we address these gaps in knowledge in two ways. First, we examine a wide range of concealable topics, and investigate individual- and group-level differences in what people conceal. Second, we propose that norms of concealment and a desire for autonomy motivate concealment across a range of situations and matters. We find that norms and autonomy predict concealment. Our findings constitute a general explanation of what motivates individuals to conceal, and a way to augment and synthesize previously disconnected literatures.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-06T07:27:01.159750,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-06T07:26:34.330495,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,Maria Grigoryeva and Blaine Robbins,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/citation/,4xwkv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d7v69/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/relationships/node/,d7v69,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606b0770f2ad330192a77bba/,606b0770f2ad330192a77bba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xwkv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4xwkv/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4xwkv

By critically analysing several existing studies, it shows why the technique’s distinctive methodology (involving empirical calibration and validation) is just as important to its scientific contribution as its novel technical capabilities. The article shows the advantages of Agent-Based Models following this methodology and distinguishes these clearly from the implications of apparently similar techniques (like actor-based approaches). The article also discusses the limitations of existing Agent-Based Modelling applied to social networks, enabling the approach to make a more effective contribution to Network Science in future.",TRUE,FALSE,actor-based models|agent-based modelling|calibration|methodology|social network analysis|validation,2021-04-06T07:25:26.029558,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-06T07:25:10.570233,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,This is not a preregistration.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/citation/,bym74,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606aaab2f6585f015a6129ca/,606aaab2f6585f015a6129ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bym74/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bym74/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bym74
