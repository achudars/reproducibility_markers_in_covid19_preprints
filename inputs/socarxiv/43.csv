The method used in the study is mixed-method by distributing questionnaires to 2,772 respondents in three cities with the red zone status, i.e. Depok City, Medan City, and Surakarta City. The findings for this first phase obtained were processed using secondary sources based on academic literature. The findings show that (1) there are still many respondents who think Covid-19 is a hoax and conspiracy; (2) the participation of academic institutions and independent research institutions in sharing valid information regarding Covid-19 is still very low; (3) the government has not massively involved academic institutions to respond Covid-19. These three aspects are the reasons why Covid-19 is still a threat, especially for Indonesian citizens.

However, on-the-ground scholars and managers often approach win-win narratives skeptically, due to real-world complexity. Case-study meta-analyses find win-wins are relatively rare. Here, we show mathematically why complexity reduces the availability of win-wins. We provide a general proof that, under uncertainty, the probability a manager should assign to win-win outcomes (here meaning Pareto improvements) existing strictly decreases in: the number of objectives, the number of stakeholders, and the number of constraints. We show that the maximum fraction of single-objective best outcomes simultaneously achievable for all objectives—a measure of tradeoff severity—also decreases (i.e. tradeoff severity increases) in the number of objectives, and approaches a limit unaffected by tradeoff surface curvature. This is important because most empirically estimated two-dimensional tradeoff surfaces are concave—77%, we show in a meta-analysis. Concave tradeoffs are less severe—moreso in lower dimensions. Our model can extrapolate estimated low-dimensional tradeoff severities to arbitrary higher dimensions. Our results provide precise intuition and quantitative guidance for interpreting implications of simple tradeoff studies for complex realities.",TRUE,FALSE,environment|management|sustainability|tradeoff|win-win,2021-01-07T15:42:42.550119,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-07T13:08:23.955619,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.github.com/mattgburgess/tradeoffs,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/citation/,cfp43,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff4ebee1e6d9705d62fbeab/,5ff4ebee1e6d9705d62fbeab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfp43/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfp43/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfp43

To fill this gap, this article asks when, how, and why national identities have strong impact on public attitudes about events. The article introduces a theoretical framework, which integrates elements from humanistic philosophy, sociology of nationalism, political psychology, and sociology of emotions. National identity protects against existential threats but is precarious because the nation is a phantasmal object of identification whose 'existence' depends on contested narratives. Therefore, events that seem to threaten or promise to alter the perceived core elements of the nation (i.e., 'nation-disrupting events') evoke strong emotions, which motivate attitudinal shifts. Which affective reaction individuals experience depends on the meaning they attribute (spontaneously or in response to elite cues) to events vis-à-vis competing idealizations of the nation.",TRUE,FALSE,Emotions|Hot nationalism|Nation|Nationalism|Nationhood|Political attitudes|Political emotions|Public opinion|Sociological theory,2021-01-07T15:38:41.600639,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-07T13:03:47.410376,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,Yuval Feinstein,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/citation/,sxeb8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff4e3ac1e6d9705cb2fad64/,5ff4e3ac1e6d9705cb2fad64,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sxeb8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sxeb8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sxeb8

We conduct a survey experiment in which subjects had to rate the reliability of several statements in the fields of climate change, Covid-19, and artificial intelligence. There is some evidence for a monological belief system, i.e., being susceptible to one statement containing misinformation is correlated with falling to other false news stories, in all three contexts. The main findings to explain the susceptibility to misinformation can be summarized as follows: trust in social networks is positively associated with falling for misinformation in all contexts. There are also several context-related differences: Individuals are less likely to be susceptible to misinformation in the contexts of climate change and Covid-19 if they have a higher risk perception, tend to take a second look at a problem (i.e., willingness to think deliberately), update their prior beliefs to new evidence (actively open-minded thinking), and trust in science and mass media.

The context of these protests and how police reacted to them varied substantially, with limited understanding of relevant public attitudes. Public opinion is double-edged; it is critical for police legitimacy and influences criminal justice policy, but it also often reflects racial animus. We hypothesized that disruptive, dangerous, or unlawful protest tactics would increase support for police control, by elevating public fear, but also that support for repression would be higher when protest goals conflict with preexisting racial beliefs. To test our hypotheses, we embedded an experiment in a nationwide survey fielded in 2020, after George Floyd’s killing sparked the broadest protests in U.S. history. We randomized protest tactics (e.g., weapon carrying, violence) and goals, as well as other contextual characteristics (e.g., protest size). We found that the public generally opposed repressive protest policing. However, certain protest tactics increased support for repression by increasing public fear. Protest goals (e.g., pro-Black Lives Matter, anti-COVID-19 restrictions, or pro-confederate monuments) also impacted support for repression, but the effect depended on respondents’ racial beliefs.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-07T09:26:21.989389,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-07T08:58:08.810435,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",N/A,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/citation/,7hcwp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff4d094e9ccb905b8aed08a/,5ff4d094e9ccb905b8aed08a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hcwp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7hcwp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7hcwp

The speeches and statements of minority women deputies highlighted their perspectives on the multifaceted crisis of the Soviet Union. Some of the women represented especially marginalized groups, like the indigenous peoples of the Far East and mountain herders of Kirghizia, and for the first time gained the opportunity to express their grievances in a public debate. The article focused on the grievances, which minority women deputies articulated, and the solutions, which they proposed for mitigating or overcoming them. The study was informed by the concepts of intersectionality and the imperial situation. Although nationality (ethnicity) was an important self-categorization for many of those minority women who spoke at the five congresses, the meanings, ascribed to ethnonational categories, and the policy proposals, deriving from them, were very different. Even when grievances were “nationalized,” the proposed solutions could also be anti-nationalist. Besides, the same grievances could be refracted not only through nationality but also through gender, regional, local, occupational, and other categories.

Drawing on a sample of 2,509 e-mails sent to Florida Governor Jeb Bush in response to his efforts to reinsert the hydration and nutrition tubes of Terri Schiavo, we analyze how individuals pair (in)civility and emotional expressions in their claimsmaking. We find that emails sent to Bush about the Schiavo case are largely polite, even when individuals’ disagreed with Bush’s intervention on Terri’s behalf. We also find that individuals expressed a lot of emotion in their emails, and that the first emotional expression typically was negative. In order to better understand the relationship between (in)civility and emotional expression, we qualitatively analyze the messaging in the 383 emails containing incivility, and find that individuals directed negative emotional expressions at different targets. Emailers expressing negative emotions and incivility at Bush largely criticize him for violating individual rights, and, nearly half, blast him for prioritizing the Schiavo case over other problems facing the state. In contrast, emailers expressing negative emotions  and incivility at Terri’s husband and a prominent judge try to persuade Bush to hold one or both of these men accountable for Terri’s death. We conclude the paper by underscoring the utility in distinguishing emotional expression from (in)civility.",TRUE,FALSE,civility|Death with dignity|digital communication|email|emotion|framing|incivility|pro life|uncivil language,2021-01-07T15:21:02.165188,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-07T12:57:46.160576,FALSE,NA,no,This data is available through the Florida State Archives.

I argue that governments redistribute to electorally important groups defined by multiple dimensions (such as age, parental status, and income), and that this multidimensional redistribution helps explain the evolution of income inequality. Using a difference-in-differences method, I find that governments within the United Kingdom redistribute more to electorally important groups after changes in power, and that this multidimensional redistribution also has a significant impact on income inequality.

In current times of economic crisis, it may even involve a painful past with lost social, civil, gender and/or class struggles, a depressing present with abandoned, fragmented, degraded landscapes and ravaged factories, and a hopeless future for the former workers of the local (not only) society; or just a conquerable ground for controversial investments. This is certainly an emotionally charged subject matter, with multiple readings and interpretations.
However, this view is only partial when facing landscape during its historical evolution process. A diachronic study, thus, embraces all resources that probably gave rise to a variety of human activities; all of them embody heritage values -“subjectively” or “objectively” perceived- their evaluation, though, is a matter of an on-going process of the civil society.
Greece's landscape accommodates a diversity of diachronic productive practices that may overlap historical periods, technological evolutions and social transformations. Pre-, early and industrial exploitation of resources does not remain firm but vary according to time and the needs of each society. The comparative scale of certain resource exploitation is highlighted as the key for the assessment methodology in close relation to the specific frame of a local landscape and a historical period.
Even though archaeological evidence may possibly reveal and document continuity in a range of sustainable productive processes without conflicts, great controversies emerge when new investments are “offered” as an antidote to economic crisis -not harmonized to the local scale, traumatizing thus the “spirit” of the landscape. Suggestions for incompatible productive use and investment planning imply irreversible and irreparable effects on the environment, society and economy of a region and are only faced through social awareness. Case studies of passive and/or active involvement of local communities, in synthesizing and enhance landscape’s “spirit”, its diachronic industrial heritage and the embedded tangible and intangible values, will support a pragmatic -not a suspended- step towards a sustainable future. 
Quoting Neil Cossons (TICCIH Congress 2012) “Industrial imperialism ensures its position and protects its future not by the conquest of distant lands as by the securing of its sources of raw materials ...
