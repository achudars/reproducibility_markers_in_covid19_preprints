Many social scientists confuse prediction with unnecessarily complicated methods, or narrowly predicting the future. This is unfortunate, because prediction understood as the simple process of evaluating a model outside of the sample used for estimation is a much more general, and disarmingly simple technique that brings a host of benefits to our empirical workflow. One needn't use complicated methods or be solely concerned with predicting the future to use prediction, nor is it necessary to resolve the centuries-old philosophical debate between prediction and explanation to appreciate its benefits. Prediction can and should be used as a simple complement to the rich methodological tradition in the social sciences, and is equally applicable across a vast multitude of modelling approaches, owing to its simplicity and intuitive nature. For all its simplicity, the value of prediction should not be underestimated. Prediction can address some of the most enduring sources of criticism plaguing the social sciences, like lack of external validity and the use of overly simplistic models to capture social life. In this paper, I illustrate these benefits with a host of empirical examples that merely skim the surface of the many and varied ways in which prediction can be applied, staking the claim that prediction is one of those illustrious `free lunches' that can greatly benefit the empirical social sciences.",TRUE,FALSE,Computational Social Sciences|Model Diagnostics|Prediction,2021-04-07T11:24:41.057789,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-07T11:22:46.548766,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/MarkDVerhagen/Pragmatist_Guide_to_Prediction,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/citation/,tjkcy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606d9170f6585f029a6188c0/,606d9170f6585f029a6188c0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjkcy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tjkcy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tjkcy,NA

This paper analyses how the characteristics of the recipient country shapes individual support for financial help across borders. Existing literature has shown that individuals are more likely to show solidarity with their co-nationals than for individuals in other countries. However, people might show different levels of solidarity towards different foreign countries depending on their geographical or cultural proximity, their economic conditions or political ties. We make use of a survey experiment asking respondents in 14 European countries whether they think their country should provide financial help to 35 foreign countries in the event of a major crisis to assess different heuristics of international solidarity (need; reciprocity; identity; attitude). We show that shared borders, a common language, geographical proximity and common membership in the European Union are associated with a higher probability of solidarity. We find that ideology has a substantial moderating effect: left-wing and right-wing individuals differ substantially in how they support solidarity with other countries: the solidarity of right-wing individuals across borders is much more conditional (on EU membership, geographical proximity, trade ties) than the solidarity of left-wing individuals.",TRUE,FALSE,European Union|International Relations|Redistribution|Solidarity,2021-04-07T13:56:06.179396,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-07T13:55:29.589077,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/67584,no,No pre-registration.,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/citation/,a75wx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5u8dn/,5u8dn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606d5ef0f2ad33029ca743bd/,606d5ef0f2ad33029ca743bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a75wx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a75wx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a75wx,NA

However, in some countries, centralization in the name of public health was not the only motive. The COVID-19 response coincided with broader worldwide trends towards democratic backsliding and authoritarian consolidation. Some of these efforts happened while the world was preoccupied with responding to the pandemic without concretely referencing Coronavirus; however, in other cases, public health rationales are clearly and explicitly invoked as a pretext for actions that instead aid the consolidation of regime authority. This has been especially pernicious in subnational democracy, where efforts have been made to undermine the ability of opposition parties to fairly contest in local and regional politics. This paper looks at four cases in which political actors either opportunistically used worldwide distraction from the COVID-19 pandemic or explicitly invoked public health while seeking to undermine long-term domestic contestation in their jurisdictions: Hong Kong, Hungary, Uganda, and the United States. We examine the use of public health as a pretext for undermining opposition parties, recentralizing political authority in dominant actors, and inhibiting the fair contestation of elections.",TRUE,FALSE,autocratization|COVID-19|democratic backsliding|Hong Kong|Hungary|opportunism|pretext|subnational democracy|Uganda|United States,2021-04-07T13:59:42.593452,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-07T13:59:10.498803,FALSE,NA,no,All information for the case studies is cited and available online.,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/citation/,6wvg7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606c768951f7ae0208f55252/,606c768951f7ae0208f55252,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6wvg7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6wvg7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6wvg7,NA

We show that restrictive immigration policies exclude most Chinese migrants from legal entry into the US, force many to endure dangerous migration routes, incur extraordinary debt and bind Chinese migrants’ experience of illegality with asylum seeking. The asylum regime is putatively humanitarian but inflicts legal violence on migrants and diverts efforts away from collective organizing for rights-based remedies towards debt-fueled migration and asylum seeking, a process that keeps migrants in lengthy periods of legal precarity and reproduces national and global inequalities.

worker-client relationship. However, in doing so, platforms create a new source of subordination to the platform itself. We term this phenomenon ‘subordinated agency’, and
demonstrate that it entails a ‘structured antagonism’ with platforms that manifests in three areas: fees, competition, and worker voice mechanisms. Subordinated agency creates worker desire for representation, greater voice, and even unionisation towards the platform, while

This article takes advantage of a unique dataset that includes surveys from activists who organized the nationally coordinated climate strikes in the US that began with Fridays for Future in spring 2019. Building on the research on alliance building and strategic coalitions, this article analyzes how the patterns of participation changed over the period of the study. We employ social network analysis to map the affiliation networks among the organizers of these events to assess the coalitions of groups involved and the shifting organizational landscape. Our analysis does not provide evidence that groups spanned the boundaries across movements, nor does it show that identity played a role in coalition building in this movement. Instead, by mapping out the coalition of organizations within this movement and how connections among them change over time, we see clear evidence that this youth-led movement was reoriented by adult-led organizations. Our article concludes by considering how these findings suggest the future trajectory of the youth climate movement and its role in a ‘new climate politics’ in America.",TRUE,FALSE,climate activism|climate strike|coalitions|Fridays for Future|social movements|youth climate movement,2021-04-07T13:41:05.613115,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-07T13:40:27.949176,FALSE,NA,no,Data are still being analyzed for another project.,,no,A preregistration was not created for this project,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements",Fisher and Nasrin,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/citation/,nuhyz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606c3b55f6585f01da61989f/,606c3b55f6585f01da61989f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nuhyz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nuhyz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nuhyz,https://doi.org/10.17645/pag.v9i2.3801
