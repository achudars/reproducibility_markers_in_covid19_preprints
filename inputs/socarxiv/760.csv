Proponents claim it will fuel a research revolution, but skeptics challenge it as unreliably measured and decontextualized, with limited utility for accurately answering social science research questions. We argue that social scientists need effective tools to quantify big data’s measurement error and expand the contextual information associated with it. Standard research efforts in many fields already pursue these goals through data augmentation, the systematic assessment of measurement against known quantities and expansion of extant data by adding new information. Traditionally, these tasks are accomplished using trained research assistants or specialized algorithms. However, such approaches may not be scalable to big data or appease its skeptics. We consider a third alternative that may increase the validity and value of big data: data augmentation with online crowdsourcing. We present three empirical cases to illustrate the strengths and limits of crowdsourcing for academic research, with a particular eye to how they can be applied to data augmentation tasks that will accelerate acceptance of big data among social scientists. The cases use Amazon Mechanical Turk to (1) verify automated coding of the academic discipline of dissertation committee members, (2) link online product pages to a book database, and (3) gather data on mental health resources at colleges. In light of these cases, we consider the costs and benefits of augmenting big data with crowdsourcing marketplaces and provide guidelines on best practices. We also offer a standardized reporting template that will enhance reproducibility.

Manchester: Manchester University Press. [Pre-review version]

June 30, 2006 marked the release of An Inconvenient Truth (AIT), a climate
change documentary presented and written by leading US Democrat politician
Al Gore. The film has contributed to making climate change expertise public
through a heady combination of scientific data with personal stories and
calls for political action that offered a particular social representation
of climate change. In this chapter we discuss AIT as an example of taking
climate change expertise out of the pages of science journals and into the
public sphere. We draw on the ideas of John Dewey and their elucidation by
Mark Brown to show how the notion of expertise is key in understanding the
film’s motivation, successes and critics. While the purpose of the
documentary was to persuade its audience of the consensual truth imparted
by climate science experts, its effect was to become a lightning rod for
dissent, critique and debate of that expertise. Overall, AIT created a
dominant representation of climate change, based on expertise that became a
touchstone for consent and dissent, action and reaction.

In the following we shall first provide some background to the film’s
emergence, highlighting its echoes of Dewey’s argument that expert
knowledge should be integrated in society. We then use the concept of
social representation to show how Gore combined scientific content with
personal and political context in order to provide a meaningful
representation of climate change expertise. We then highlight how AIT
sought to create its own public for scientific expertise, returning climate
science expertise to society as one of the many tools with which citizens
make sense of the world and solve problems. We then show how the very
elements that helped AIT towards establishing a dominant social
representation of climate change also contributed to the creation of a
counter-representation and counterpublic that questioned how AIT
represented climate science expertise. With AIT’s success in bringing
social context to scientific content came inevitable contestation. We
conclude with some tentative lessons for science communicators from the AIT
story.

ties and behaviors like smoking, but the role of social isolates is poorly
understood. Some theories predict isolated adolescents are protected from
peer influence that increases smoking, while others suggest isolates are
more likely to initiate smoking because they lack social control provided
by peer friendships. Building on a growing literature that seeks to explain
these contradictions by moving beyond a homogeneous understanding of
isolation, we identify the relationships between smoking and three distinct
dimensions of isolation: avoided (adolescents who do not receive ties),
withdrawn (adolescents who do not send ties), and externally oriented
(adolescents who claim close out-of-grade friends). We examine the
coevolutionary effects of these dimensions and cigarette smoking using an
autoregressive latent trajectory model (ALT) with PROSPER Peers, a unique,
longitudinal networks dataset. These data include students (47% male and
86% White) from rural Iowa and Pennsylvania, ranging successively from
grades 6-12 in eight waves of data. As a robustness check, we use a
stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to compare to results from the ALT.
We find avoided isolation and external orientation are associated with
decreased successive smoking in high school, while smoking increases
subsequent isolation along all three dimensions, with particularly strong
effects on withdrawn isolation.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:09.061263,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-23T21:41:21.015000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/citation/,surjx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5nfx7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/relationships/node/,5nfx7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e5a185594d9001f391929e/,57e5a185594d9001f391929e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/surjx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/surjx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/surjx,https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2017.9

This study examined the association between presence of e-cigarette specialty retailers near schools and e-cigarette use among middle and high school students in Orange County (OC), CA.

Methods. The OC subsample of the 2013-2014 California Healthy Kids Survey (N=67,701) was combined with geocoded e-cigarette retailers to determine whether a retailer was present within one-quarter mile of each public school in OC. Multilevel logistic regression models evaluated individual-level and school-level e-cigarette use correlates among middle and high school students.

Results. Among middle school students, the presence of an e-cigarette retailer within one-quarter mile of their school predicted lifetime e-cigarette use (OR = 1.70, 95% CI=1.02, 2.83), controlling for confounders but no effect for current use.

Racial and ethnic differentials in immunization of children may suggest differentials in access to health care. This research describes racial and ethnic differences in childhood influenza immunization coverage and identifies social and economic characteristics associated with these immunization differentials in Texas.
Methods: Using data from the National Immunization Survey racial and ethnic differences in seasonal influenza immunization among children is examined as related to social and economic characteristics of children in Texas over the period of 2004 to 2013.
Results: Findings suggest the presence of expected differences in childhood seasonal influenza immunization for Hispanic and non-Hispanic black children compared to non- Hispanic white children. Education and marital status of the mother are predictors of influenza immunization as is participation in WIC.
Conclusions: Implications of findings suggest the need for qualitative research to better understand barriers to immunization that differentially affect minority children in Texas. Addressing racial and ethnic immunization differentials among children may potentially result in reductions in other racial and ethnic health disparities as they age.",TRUE,FALSE,health disparities|immunization|influenza|preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:30.251839,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-22T14:49:13.417000,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/citation/,8mnwv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jxh6g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/relationships/node/,jxh6g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e3ef6a9ad5a1004a141853/,57e3ef6a9ad5a1004a141853,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8mnwv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8mnwv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8mnwv,NA
