Controlled studies of mice and non-human primates indicate Zika affects fecundity, raising concerns about miscarriage in human populations. In regions of Brazil, Zika risk peaked months before residents learned about the epidemic and its relation to congenital anomalies. This spatiotemporal variation supports analysis of both biological effects of Zika infection on fertility and the effects of learning about Zika risk on reproductive behavior. Causal inference techniques used with vital statistics indicate that the epidemic caused reductions of approximately one-quarter in birth cohort size 18 months after Zika infection risk peaked, but 10 months after public health messages advocated childbearing delay. The evidence is consistent with small, but not statistically detectable, biological reductions in fecundity, as well as large strategic changes in reproductive behavior to temporally align childbearing with reduced risk to infant health. The behavioral effects are larger for more educated and older women, which may reflect facilitated access to information and to family planning services within high-risk, mosquito-infested urban locations, as well as perceptions about the opportunity costs of risks to pregnancy and infant survival.",TRUE,FALSE,avoidance|Brazil|fecundity|fertility|tempo effects|Zika,2019-04-10T12:07:48.291618,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-10T12:07:23.360275,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/citation/,fu8bp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca90996641d100018bf55a3/,5ca90996641d100018bf55a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fu8bp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fu8bp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fu8bp,NA

We argue that ABMs can be extremely helpful to assess models when the phenomena under study is complex. As an example, we create an ABM to evaluate the estimation of selection and influence effects by SIENA, a stochastic actor-oriented model proposed by Tom A. B. Snijders and colleagues. It is a prominent network analysis method that has gained popularity during the last 10 years and been applied to estimate selection and influence for a broad range of behaviors and traits such as substance use, delinquency, violence, health, and educational attainment. However, we know little about the conditions for which this method is reliable or the particular biases it might have. The results from our analysis show that selection and influence are estimated by SIENA asymmetrically, and that with very simple assumptions, we can generate data where selection estimates are highly sensitive to mis-specification, suggesting caution when interpreting SIENA analyses.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based models|influence effects|networks|selection|SIENA|simulated data|simulation|stochastic actorâ€“based model,2019-04-05T20:44:49.175315,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T20:44:06.997965,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,SAGE,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/citation/,98fp4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca79620df977b0018f2ffae/,5ca79620df977b0018f2ffae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98fp4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/98fp4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/98fp4,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124119826147

Yet the chasm between them is a similarly enduring characteristic of the field of education studies. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the practice brief as an overlooked and grossly underutilized genre of scholarly writing in the field of higher educationâ€”in particular the field of community college studiesâ€”as one way to more intentionally address the research-practice gap. Crafted, as it so happens, as a practice brief, this paper posits a working definition, provides an overview of the genre in relation to other types of scholarly papers and other fields of study, and enumerates key characteristics of practice briefs to guide authors and peer reviewers. We discuss how practice briefs can be situated within a largely missing form of educational praxis and scholarship such as evidence-based practice (EBP). Lastly, we call on the higher education research community to include this genre in very specific terms within calls for journal submissions, in graduate programs, and in collaboration with practitioner partners.",TRUE,FALSE,academic publishing|community colleges|evidence based practice|practice brief|research practice gap,2019-04-05T20:44:10.833859,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T20:42:39.154147,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5b|Education|Community College Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/citation/,4nmbv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5w793/,5w793,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca79190df977b0019f2ebd2/,5ca79190df977b0019f2ebd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4nmbv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4nmbv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4nmbv,NA

Little is understood about natural disasters which has implications in planning humanitarian response. We examined the magnitude and direction of the association between exposure to natural disasters and physical, emotional, and sexual violence against children, and assessed the quality of the evidence. 

Methods: We searched 15 health and social science databases from first record until May 16, 2018. Publications describing all types of quantitative study design were eligible for inclusion. We presented study characteristics and quality in a narrative form and generated pooled estimates using a three-level random effects model. We evaluated Cochraneâ€™s Q with p-values below 0.10 and radial plots to assess heterogeneity. Planned subgroup analyses explored differential results by violence form, study design, and analysis method.

Results: 11 publications met inclusion criteria. The majority were cross-sectional studies examining physical or sexual violence in the United States. We found no evidence of a consistent association or directional influence between natural disasters and violence against children. Pooled estimates for combined outcomes had substantial heterogeneity [categorical outcomes: Q (df = 44) = 205.43, p &lt; 0.001 and continuous outcomes: Q (df = 4) = 68.63, p &lt; 0.001]. Subgroups without evidence of heterogeneity had confidence intervals that included a possible null effect. Our findings were mainly limited by inconsistencies in operational definitions of violence, a lack of representative sampling, and unclear establishment of temporal order between natural disaster exposure and violence outcomes. 

Conclusions: Based on the available evidence, we cannot confidently conclude that natural disasters increase the level or severity of violence against children above non-disaster settings, however heterogeneity and study quality hamper our ability to draw firm conclusions. More nuanced and rigorous research is needed to inform practice and policy as natural disasters increasingly affect human populations.",TRUE,FALSE,Child|Child protection|Emergency|Humanitarian crisis|Natural disaster|Violence,2019-04-05T15:36:07.299503,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T15:35:41.750841,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/citation/,bhu3w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca76c1bdf977b0019f2d278/,5ca76c1bdf977b0019f2d278,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bhu3w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bhu3w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bhu3w,NA

This approach captures the prototypical structure of concepts,  is fairly robust to pruning sparse terms as well as variation in text lengths within a corpus, and when used with pre-trained embeddings, can be used even when terms denoting concepts are absent from corpora and can be applied to bag-of-words datasets.

This preliminary scale was administered to 543 university students and 1,067 clinical participants along with measures of depression, meaning in life, borderline personality disorder, and impulsivity. The scale was reduced to 17 items following item analysis, factor and item response theory analyses, extreme groups comparisons, and examinations of criterion validity.

They make reference to an array of potentially harmful exposures occurring from birth to eighteen years of age and may be involved in the construction of health inequalities over the lifecourse. As with many simplified concepts, ACEs present limitations. They include diverse types of exposures, are often considered cumulatively, can be identified using prospective and retrospective approaches, and their multidimensional nature may lead to greater measurement error. From a public health perspective, ACEs are useful for describing the need to act upon complex social environments to prevent health inequalities at a population level. As the ACEs concept becomes popular in the context of policy interventions, concerns have emerged. As a probabilistic and population-level tool, it is not adapted to diagnose individual-level vulnerabilities, an approach which could ultimately exacerbate inequalities. Here, we present a critique of the ACEs framework, discussing its strengths and limits.",TRUE,FALSE,ACE|adverse childhood experiences|health inequalities|public health|social determinants,2019-04-05T00:57:03.803880,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T00:56:24.187237,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/citation/,jrbgn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca6440ac25afd0019e08114/,5ca6440ac25afd0019e08114,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jrbgn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jrbgn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jrbgn,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1474746419000101

It applies hybrid mixed effects regression models that partition between- and within-person variation to estimate parental savings and financial assets over time and across different households. The results suggest that coresidence with adult children led to decreases in parental assets and savings. In the years in which their children lived at home, parents held 24% less in financial assets and 23% less in savings compared to years when adult children were not present. By expanding previous research that shows a relationship between increasing economic insecurity, limited wealth, and the rise in coresidence among young adults, this study also offers broader implications for the interconnectivity of financial hardship across generations.",TRUE,FALSE,Coresidence|Family Economics|Inequality|Intergenerational Transfers|National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,2019-04-05T00:57:47.646102,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T00:57:01.536635,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/citation/,rw7cj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca62da724df750018c63e00/,5ca62da724df750018c63e00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw7cj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rw7cj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rw7cj,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12407

Religion scholars have argued that religion is multi-faceted and hence better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e. mosaics), versus a more traditional variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate these religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically-expected profiles, our second step is to use stochastic actor based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the distinct structure of profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence. Results show evidence of adolescents influencing one anotherâ€™s religious mosaics, but not selecting friends on that basis.",TRUE,FALSE,Add Health|adolescents|latent class analysis|religion|social networks|stochastic actor-based models,2019-04-05T11:10:47.544479,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05T11:08:57.943275,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/citation/,dc5gh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca60b5824df750017c7131e/,5ca60b5824df750017c7131e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dc5gh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dc5gh,https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12638
