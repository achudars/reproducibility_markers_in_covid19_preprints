It allows for collateral posting adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out the market price of a collateralized contract. This framework is very useful for valuing outstanding derivatives. Using a unique dataset, we find empirical evidence that credit risk alone is not overly important in determining credit-related spreads. Only accounting for both collateral arrangement and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of derivatives. We also empirically gauge the impact of collateral agreements on risk measurements. Our findings indicate that there are important interactions between market and credit risk. https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dh9mr/download",TRUE,FALSE,asset pricing|collateralization|CVA|interaction between market and credit risk|plumbing of financial system|swap premium spread|VaR,2019-09-14T11:44:49.938499,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-14T11:44:28.673171,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/citation/,dh9mr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7c29517483ec001850e5a7/,5d7c29517483ec001850e5a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dh9mr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dh9mr

Moore is among the most prominent normative theorists to argue that retributive justice, understood as the deserved suffering of offenders, justifies punishment. Moore claims that the principle of retributive justice is pervasively supported by our judgments of justice and sufficient to ground punishment. We offer an experimental assessment of these two claims, (1) the pervasiveness claim, according to which people are widely prone to endorse retributive judgments, and (2) the sufficiency claim, according to which no non-retributive principle is necessary for justifying punishment. We test these two claims in a survey and a related survey experiment in which we present participants (N = ~900) with the stylized description of a criminal case. Our results seem to invalidate claim (1) and provide mixed results concerning claim (2).

How extent of meat restriction impacts individual dietary experience,"There are a variety of approaches to addressing meat overconsumption including forms of meat restriction that vary by the degree of reductions and the type of meat reduced. This study examines three such diets—a vegetarian diet, a reduced-meat diet, and a chicken-free diet—with a focus on the differences in the lived dietary experiences of their adherents. These lived experiences are operationalized using a variety of measures: satisfaction with food-related life, social ties, convenience, social/personal life, health, cost, motivation, identity, perception of prevalence rates, length of diet adherence, and the theory of planned behavior (intentions, attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms). The data comes from an online survey of a cross-sectional, census-balanced sample of more than 30,0000 U.S. residents aged 18+ years sourced from Nielsen’s Harris Panel. The results showed meat reducers to be a larger group than previously suspected, with a third of American adults self-identifying as reducing their meat consumption, compared to one percent each who identify as a vegetarian or chicken avoider. The findings also demonstrated that a vegetarian diet had the strongest lived dietary experiences among American adults who are currently eating one of the meat-restricted diets.

Among the most striking impacts are the demographic contraction of modern humans into southern refugia and the potential formation of a population bottleneck. In Iberia and southern France transformations also included the occurrence of significant technological changes, mostly marked by the emergence of a diverse set of bifacially-shaped stone projectiles. The rapid dissemination of bifacial technologies and the geographical circumscription of specific projectile morphologies within these regions have been regarded as evidence for: (1) the existence of a system of long-distance exchange and social alliance networks; (2) the organization of human groups into cultural facies with well-defined stylistic territorial boundaries. However, the degree and modes in which cultural transmission have occurred within these territories, and how it may have influenced other domains of the adaptive systems, remains largely unknown. Using southern Iberia as a case-study, this paper presents the first quantitative approach to the organization of lithic technology and its relationship to hunter-gatherers' territorial organization during the LGM. Similarities and dissimilarities in the presence of metric and morphological data describing lithic technologies are used as a proxy to explore modes and degrees of cultural transmission.

Young people in the UK are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), despite STI testing being freely and confidentially available. Given multiple barriers they may face for attending sexual health clinics (SHCs), young people should be consulted regarding changes to care. Studies have shown that point-of-care tests (POCTs) for STIs, which can accurately diagnose and treat patients in one clinical visit, have potential for individual and public health benefits, yet patient opinions of changes to clinical practice associated with POCT implementation are less understood.
Methods
The Precise study explored patient experiences of UK SHC services and their opinions of POCT implementation plans; here we focus on young participants within the Precise study. Male and female attendees of three SHCs in England were purposively sampled and then invited to participate in a qualitative in-depth interview. Interviews were conducted one-on-one, in person or via telephone, were audio-recorded and transcribed. NVivo (V10) was used to organise data for our content-based analysis.
Results
Ten young people aged 17-22 years, including: three women-who-have-sex-with-men, four men-who-have-sex-with-women and three men-who-have-sex-with-men were interviewed between June 2015 and February 2016. Participants reported SHCs as the best place to receive results because treatment could be stared immediately, with advice and information available. Participants discussed the potential for POCTs to reduce anxiety currently felt waiting for laboratory results. POCTs were found broadly acceptable, and were generally regarded as an innovation to improve SHC experiences. Participants with less previous SHC experience raised concerns that implementation of POCTs could negatively affect the amount and quality of time patients spend in consultations with clinicians and that changes to pathways may cause confusion in clinic.
Conclusions
We advise POCT implementation be accompanied by SHC staff communicating changes in clinical pathways to patients, including method and timeline for receiving results. Our participants valued face-to-face counselling and advice currently experienced in SHCs; these findings emphasise that POCT implementation plans safe-guard these aspects of care. Our findings suggest that POCT implementation in SHCs has potential to improve young people’s clinical experiences, which may facilitate attendance.",TRUE,FALSE,antibiotic resistance|antimicrobial resistance|point of care|point-of-care tests|sexual health|sexually transmitted infections|young people,2019-09-12T14:41:24.534492,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12T14:40:50.589752,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/citation/,25y36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tvn8z/,tvn8z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a4d857483ec00194fa920/,5d7a4d857483ec00194fa920,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25y36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/25y36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/25y36

New plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) provide a means to enhance PMF systems more quickly and with greater precision than ever before, and have the potential to produce health and health-related products that are superior to current mammalian systems. However, the feasibility, regulatory standing and social acceptability of both PMF and NPBTs are in question. This paper qualitatively explores the perceptions of key stakeholders on two European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 programmes – Pharma-Factory and Newcotiana – towards the barriers and facilitators of PMF and NPBTs in Europe. One-on-one qualitative interviews were undertaken with N=20 individuals involved in one or both of the two projects at 16 institutions in seven countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain and the UK). The findings indicate that the current EU regulatory environment and the perception of the public towards biotechnology are seen as the main barriers to scaling-up PMF and NPBTs. Competition from existing systems and the lack of plant-specific regulations likewise present challenges for PMF developing beyond its current niche. However, respondents felt that the communication of the benefits and purpose of NPBT PMF could provide a platform for improving the social acceptance of genetic modification. The importance of the media in this process was highlighted. This article explores the justifications used by scientists for the use of NPBTs for crop improvement and suggests that the multi-level perspective framework is a useful tool for understanding the systemic factors that have shaped the development of PMF up until today.",TRUE,FALSE,Barriers and Facilitators|New Plant Breeding Techniques|Plant Molecular Farming|Qualitative Research|Responsible Research and Innovation,2019-09-12T14:40:22.443175,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12T14:40:01.632803,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/citation/,gwve2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a3ac79defac0017165714/,5d7a3ac79defac0017165714,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gwve2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gwve2
