It is often juxtaposed with the destructive forces of war and conflict. Nye’s romanticizing over nature gave it a glorified appeal and brought forth its nobility and magnanimity. Her subtle way of intermingling aspects of nature with daily individual experience touches the heart. In her poetry and prose, nature appears to be the connector and the comforter, and at times, it is the spiritual and the sublime.

Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements. Culture plays an important role in the course of the idiom interpretation. Only by having a solid foundation of the culture of the target language, the translator can catch the implied meaning. It, therefore, requires enhancing cross-cultural awareness and needs open-minded understanding of the culture of the second language from different aspects. Moreover, the difference between the source language and the target language as well as variations in their cultures makes the process of translating a real challenge. The present paper tries to investigate and identify firstly some existing obstacles in the process of translating idiomatic pairs, and then suggests some theoretical strategies to overcome such difficulties. Following Baker’s (1992) classification of difficulties and strategies and the related sub-categories, the findings show that there are number of factors which should be considered in order to translate idiomatic expressions correctly. The most important of such factors include socio-linguistic elements, cultural aspects, linguistic and stylistic considerations.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic translation|classification of idioms|idioms|translation difficulties|translation strategies,2018-07-02T11:10:45.497568,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:00:54.330596,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/citation/,pfxtd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qxgep/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/relationships/node/,qxgep,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab61806c613b02546a48ce/,59ab61806c613b02546a48ce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfxtd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfxtd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfxtd

Using a national random sample of American adults, this study examines the link between religion, gender traditionalism, and attitudes toward same-sex unions by utilizing a novel measure of gender traditionalism that is distinctly religious as well. Recent work on images of God reveals that individuals’ views of the divine provide a glimpse of their underlying view of reality. The results suggest that individuals who view God as a “he” are much less favorable toward same-sex unions than those who do not view God as masculine, even while controlling for gender traditionalist beliefs and other images of God. Individuals who view God as masculine are signaling a belief in an underlying gendered reality that influences their perceptions of the proper ordering of that reality, which extends to marriage patterns.

For achieving this aim, we adopt meta-synthesis research design with nine selected qualitative case studies. We identified through our analysis the patterns of causal relationships among the variables presented on the case studies. The antecedents of social capital dimensions, the influence of the dimensions on reducing barrier or impediments for innovation and on the enhancement of enablers or facilitators of innovation outcomes, and the direct effects of social capital dimensions on innovation compose the resulting framework. We found a balanced relation among the dimensions on interorganizational settings, with a prevalence of the relational dimension. Regarding interorganizational networks, we perceived a reduced role of structural dimension and the absence of the influence of social capital dimension of reducing barriers or impediments for innovation.",TRUE,FALSE,social capital dimensions; social embeddedness; innovation; technology; meta-synthesis.,2018-07-02T11:09:33.407249,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-31T14:53:25.602161,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,The authors,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/citation/,5tzvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j4gxs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/relationships/node/,j4gxs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a820f36c613b0253692ad9/,59a820f36c613b0253692ad9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tzvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5tzvx/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5tzvx

Therefore, the main objective of the dissertation is to provide a description of the progressivity expressions in the Hassawi dialect. These expressions denote several meanings: duration, contingent happenings, temporariness, incompletion of actions and, in some instances, they show a ‘temporal frame effect’. It is argued that there are 13 means that denote progressivity in the Hassawi Dialect. Four of them were found in the literature. There are lexical main verbs functioning as aspectual verbs that express continuation such as: the simple form that consists of the imperfective form of activity, accomplishment, frequency, and passive meaning verbs that occur in all tenses and it is used interchangeably with the other progressive constructions showing that there is no opposition between the simple form and the progressive form. In addition, the active participles ‘gaaᶜid/jaalis’ that mean ‘sitting, remaining, staying’ in all tenses, the perfective verbs ‘jalas/gaᶜad’ meaning ‘sat, stayed’and ‘tamm/ Zal’that mean ‘stay,remain.completed’ and ‘stay,reman,continue’, respectively,  in the past and the imperfective verbs ‘yagᶜid/yajils –iyZil/iytimm’ in the present and the future preceding the imperfective form of activity, accomplishment, frequency, and passive meaning verbs and in very few cases with the state and achievement verbs. On the other hand, there is also a prepositional phrase ‘fiᶜizz’ behaving aspectually and denoting progressivity in all tenses followed by activity, accomplishment, frequency and a few state verbal nouns. Additionally, there is the active participle of some translocative, activity and very few state verbs in affirmative sentences and with a lot of the activity, and accomplishment verbs in the negative sentences in the present, past and the future. The imperfective and the perfective means are normally negated by ‘maa’ and for the purpose of intensifying the same action or introducing another action, ‘mu’, its variants and the negative copula are used instead. The perfective ‘Zal/tamm’ is either preceded by the negation particle denoting a progressive reading or followed by the negation particle indicating two readings; habitual or progressive. The active participles and the prepositional phrase denoting progressivity are negated by the particle ‘mu’normally in the present tense and by ‘maa’ in the past and the future tenses. Finally, the progressive construction in Hassawi dialect shows clear evidence that support Anderson’s localistic theory which indicates that the notion of location and direction is involved in the different aspect expressions in many languages.  In one construction, a locative participle is used and in the other one, a locative prepositional phrase is used.",TRUE,FALSE,accomplishment|activity|contingent happenings|frequency|localistic theory|progressivity expressions,2018-07-02T11:09:32.573244,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-31T01:47:00.292203,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/citation/,udygv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s4uh8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/relationships/node/,s4uh8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a768819ad5a1025f818f56/,59a768819ad5a1025f818f56,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udygv/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.188,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udygv
