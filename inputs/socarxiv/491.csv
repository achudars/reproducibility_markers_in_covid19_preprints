This essay explores the similarities of 52 small-city gay bars to each other, and their differences from big-city gayborhood bars. Small-city gay bars are surprisingly integrated with straight people in their often red-state communities and are as racially diverse than the counties in which they reside. They are subcultural amenities not just for LGBT people but for straights as well, fostering cosmopolitan lifestyles for large geographical regions. 

I conclude with an argument for the importance of small cities to understand urbanism generally. Small cities are a key analytic object to disentangle urban effects from modern life generally. They reveal the way in which contemporary urban scholars often implicitly define urbanism in terms of commercial diversity at the expense of the reasons why many people prefer to live in small cities: proximity to kin or nature, and the fact that most big-city pleasures can be found everywhere.

Second, we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found. Our analysis aims to help the design of better tools in two ways: (i) by identifying how, through a well-established model of self-regulation, current tools overlap and differ in how they support self-control; and (ii) by using the model to reveal underexplored cognitive mechanisms that could aid the design of new tools.",TRUE,FALSE,addiction|attention|digital wellbeing|distraction|focus|human-computer interaction|ICT non-use|interruptions|self-control|self-regulation,2019-02-14T15:58:03.972154,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-14T15:57:47.474004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/citation/,685tm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zyj4h/,zyj4h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c51df42bf723100197c5e89/,5c51df42bf723100197c5e89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/685tm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/685tm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/685tm,https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300361

Modern packages for persistent homology often construct Vietoris–Rips or other distance-based simplicial complexes on point clouds because they are relatively easy to compute. We investigate alternative methods of constructing these complexes and the effects of making associated choices during simplicial-complex construction on the output of persistent-homology algorithms. We present two new methods for constructing simplicial complexes from two-dimensional geospatial data (such as maps). We apply these methods to a California precinct-level voting data set, demonstrating that our new constructions can capture geometric characteristics that are missed by distance-based constructions. Our new constructions can thus yield more interpretable persistence modules and barcodes for geospatial data. In particular, they are able to distinguish short-persistence features that occur only for a narrow range of distance scales (e.g., voting behaviors in densely populated cities) from short-persistence noise by incorporating information about other spatial relationships between precincts.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|elections|geospatial data|persistent homology|topological data analysis|voting,2019-01-30T15:57:02.062932,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-30T15:56:01.388626,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/citation/,9mbdn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5111d8568329001b842b7f/,5c5111d8568329001b842b7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9mbdn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9mbdn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9mbdn,NA

Immigration, Adolescent Language Aptitude and New Evidence on Books in the Home from Four European Countries","Evidence suggests that books in the childhood home impacts children’s educational and occupational attainments. Previous research finds this ‘book effect’ after conditioning on parental socio-economic status and national context. Human and cultural capital theories offer plausible explanations for this book effect. However, mechanisms underlying the book effect remain empirically illusory. Drawing on previous findings, we develop theoretical arguments that human and cultural capital are not the entire story behind the book effect. Designing a formal model of all these processes, we test our claims using immigration, language and country-context to adjudicate between mechanisms hypothesized by the theories. Using CILS4EU data in four countries and structural equation modeling to test these theories’ models against the data, we find the direct effect of books does not differ between native and immigrant adolescents in predicting 9th grade language aptitude scores. Moreover, this effect does not vary much by country. Reading habits and primary language spoken at home explain only part of the effect suggesting the presence of books measures something operating independently and in addition to human and cultural capital.

States with the biggest increases were Florida, New York and Pennsylvania, and there were disproportionately larger increases in the 15-30 age groups and for men compared to women. Additionally, we find evidence of subsequent return migration to Puerto Rico over the period January 2018 to March 2018. These results illustrate the power of complementing social media and traditional data to monitor demographic indicators over time, particularly after a shock, such as a natural disaster, to understand large changes in population characteristics.",TRUE,FALSE,Facebook data|Hurricane Maria|Migration|Puerto Rico,2019-01-28T23:10:21.675386,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-28T23:07:09.731381,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/citation/,39s6c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dnxu2/,dnxu2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4f53690d1c9e001a4cb667/,5c4f53690d1c9e001a4cb667,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/39s6c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/39s6c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/39s6c,https://doi.org/10.1111/padr.12289

Starting in the 1950s, various traditions in economics purported to explain the concept of “inflation inertia”. Contributions ranging from Celso Furtado and M.H. Simonsen to James Tobin anticipated key aspects of what later became the inertial inflation hypothesis, building it into either mathematical or conceptual frameworks compatible with the then contemporaneous macroeconomic theory. In doing so, they bridged the analytical gap with the North-American developments whilst maintaining the key features of the CEPAL approach, such as distributional conflicts and local institutional details. These contributions eventually influenced the second moment of the monetarist-structuralist controversy that unraveled in the 1980s. The paper also highlights how later works by structuralist economists gradually stripped the inertial inflation approach of its previous substance and form, thereby unearthing tensions among Latin-American structuralists that led to the eventual decline of this research program.",TRUE,FALSE,|Celso Furtado|inertial inflation|James Tobin|Latin America stabilization,2019-01-28T23:06:41.750236,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-28T23:06:09.924582,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,History of Economics Society,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/citation/,gxy4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4f0875bf723100197a642b/,5c4f0875bf723100197a642b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gxy4n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gxy4n,NA
