This paper focuses on rural north India, where despite robust economic growth and government subsidies, seven out of eight households mainly use solid fuels. We draw on new qualitative and quantitative data, and a recent policy environment that dramatically expanded ownership of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), to examine why households are slow to adopt clean fuels in rural north India. We find that patriarchal gender norms and attitudes encourage the use of solid fuels in this region. North Indian society confers low status to women, promotes women's seclusion, and constrains women's engagement in economic activities outside of the home. These beliefs encourage women to preserve gas, promote women's work that facilitates the use of solid fuels, and hinder communication between the cook and the decision-maker regarding LPG refills. When rural north Indian households use gas, it is frequently to facilitate the adherence to norms of seclusion that prevent women from leaving the home to collect solid fuels. Future research and policy interventions should pay careful attention to the gender norms and attitudes that discourage the use of gas. Addressing these beliefs is essential to sustained LPG use and health improvements.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-21T04:04:05.474407,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-21T04:03:21.893843,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://riceinstitute.org/data/2014-and-2018-rural-sanitation-surveys/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",Sangita Vyas|Aashish Gupta|Nazar Khalid,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/citation/,3v4cj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f67f4029e9a3d007e6e5ba2/,5f67f4029e9a3d007e6e5ba2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v4cj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3v4cj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3v4cj,NA

Methods: We assessed the effectiveness of SAO initiative in reducing crime and gun violence using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. Results: Results indicate the SAO initiative was only associated with significant reductions in specific property offenses, not violent crime rates. Foot patrols did not have a strong, isolating impact on violent street crime in 2014 or 2015. Deployments on foot across expansive geographies also has a weak, negligible influence on open-air shootings. Conclusions: The findings suggest saturating jurisdictions with high-visibility foot patrols has little influence on street-level offending, with no anticipatory or persistent effects. Police departments should exercise caution in deploying foot patrols over large patrol jurisdictions.",TRUE,FALSE,Deterrence|Difference-in-differences|Foot patrol|New York City|Policing,2020-09-20T01:33:22.237464,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-20T01:33:02.625203,TRUE,Mr. Thomas J.

Our main findings are the following. The secondary effects of social origins – their effects via the educational choices that young people make given their prior academic performance – are clearly operative across five key educational transitions within the English educational system. More specifically, we estimate that 35% of the total effect of social origins is secondary in the earliest transition we consider, and from 15-20% in the subsequent four. Further, mediation analyses reveal that secondary effects are most strongly associated with parental education and then to a lesser degree with parental status, while little association exists with parental class and none at all with parental income. Primary effects are also at all transitions most strongly associated with parental education and status but in this case both parental class and parental income do retain some importance. Finally, secondary effects on educational transitions appear to be top-driven. There is a clear tendency for their importance to be greater in the case of young people with highly educated, professional parents as compared with those of all other social backgrounds. We suggest an explanation for our empirical findings as resulting largely from the concern of such parents and their children to avoid the occurrence of downward intergenerational mobility, especially in terms of education and status.",TRUE,FALSE,educational inequality|primary and secondary effects|social mobility|social origins,2020-09-20T01:29:41.865181,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-20T01:29:27.392841,FALSE,NA,no,The data used in this study are available from the UK Data Archive but only through a secure access licence specifically assigned to this project.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/citation/,chvz7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f66083746080900341b347e/,5f66083746080900341b347e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/chvz7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/chvz7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/chvz7,NA

This study models and analyzes the street networks of every urban area in the world, using boundaries derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. Street network data are acquired and modeled from OpenStreetMap with the open‐source OSMnx software. In total, this study models over 160 million OpenStreetMap street network nodes and over 320 million edges across 8,914 urban areas in 178 countries, and attaches elevation and grade data. This article presents the study’s reproducible computational workflow, introduces two new open data repositories of ready‐to‐use global street network models and calculated indicators, and discusses summary findings on street network form worldwide. It makes four contributions. First, it reports the methodological advances of this open‐source workflow. Second, it produces an open data repository containing street network models for each urban area. Third, it analyzes these models to produce an open data repository containing street network form indicators for each urban area.

Using administration records - marriage certificates and applications - gathered from settings representing a variety of COVID-19 experiences in the United States, we compare counts of recorded marriages in 2020 against those from the same period in 2019. We find a dramatic decrease in year-to-date cumulative marriages in 2020 compared to 2019 in each case. Similar patterns are observed for the Seattle metropolitan area when we analyze the cumulative number of marriage applications, a leading indicator of marriages in the near future. Year-to-date declines in marriage are unlikely to be solely due to closure of government agencies that administer marriage certification or reporting delays. Together, these findings suggest marriage has declined during the COVID-19 outbreak and may continue to do so, at least in the short term.",TRUE,FALSE,administrative data|COVID-19|marriage|pandemic|United States,2020-09-18T21:41:01.238573,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-18T21:40:41.580862,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/v8hxs/?view_only=e07fc26879e64fa29f48aa48ac35d804,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/citation/,x6ph4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v8hxs/,v8hxs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f64fad39e9a3d00196e374c/,5f64fad39e9a3d00196e374c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x6ph4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x6ph4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x6ph4,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023120980328

Democracy­ building is a common tool in counterinsurgencies and post­ conflict states, yet existing scholarship has faced obstacles in measuring the independent effect of democratic reforms. We evaluate whether quotas for Scheduled Tribes in local councils reduced rebel violence in Chhattisgarh, an Indian state featuring high­ intensity Maoist insurgent activity. We employ a geographic regression discontinuity design to study the effects of identical quotas implemented in Chhattisgarh, finding that reservations reduced Maoist violence in the state. Exploratory analyses of mechanisms suggest that reservations reduced violence by bringing local elected officials closer to state security forces, providing a windfall of valuable information to counterinsurgents. Our study shows that institutional engineering and inclusive representative democracy, in particular, can shape the trajectory of insurgent violence.",TRUE,FALSE,Counterinsurgency|India|Naxalites|Quotas|Regression Discontinuity,2020-09-18T21:40:00.767490,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-18T21:39:37.999880,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available after publication!,,no,,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Peace and Conflict",Aidan Milliff and Drew Stommes,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/citation/,gfh3m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f64f9329e9a3d00186e2bbf/,5f64f9329e9a3d00186e2bbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfh3m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gfh3m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gfh3m,NA

To explain the use of these innovation practices, extant research has focused on enabling conditions at the individual and organizational level, but has paid little attention to extra-organizational factors such as culture. To address this gap, we adopted a field framing perspective to study the use of open innovation practices in the New York City (NYC) administration. We found that actors in NYC equipped different social positions – insider, outsider, and interstitial – and used different discursive tactics – reflective frame blending and supplemental frame blending – to enhance the cultural resonance of open innovation practices. We further theorize these findings with a framework on the enabling conditions for the cultural resonance of innovation practices. Our study contributes to innovation studies by unpacking the role of culture for the use of innovation practices and to the framing literature by specifying the role of discursive tactics and social positions for the cultural resonance of new practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Culture|Discourse|Frames|Framing|Issue field|Open innovation|Organizational practice|Public sector innovation,2020-09-20T01:28:00.713699,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-20T01:27:48.871910,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/citation/,zbvs6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f64daa557f28c0051134f81/,5f64daa557f28c0051134f81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zbvs6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zbvs6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zbvs6,https://doi.org/10.1080/14479338.2018.1514259
