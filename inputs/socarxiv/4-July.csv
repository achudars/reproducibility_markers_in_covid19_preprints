In this paper we formalise the features of ``liquid democracy'' which allows voters to delegate their votes to other voters, and we explore whether it improves information aggregation as compared to direct voting. We consider a two-alternative setup with truth-seeking voters (informed and uninformed) and partisan ones (leftists and rightists), and we show that delegation improves information aggregation in finite elections. We also propose a mechanism that further improves the information aggregation properties of delegation in private information settings, by guaranteeing that all vote transfers are from uninformed to informed truth-seeking voters. Delegation offers effective ways for truth-seeking uninformed voters to boost the vote-share of the alternative that matches the state of the world in all considered setups and hence deserves policy makers' attention.",TRUE,FALSE,abstention|Condorcet Jury theorem|delegation|experts|information aggregation|liquid democracy|majority voting|partisans,2021-07-08T08:50:26.460352,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T08:50:00.701845,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,The Authors (NOTE: previous OSF arxiv version: https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2Fvt2m5%2Fdownload),2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/citation/,ubk7p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rz2pt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/relationships/node/,rz2pt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e59514924b40003f4ee30d/,60e59514924b40003f4ee30d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubk7p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ubk7p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ubk7p,NA

This paper considers and compares two (sets of) coming out videos on YouTube from the Rhodes brothers in the United States and the Huang brothers in Taiwan that both became landmark social media and mass media events. It questions the normative narrative of coming out and the uneven flows of youth cultures and celebrity cultures online, where the visibility of certain social groups has masked the invisibility of other marginalized people. The critique extends to the “YouTube celebrity economy” and video-based female queer fandom, as well as the parents’ responses and reactions to their children’s coming out that have been recorded on video—an important part of coming out that is often overlooked in queer studies and youth studies. This paper offers a unique lens that connects online stardom and fandom to parental responses to coming out, shedding further light on global youth cultures, YouTube economy and queer celebrities, and parent-youth relations in Asia and America.",TRUE,FALSE,Celebrity Culture and Female Fandom|Coming Out|Parental Response to Coming Out|Queer Youths|Taiwan and United States,2021-07-08T08:48:02.270440,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T08:47:41.932105,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c9a|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c9c|Arts and Humanities|American Studies|American Popular Culture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0a|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d0b|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies|Chinese Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/citation/,zj5sv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e58838924b40003f4ed566/,60e58838924b40003f4ed566,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zj5sv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zj5sv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zj5sv,https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2021.1950797

However, making processes open will not per se drive wide re-use or participation unless also accompanied by the capacity (in terms of knowledge, skills, financial resources, technological readiness and motivation) to do so. These capacities vary considerably across regions, institutions and demographics. Those advantaged by such factors will remain potentially privileged, putting Open Science’s agenda of inclusivity at risk of propagating conditions of “cumulative advantage”. With this paper, we systematically scope existing research addressing the question: “What evidence and discourse exists in the literature about the ways in which dynamics and structures of inequality could persist or be exacerbated in the transition to Open Science, across disciplines, regions and demographics?” Aiming to synthesise findings, identify gaps in the literature, and inform future research and policy, our results identify threats to equity associated with all aspects of Open Science, including Open Access, Open/FAIR Data, Open Methods, Open Evaluation, Citizen Science, as well as its interfaces with society, industry and policy. Key threats include: stratifications of publishing due to the exclusionary nature of the author-pays model of Open Access; potential widening of the digital divide due to the infrastructure-dependent, highly situated nature of open data practices; risks of diminishing qualitative methodologies as “reproducibility” becomes synonymous with quality; new risks of bias and exclusion in means of transparent evaluation; and crucial asymmetries in the Open Science relationships with industry and the public, which privileges the former and fails to fully include the latter.",TRUE,FALSE,equity|open science,2021-07-08T04:52:29.441293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T04:52:05.934145,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4936203,available,NA,https://osf.io/t6uy9/,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/citation/,d5fz7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e56e3af80fdb003f4dc1f3/,60e56e3af80fdb003f4dc1f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5fz7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d5fz7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d5fz7,NA

From a UK perspective, reviewed literature confirms that there is a deep divide in the factors causing a person’s employment to be affected by the pandemic, with educational attainment, household income and age all having a role. Food insecurity has been increasing rapidly in recent years in the UK, and the literature confirms exacerbated levels of food insecurity coming as a result of the pandemic. The present study seeks to understand the variables influencing two research questions, firstly which factors will affect the likelihood of being ‘furloughed’ (under the government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme) or otherwise being required to reduce one’s working hours, and secondly the factors that may cause someone to experience food insecurity in the pandemic. Key findings are that having young children, being self-employed and having a higher household income are all factors that may make it more likely that one will lose hours in their job or be furloughed. Conversely, being a keyworker and having higher educational qualifications are shown to reduce the likelihood of reducing job hours. Food insecurity is made more likely by being from an ethnic minority background, having young children and being a lower earner.",TRUE,FALSE,children|cjrs|coronavirus|covid19|covid-19|dissertation|education|furlough|gender|income|inequality|keyworker|logistic|mentalhealth|mental health|pandemic|regression|sociology|uk|undergraduate|united kingdom|working,2021-07-08T08:49:24.269908,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T08:48:59.514199,FALSE,NA,no,"The data (Understanding Society COVID-19 Study) is available at the UK Data Service through the following link: http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8644-9.

This presents an opportunity to align development with the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’s (GBF) ambition for overall biodiversity recovery. In this perspective, we describe three conditions that should be accounted for in establishing or revising net gain policies to align their outcomes with the Post-2020 GBF: namely, a requirement for residual losses from development to be compensated for by (1) absolute gains, which are (2) scaled to the achievement of explicit biodiversity targets, where (3) gains are ecologically feasible. We show that few current policies meet these conditions, and thus we demonstrate a major disconnect between existing biodiversity net gain approaches and the achievement of the Post-2020 GBF milestones and goals.

Indonesia has more than 4000 higher education institutions that are building quality to educate the nation’s life. But only a few of these managed to become centers of excellence. There has been a widening quality gap between universities in Java and outside Java. Without radical policies in the higher education sector, the future of the young generation will be threatened.

We argue that while class has sometimes been taken as a proxy for long-term earning levels, it is of greater importance, at least when treated in terms of the EGP schema or the European Socio-Economic Classification (ESEC), in capturing differences in the trajectories that employees’ earnings follow over the course of their working lives. Moving beyond previous single country studies, we examine how far the theory that underlies ESEC is reflected in men’s age-earnings trajectories across 14 European countries, while also taking into account any effects of their educational qualifications. Modelling data from the 2017 EU-SILC survey, and focussing on men’s full year/full-time equivalent gross annual earnings, we find that although the age-earnings trajectories that are estimated for different classes do reveal some cross-national variation, there are major features, of a theoretically expected kind, that are evident with our pooled sample and that regularly recur in individual countries. Class differences in earnings are at their narrowest for men in the youngest age group but then widen across older age groups. This occurs primarily because the earnings of men in the professional and managerial salariat, and especially in the higher salariat, show a marked rise with age, while the earnings of men in other classes rise far less sharply or remain flat. We also find evidence that these diverging trajectories are primarily shaped by individuals’ class positions independently of their level of qualifications – however important the latter is in determining the class positions that they hold. What can be regarded as the logic of different forms of employment relations, as captured by ESEC, leads to a large degree of cross-national commonality in the association that exists between class and the trajectories of earnings over working life.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-07-08T04:47:25.648930,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T04:46:54.565848,FALSE,NA,no,The micro-data used in this paper (EU-SILC) are only available via a special licence.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/citation/,ykf5z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e47d79f83de20419b0305e/,60e47d79f83de20419b0305e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykf5z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ykf5z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ykf5z,NA

The work documents a substantial rise in the total value of inheritance and gifts as a share of national income, from 8.4% in 1995 to 15.1% in 2016. Consistent with the increasing role of total personal net wealth in the economy, the weight of inheritance and gifts in Italy appears relatively high by international standards. Over the same period, total wealth left at death has also become increasingly concentrated. The estates valued at least €1 million were worth 18.7% of total estate in the mid 1990s and 24.8% in 2016. This paper also documents that revenues collected from the inheritance tax underwent a threefold decline from 0.15% to 0.05% of total tax revenue between 1995 and 2016. Data also allow a disaggregated analysis by demographic and geographic characteristics.
