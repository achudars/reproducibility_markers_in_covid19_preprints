In the Indian context, the question remains is that “is the online medium inclusive enough to be deemed a solution?” As classes shift online and pedagogy relies on technology, it becomes imperative to ensure that no one lags behind and education remains accessible to the last learner. The issue of universality of the access to the Internet in India mingles with various socio-economic disparities that hinder its progress.

The main research question of the study is how generational differences between Arabizi users shape their experiences with Arabizi in terms of 1) how they learned it, 2) how they currently use it, 3) how they perceive its effect on the Arabic language, 4) their attitude towards its users, 5) and their expectations for its future use. Semi-structured interviews were employed to gain a deeper insight into participants’ experiences with Arabizi, taking into consideration their linguistic, educational, work, and social backgrounds. The significance of this case study lies in how Arabizi users’ surroundings and life experiences influence their linguistic choices and perceptions. Findings provide insight into how Arabizi is considered advantageous compared to using English language. It is also perceived to be a phase for youngsters that will subside in the future as technology develops.

These novels are selected because the latter appropriates the creator and creature characters and contextualizes them into the American-Iraq 2005 post-war period. In Shelley’s Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein, scientifically, gives life to a dead body amalgamated from other body parts, which start murdering and revenging upon his creator. Whereas, in Saadawi’s twenty-first century Frankenstein, a person who is formed from others’ dead bodies by merely a junk dealer, starts murdering and revenging upon other people. On the one hand, Frankenstein, a science student, sought to answer the question of human revival theoretically and practically. Therefore, after he resurrects the dead, it becomes monstrous due to its negligence and physical hideousness by its creator. On the other hand, the Iraqi Frankenstein’s creator, Hadi, celebrates collecting old materials in a non-scientific manner, including humans’ dead body parts, in order to give value to them by offering them worthy of proper burials. The resurrected creatures transform into more powerful beings than their creators as reactions against isolation and injustice. For that, both Frankenstein and Hadi lose control over their creations, who instigate new life cycles. Hence, the ethical responsibility of invention underlies the concept of innocence which this paper intends to analyze vis-à-vis the creators and their creations.",TRUE,FALSE,Ahmed Saadawi|Baghdad|Frankenstein in Baghdad|innocence|Shelley|Victor Frankenstein,2021-06-18T06:54:45.749242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:54:30.614105,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/citation/,dw45y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cc08856bd0d1001626e6aa/,60cc08856bd0d1001626e6aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dw45y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dw45y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dw45y,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no2.10

Freud’s division of the human psyche into the three components of id, ego and superego is applicable to the analysis of the rise and fall of the hero in his quest for Estella’s love. Four main questions have been dealt with: First, what makes up Pip’s id when it comes to love? Second, what are the main components of his superego that stand in the way of his love? Third, does Pip’s ego succeed in striking a balance between his id and superego? In what ways does it fail? And fourth, how does it eventually succeed if ever? The study has managed to answer its key research questions: First, Pip’s id is illustrated in the feelings and actions exerts in order to win Estella’s love.  Second, Pip’s superego is mainly made up of the attitudes of characters that stand in his way. Third, Pip’s distress at the attitudes of Estella, Miss Havisham, Biddy and his friends, bring Pip’s ego to its worst situation.

Therefore, translators should approach advertisements unequally in a particular culture. The translation of advertisement has gradually expanded as a result of the rise of globalization and trade intensification, and that necessitated that companies communicate with consumers of different cultures.The present study aims at investigating how sociocultural variables which play a vital role in advertisement are dealt with cross-linguistically. It first introduces a theoretical background that discusses the concept of culture and its impact on translation, as well as the major translation strategies used to deal with cultural issues. It, moreover, attempts to answer the question about how cultural variables affect the process of translation and the selection of an appropriate equivalent. To answer this question, seven ads, along with their translations, have been selected and subjected to a thorough analysis. The article comes up with some conclusions, the most important of which are: cultural domination plays a more pivotal role in translating ads than in other text types, that the translation strategies used for rendering an ad between English and Arabic range from literal translation to rewriting, with free translation to be of a higher frequency, that specific translation methods, such as transliteration, have been overused. Finally, the study has shown a growing tendency in Arabic to depart the traditional cultural aspects of writing and translating an ad and move towards those of the English-speaking culture.",TRUE,FALSE,advertisements|Arabic-English-Arabic Translation|cultural diversity|cultural domination|translation strategies,2021-06-18T06:55:20.773691,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:55:03.389113,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/citation/,85u37,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cc05e86bd0d1001526be99/,60cc05e86bd0d1001526be99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85u37/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/85u37/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/85u37,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no2.6

It breaks new ground in a new type of problems inherent in the translation of the Quran. It is designed to catch translators’ alert senses to look beyond the traditional approach to translation, i.e. looking for the superficial equivalent. It critically discusses the long-standing proclivity for the deeply-held belief in the existence of absolute synonyms in the Quran. Although the examples given are not very exhaustive due to space constraints, the author’s unbridled reason pushes him to how far semantic propinquity exists in the Quran, developing a plethora of new checklists which will definitely act as a springboard to lay groundwork to any translator. The paper draws a conclusion that the seemingly verb and noun synonyms in the Quran are not so, resulting in a lexical asymmetry in translation. This paper zooms in on a new type of sense relationships, which involve a pair of words with similar meaning, but are made up of the same root morphologically. The paper takes three very popular and mesmerizing translations of the Quran as a point of reference. This paper shatters the fervent belief that one word can be a full equivalent to seemingly synonymous words in the Quran.

Caught between the authority of tradition and the sensitivity of translating a sacred text, many translators refrain from practicing interpretation as an integral part of the translation process, whereas others defiantly dismiss the authority of tradition en masse. The significance of the study lies in undermining over-reliance on explanatory texts yields semantically dogmatic interpretations recurrently manifest in the various English renditions of the Qurʾan. The article questions what is called the etic translation that involves translation from the perspective of one who remains an outsider and does not participate in the interpretation. The finding of the study lead to the conclusion that many translations of the Qurʾan disregard possible interpretations because of rehashing interpretations handed down from traditional exegeses. The article also argues that translators have an active, interpretative role in the translation of the Qurʾan. Compatibility with tradition does not mean being constricted exclusively by Tafsīr.

There are many examples in Greek and Arab literature where poetry is believed to have connections with divinity, possession, or even madness. The paper will try to show what Greeks and Arabs thought about the origin and the creation of poetry. It will attempt to show how early mythology and legends of both assign a supernatural or abnormal source to poetry.

There, women are bound to doing housework and rearing children; they are a mere tool to meet their husbands’ pleasures and find concubines when needed. Accordingly, the study examines the sources , and types of psychological trauma experienced by the character O-lan, and later by the oppressors, her husband and his new wife, Wang Lung , in Buck’s novel The Good Earth. To meet the objective of the study, Robinson, Smith, &amp; Segal’s (2020) types of trauma will be adopted in the analysis. Such a study help know more about the traditions and values of Chinese society, the role of women there. It further reflects the negative societal consequence s of abusing and humiliating women, and the curse men will gain due to their unjust treatment of their wives. The psychological trauma of O-lan is highly indicated by her husband’s speech and behavior. He constantly belittles her role a wife, neglecting her emotions. She keeps her agony and depression till she collapsed.",TRUE,FALSE,Buck’s novel the Good Earth|Chinese society|embodied oppression|psychological Trauma,2021-06-18T06:56:02.451360,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:55:45.381184,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/citation/,rneut,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cc00f86bd0d1001626c6d2/,60cc00f86bd0d1001626c6d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rneut/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rneut/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rneut,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no2.8

Challenges in a patriarchal society among female poets in the early ages and before the twenty-first century deserve appreciation for their contributions to early feminist literature. The author will illustrate how Jemmat negotiated her ambitions despite the cultural restrictions that were placed upon her during the 18th century through a rural persona. Jemmat skillfully creates a light-hearted poem, but also one that reflects the determined voice of a speaker who refuses to allow others to dictate her life. Jemmat seems to achieve this in The Rural Lass, as she subtly challenges the parental and societal objections that could often, as in Jemmat’s case, prevent the marriage of a loving couple. This article will study through the feminist literary criticism, that closer analysis of the variations within the metrical composition and of the poetic features in The Rural Lass shows that a deeper level of meaning can be achieved. The structured reasoning ensures that the rural lass appears rational and justly defiant. This paper also explores how a close study of the text allows for the emergence of the admirable spirit of the figure of the rural lass that expresses challenges in a patriarchal society, an eighteenth-century British feminist that has been criticized by her community.",TRUE,FALSE,18th -century poetry|Catherine Jemmat|feminism|Patriarchal Society|poetic features|The Rural Lass|urban phenomena,2021-06-18T06:56:26.403056,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-18T06:55:55.356253,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/citation/,58c2q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cc0003d6bcbc000d08ed46/,60cc0003d6bcbc000d08ed46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58c2q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58c2q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58c2q,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol5no2.5
