This paper empirically examines the 17 U.S.C. § 512 notice and takedown 
process as implemented by the Texas online service provider, The Planet. 
We reviewed a random sample of notices from a population of all notices 
processed by The Planet from August 2004 to June 2007. We used a mixed 
methodology, qualitatively assessing the notices, and running 
quantitative checks to ensure that we were not mistakenly over- or 
understating the importance of qualitative findings. Because the notices 
most clearly show sender behavior, we focus on senders’ use of section 
512; we then more generally discuss the possible effects of sender 
behavior on targets and OSPs. We conclude that section 512 continues to 
be useful for copyright holders; in addition, it undoubtedly provides 
important innovation-promoting protection for intermediaries. Yet the 
section 512 regime also shows serious strain in practice, at least 
within our observed set of notices. A considerable group of senders have 
difficulty following section 512’s technical requirements and 
understanding the substantive underlying copyright law. Further, as 
expected, the large copyright industries appear to be challenged by 
peer-to-peer filesharing — a problem for which the notice and takedown 
framework does not provide immediate relief — leading them to make 
broader demands than are supported by section 512. Finally, the emerging 
dominance of third-party rights enforcement organizations (""REOs"") and 
trade associations, which have incentives to generate notices and 
achieve takedowns, add a layer of complexity to the process. Ultimately, 
these strains, and senders’ responses to them, likely affect both OSPs 
and targets. Overall, they prompt concerns about due process for targets 
and potential harms to Internet expression. We reaffirm our previous 
suggestions for reform, and call for greater information sharing and 
transparency to help rebalance and strengthen the section 512 process.

Fueled by recent public and private efforts to improve access to 
scholarly works, academic libraries and archives are increasingly 
digitizing their special collections and creating online repositories 
for scholarly works. This enhanced online presence has increased 
libraries’ exposure to takedown requests from rightsholders and other 
concerned parties. Using survey questions and interviews, we examined 
academic libraries’ interaction with both Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act (“DMCA”) and non-DMCA takedown notices. We found that academic 
libraries most commonly receive non-DMCA takedown requests that are 
based on non-copyright issues (such as privacy) or that target materials 
the library itself has placed online. In general, libraries have 
well-developed norms and practices in place to manage these types of 
requests to remove material. We also found, however, that formal DMCA 
notices directed to libraries have historically been rare, but that this 
may be changing as open access repositories hosted by libraries grow. In 
tracing the recent experience of academic libraries that have received 
DMCA takedown notices targeting material in their open access 
repositories, we found that libraries have not yet developed norms and 
practices for addressing these requests. We discuss why this might be, 
and suggest steps libraries, publishers, and authors can take to best 
manage copyright conflicts while supporting libraries’ missions to 
preserve and provide access to knowledge.

This chapter serves as an introduction to the privacy and security 
issues presented by advanced metering and other ""smart grid"" 
technologies, and to recent policy efforts to address them. The chapter 
introduces the recent political and economic push to move to the ‘smart 
grid’, describes the privacy issues presented by advanced metering 
technologies and the data they gather, and gives an overview of 
regulatory and policy efforts being made to address them as the smart 
grid develops.

Smart electricity meters and other devices that gather or process 
household energy signatures at high temporal resolutions hold a great 
deal of promise. Among other predicted benefits, smart grid technologies 
are expected to better manage energy usage, enable real-time 
demand-response pricing, improve efficient load balancing across the 
grid, and increase the capacity for solar and other edge-based energy 
generation. These predicted benefits depend, in part, on new, richer 
data models of energy flow and usage. The temporally granular data 
collected by advanced metering technologies can reveal detailed 
information about intimate life within the home, raising serious 
questions about how to address privacy interests. Moreover, the present 
vision for the smart grid requires large numbers of new devices and 
gateways to connect from the ‘edge’ of the grid, raising security issues 
that require immediate and sustained attention. Recent and ongoing 
technical and policy efforts in the United States and elsewhere attempt 
to address these issues.

Agents can be empowered voluntarily, with copyright holders opting in to permit licensing of their works, or they can be established or empowered by statute. Collective licensing has been suggested as a possible solution for the obstacle copyright law places in the path of new uses of works enabled by innovative technologies. Collective licensing does have the potential to reduce transaction costs when a large number of works are licensed to a large number of users, thereby benefiting both rightsholders and users. However, the track record of collective organizations (CROs), the entities that manage collective licenses, reveals that they often fail to live up to that potential. Although there are a wide variety of CROs operating under divergent legal frameworks, many unfortunately share the characteristic of serving their own interests at the expense of artists and the public. In discussions of copyright policy, lawmakers generally consider two broad stakeholder groups: authors on the one hand and the general public on the other.

Because of the unique factual context of the case, it stops short of bridging the gap between educational fair use and modern transformative use jurisprudence. With help from recent scholarship on broad patterns in fair use case law, I pick up where the GSU court left off, describing a variety of common educational uses that are categorizable as transformative, and, therefore, entitled to broad deference under contemporary fair use doctrine.

*Abstract:*

It has been nearly twenty years since section 512 of the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act established the so-called notice and takedown 
process. Despite its importance to copyright holders, online service 
providers, and Internet speakers, very little empirical research has 
been done on how effective section 512 is for addressing copyright 
infringement, spurring online service provider development, or providing 
due process for notice targets.

This report includes three studies that draw back the curtain on notice 
and takedown:

1. using detailed surveys and interviews with more than three dozen 
respondents, the first study gathers information on how online service 
providers and rightsholders experience and practice notice and takedown 
on a day-to-day basis;

2. the second study examines a random sample from over 100 million 
notices generated during a six-month period to see who is sending 
notices, why, and whether they are valid takedown requests; and

3. the third study looks specifically at a subset of those notices that 
were sent to Google Image Search.

The findings suggest that whether notice and takedown “works” is highly 
dependent on who is using it and how it is practiced, though all 
respondents agreed that the Section 512 safe harbors remain fundamental 
to the online ecosystem. Perhaps surprisingly in light of large-scale 
online infringement, a large portion of OSPs still receive relatively 
few notices and process them by hand. For some major players, however, 
the scale of online infringement has led to automated, “bot”-based 
systems that leave little room for human review or discretion, and in a 
few cases notice and takedown has been abandoned in favor of techniques 
such as content filtering. The second and third studies revealed 
surprisingly high percentages of notices of questionable validity, with 
mistakes made by both “bots” and humans.

The findings strongly suggest that the notice and takedown system is 
important, under strain, and that there is no “one size fits all” 
approach to improving it. Based on the findings, we suggest a variety of 
reforms to law and practice.

Note: This is an updated version of the original paper. It includes two new appendices and some minor updates and corrections.

thereof) of scholarship and information access. We examine some of the cultural biases inherent in both library
classification systems and newer forms of information access like Google search algorithms, and propose ways of
recognizing bias and applying feminist principles in the design of information services for scholars, particularly as libraries
reinvent
themselves to grapple with digital collections.",TRUE,FALSE,code4lib|critlib|feminist HCI|information sciences|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:49.143603,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T14:16:47.262000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/citation/,wq8va,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2a4kz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/relationships/node/,2a4kz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5788f0519ad5a101f5f5c2e9/,5788f0519ad5a101f5f5c2e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wq8va/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wq8va/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wq8va

an authentic musical form within the restricted field of cultural production. First, this paper
outlines how fields of cultural production operate. Second, this paper illustrates how the data for
this project was collected. Third, this paper highlights how past and current struggles within the
field shape how authenticity is defined. Fourth, this paper highlights the discursive techniques
used by hip hop practitioners to position rap music as aesthetically superior to the commercially
successful genres of new wave laika, 'hip pop,' corporate American hip hop and Greek pop. Fifth,
I illustrate how hip hop practitioners use two competing processes of aesthetic legitimation: local
authentication and translocal authentication, within the restricted field of cultural production.
Finally, I conclude with some suggested avenues for future research.
