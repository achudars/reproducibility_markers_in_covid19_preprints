Therefore, the main objective of the dissertation is to provide a description of the progressivity expressions in the Hassawi dialect. These expressions denote several meanings: duration, contingent happenings, temporariness, incompletion of actions and, in some instances, they show a ‘temporal frame effect’. It is argued that there are 13 means that denote progressivity in the Hassawi Dialect. Four of them were found in the literature. There are lexical main verbs functioning as aspectual verbs that express continuation such as: the simple form that consists of the imperfective form of activity, accomplishment, frequency, and passive meaning verbs that occur in all tenses and it is used interchangeably with the other progressive constructions showing that there is no opposition between the simple form and the progressive form. In addition, the active participles ‘gaaᶜid/jaalis’ that mean ‘sitting, remaining, staying’ in all tenses, the perfective verbs ‘jalas/gaᶜad’ meaning ‘sat, stayed’and ‘tamm/ Zal’that mean ‘stay,remain.completed’ and ‘stay,reman,continue’, respectively,  in the past and the imperfective verbs ‘yagᶜid/yajils –iyZil/iytimm’ in the present and the future preceding the imperfective form of activity, accomplishment, frequency, and passive meaning verbs and in very few cases with the state and achievement verbs. On the other hand, there is also a prepositional phrase ‘fiᶜizz’ behaving aspectually and denoting progressivity in all tenses followed by activity, accomplishment, frequency and a few state verbal nouns. Additionally, there is the active participle of some translocative, activity and very few state verbs in affirmative sentences and with a lot of the activity, and accomplishment verbs in the negative sentences in the present, past and the future. The imperfective and the perfective means are normally negated by ‘maa’ and for the purpose of intensifying the same action or introducing another action, ‘mu’, its variants and the negative copula are used instead. The perfective ‘Zal/tamm’ is either preceded by the negation particle denoting a progressive reading or followed by the negation particle indicating two readings; habitual or progressive. The active participles and the prepositional phrase denoting progressivity are negated by the particle ‘mu’normally in the present tense and by ‘maa’ in the past and the future tenses. Finally, the progressive construction in Hassawi dialect shows clear evidence that support Anderson’s localistic theory which indicates that the notion of location and direction is involved in the different aspect expressions in many languages.  In one construction, a locative participle is used and in the other one, a locative prepositional phrase is used.",TRUE,FALSE,accomplishment|activity|contingent happenings|frequency|localistic theory|progressivity expressions,2018-07-02T11:09:32.573244,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-31T01:47:00.292203,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/citation/,udygv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s4uh8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/relationships/node/,s4uh8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a768819ad5a1025f818f56/,59a768819ad5a1025f818f56,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udygv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udygv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udygv,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.188

Previous work suggested that the relationship is due to education socializing students to the “official culture” of the United States. This study uses the World Values Survey and General Social Survey to further develop this theory and test whether it applies to Americans’ attitudes toward justifiable violence. I find that Americans with more education are less likely to say that interpersonal violence—against women, children, and other individuals—can be justifiable. However, they are more likely to say that state-sanctioned violence—war and police violence—can be justifiable. These patterns are consistent with a modified socialization model of education and social attitudes. I conclude that American education socializes people to establishment culture, identity, and interests, which differentiate between unacceptable interpersonal violence and ostensibly acceptable state-sanctioned violence.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes|Corporal Punishment|Education|Family Violence|Interpersonal Violence|Intimate Partner Violence|Police Brutality|Violence|War,2018-07-02T11:09:32.385729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-30T18:57:16.829549,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/citation/,hgjsr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8hzbm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/relationships/node/,8hzbm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a709fc9ad5a10256d7aa48/,59a709fc9ad5a10256d7aa48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hgjsr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hgjsr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hgjsr,NA

The vulnerability of coastal populations exposed to inundation will be greater for some sub-populations due to differences in their socio-demographic characteristics. Many climate risk and vulnerability assessments, however, model current populations against future environments. We advance sea-level rise risk assessments by dynamically modeling environmental change and socio-demographic change. We project three scenarios of inundation exposure due to future sea-level rise in coastal Georgia from 2010 to 2050. We align the sea-level rise projections with five population projection scenarios of socially vulnerable sub-populations via the Hamilton-Perry method and the theory of demographic metabolism. Our combined fast sea-level rise and middle population scenarios project a near doubling of the population exposed, and a more than five-fold increase for those at risk (i.e., residing in a census tract with high social vulnerability) and most at risk (i.e., high social vulnerability and high exposure) compared to the same estimate based on 2010 population data. Of vulnerable sub-populations, women had the largest absolute increase in exposure for all scenario combinations. The Hispanic/Latinx population’s exposure increased the largest proportionally under the fast and medium sea-level rise projections and elderly people’s (65+) under the slow sea-level rise scenario. Our findings suggest that for coastal areas experiencing rapid growth (or declines) in more socially vulnerable sub-populations, estimates based on current population data are likely to underestimate (or overestimate) the proportion of such groups’ risk to inundation from future sea-level rise.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|demographic metabolism|Georgia|risk assessment|sea-level rise|social vulnerability,2018-07-02T11:09:30.699070,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-29T20:13:54.723908,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/citation/,pkr75,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hw6yv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/relationships/node/,hw6yv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a5c9d66c613b0258258325/,59a5c9d66c613b0258258325,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkr75/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pkr75/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pkr75,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.12.019

I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the relationship between prediction and explanation in sociological analyses.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|fragile families|grade-point average|machine learning|methodology|neural networks|predictive modeling,2018-07-02T11:09:30.213598,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-29T16:12:56.262996,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/citation/,7nsrf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yceg3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/relationships/node/,yceg3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a59196b83f69025c213714/,59a59196b83f69025c213714,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7nsrf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7nsrf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7nsrf,NA

In the proposed conceptual model, the aim of teaching is to form a learning organization: a knowledge community with emergent properties that cannot be reduced to any linear combination of the properties of its parts. In this approach, the learning of the participants depends not so much on their individual action, as on being the coevolving parts of a self-organized whole. In this design, the role of the educator is to catalyze emergence and to facilitate bottom-up knowledge production. To achieve this, we present a systematic way to orchestrate in-class face-to-face activities in small groups while utilizing common web technologies to facilitate online collective action.",TRUE,FALSE,blended learning|collaborative learning|complexity theory|complex systems|emergence|group work|learning|pedagogy|small groups|teaching,2018-07-02T11:09:26.709602,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-27T12:27:35.766972,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Counseling Psychology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/citation/,dwf59,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7gxq3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/relationships/node/,7gxq3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a2b12eb83f690258175228/,59a2b12eb83f690258175228,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dwf59/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dwf59/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dwf59,https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2017.1377506

Taking a cue from these debates, I explore attempts that aim to ‘slow down modernity’ by resisting the dynamic tempo of various social processes and experiences. The issue of slowdown now accounts for a largely unquestioned measure, expected to deliver unhasty tempo conditioning good and ethical life, mental well-being and accountable democracy. In principle, there is little to object to in such well-intended goals. This paper, nonetheless, identifies several problems associated with slowdown, especially if presented as an incontestable doctrine. Despite its progressive feel, slowdown also stands for 1) a capitalist commodity; 2) a dangerous political objective that weaves together parochialism with fear-driven social sentiment; and 3) an undesired subjective experience. Finally, I evaluate recent propositions around ‘accelerationism’ and ask whether they might tackle the pitfalls of both social acceleration and slowness. I conclude by arguing that neither slow nor fast can be preferred as universal solutions.",TRUE,FALSE,culture of slow|culture of speed|modernity|slow|slowness|social acceleration|social critique|sociology of time,2018-07-02T11:09:26.309817,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-27T05:32:37.033138,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",SAGE,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/citation/,xsthq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xk4s2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/relationships/node/,xk4s2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59a258aeb83f69025b17e32a/,59a258aeb83f69025b17e32a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsthq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xsthq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xsthq,NA
