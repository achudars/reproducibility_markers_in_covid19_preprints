The Consolidated Text of ACTA released in October 2010, following the final round of negotiations in Japan, contains no provision mandating the adoption of graduated response. Such regimes are tacitly endorsed in the agreement, however, through language in the preamble and the digital environment provisions concerning the promotion of greater cooperation between rights owners and service providers. Moreover, opponents of graduated response should be wary of the fact that public law mechanisms - be they domestic or international - are not the only means by which graduated response can effectively become the law for Internet users. The United States and Ireland provide examples of the trend toward private ordering in the project of online copyright enforcement.

Writing about the growth and governance of the Internet, David Post observed that ""scaling problems - the problems that arise solely as a consequence of increasing size or increasing numbers - can be profound, and profoundly difficult to solve."" Both the Internet's designers and the designers of P2P networks solved difficult problems of scale in their effort to revolutionize the distribution of information goods. In doing so, however, they created a problem of scale in the form of ""massive infringement."" How to approach solving that problem of scale is the subject of this article.

Part I traces the evolution of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks from Napster to BitTorrent, with a focus on the relative scalability of successive architectures. Part II takes up the difficult question of the scale of P2P infringement and its harms, examining the strategic number-crunching that underlies industry data on piracy, the government's credulous acceptance of that data, and the risk of letting industry hyperbole drive copyright policy and law enforcement priorities. Part III evaluates the efficacy of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a policy mechanism for scaling up online copyright enforcement. I argue in Part III that the DMCA has proven to be remarkably scalable for enforcing copyrights in hosted content but has altogether failed to scale in the context of P2P file sharing, leading to the dysfunctional workaround of mass John Doe litigation. Part IV weighs the costs and benefits of more scalable alternatives to mass litigation, including a potential amendment of the DMCA's pre-litigation subpoena provision and a pair of administrative dispute resolution systems - one hypothetical, the other real - for streamlining adjudication of P2P infringement claims.

It explores integrated thinking as a cultural control and analyses how it operates.

Methodology: To do so we conduct a case study of bankmecu, a small Australian bank, which is participating in the IIRC's <IR> Pilot Programme Business Network and which issued its first integrated report in 2012. Using semi-structured interviews we examine whether integrated thinking lives up to the rhetoric espoused by the IIRC.

Findings: In bankmecu's case we find that a pre-existing responsible banking culture already in place is a stronger cultural control, alongside personnel, results and action controls. The implication for the IIRC is that integrated thinking appears to be a utopian ideal, clashing with the existing organisational culture rather than driving a new organisational culture.

Practical implications: Additionally, if integrated thinking is to prevail it may become a source of inertia rather than change because it advocates that an entire workforce should think the same. We also question if breaking down silos, as advocated by integrated thinking, is necessary across all organisational functions, especially concerning material organisational risks and reputation, because these silos foster independent thinking.

Policy implications: The problem with the rhetorical arguments proposed by the IIRC is that they aim at a one size fits all approach. Not every organisation has a disconnection between strategy, governance, past performance and future prospects, nor do they all have disconnected departments that need reconnecting. Therefore, a fundamental problem with <IR> is that the rhetoric argues ""why"" companies need <IR>, not ""how"" to implement <IR>, and especially not ""how"" to operationalize integrated thinking.

Originality: The paper is a must read because of the growing debate on the benefits of Integrated Reporting by examining and critiquing early adopter's practice alongside the IIRC's rhetoric.

influential advocates of what anthropologist Lara Deeb has called
“authenticated Islam,” an approach to textual interpretation which stresses
the individual pursuit of religious knowledge and the conscious assent to
religious injunctions. This approach has dovetailed historically with an
increased interest in and concern with the intellectual legacies of Islam
on the part of ordinary Muslims, most of whom are living through the
postcolonial predicament of establishing the foundations of local political
order on the basis of structures of governance whose genealogy extends to
the European Enlightenment as well as to colonial legal regimes, local
practices, and even older imperial histories. Accordingly, the question of
what “Islamic civilization” has been or could be has gained political
urgency for many Muslim intellectuals since the formal independence of
Muslim-majority nation-states. The Center of Civilization for the
Development of Islamic Thought is a Beirut-based Shi’a Islamist publishing
house which has entered into this debate by putting forth a new view of
Islamic Civilization as a global, pan-Islamic endeavor by Muslim
intellectuals to facilitate interconfessional intellectual exchange. Led by
a reformist Lebanese cleric of Iranian heritage, Shaykh Yahya Mirzaei, the
Center’s employees hope their publishing will spur such intellectual
cooperation, leading to research-based Islamic political theory that

incontrovertibly the question of what cultural anthropology is—and what it
should be. De Castro places his combative cultural politics at the center
of the theory he builds; his declared cultural enemies are Western
modernity and science—more broadly, any ""mononaturalist"" episteme which
posits a shared, objectively knowable world. In opposition to these, he
advances a theory of ""perspectivism"" and ""multinaturalism"" which is
allegedly founded in part on Amerindian ""cosmophilosophy."" It bears
repeating, however, that the structural necessity of regional ontologies as
an inevitable outgrowth of the indeterminate trajectories of human
collectivities removed from each other at various degrees of distance does
not preclude at all an anthropology whose purpose is to build a universal
human understanding of culture and social life. This review was written
because the alternative, which has been gaining extraordinary appeal within

global environmental priority in the context of increasing amounts of waste
generated due to the development of a mass consumer society. Various issues
of waste management , territorial and temporal variability, spatial
analysis of treatment or disposal facilities, systemic implications on the
environment, the harmonization of international policy at national,
regional and local level are solid arguments for
studying this field by geography. Mostly technical or economic studies,
lacking a vision of territory are supplemented in the conceptual and
methodological level by geographers. This paper performed on the one hand,
an overview of various approaches in current literature on waste management
issue and on
another hand analyses the geographical contributions in this field. Our
conclusions lead to the idea that waste management must be performed
according to the geographical features of the territory concerned.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,engrxiv|environmental studies|geography|Preprint|socarxiv|sustainability|waste management,2018-07-02T10:48:32.613803,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T05:33:53.166000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/citation/,dkxcs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cyur8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/relationships/node/,cyur8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578b18c39ad5a101f8f5c506/,578b18c39ad5a101f8f5c506,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkxcs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dkxcs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dkxcs
