This appears to be neither empirically secure nor theoretically well-grounded. Using a newly constructed European dataset, we then aim to show that if mobility is treated in terms of social class, rather than income, an inverse relation with social inequality can be suggested that is more complex but that has a stronger empirical and a more coherent theoretical basis. Our results indicate that European countries are best seen not as displaying entirely continuous variation in their relative rates of class mobility, but rather as falling into a number of comparatively high and low fluidity groups. We offer an interpretation of these results that starts out from the proposition that within societies with a capitalist market economy, a nuclear family system and a liberal democratic polity, some limit exists to the extent to which relative mobility rates can be brought towards equality. Variation in such rates can then be understood in terms of how close nations are to this limit, and whether they are moving towards or receding from it, but with different forms of inequality impacting on their fluidity trajectories in differing ways.",TRUE,FALSE,Europe|Inequality|Social class|Social Mobility,2018-10-05T15:56:25.645766,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-05T15:54:59.773922,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",Authors,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/citation/,jkqne,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a4fub/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/relationships/node/,a4fub,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bb785003d0180001bea8b2f/,5bb785003d0180001bea8b2f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jkqne/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jkqne/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jkqne,NA

The Paris Agreement is intended to solve this collective action problem, but is likely insufficient. One proposed solution is a matching-commitment agreement, through which countries can change each other’s incentives by committing to conditional emissions reductions, before countries decide on their unconditional reductions. Here, we study matching-commitment agreements between two heterogeneous countries. We find that such agreements (1) incentivize both countries to make matching commitments that in turn incentivize efficient emissions reductions, (2) reduce emissions from those expected without an agreement, and (3) increase both countries’ welfare.

This study introduces a method that substantially reduces the data requirements of prospective models. The method allows estimating prospective models based on retrospective data commonly available in surveys. It addresses two key issues – retrospective sampling bias, and the problem of identifying representative cohorts. Additionally, we introduce a decomposition technique disentangling social and demographic pathways of reproduction. We illustrate the method using German data from NEPS and SOEP, focusing on educational reproduction of German men and women born between 1930 and 1945. The analysis offers new estimates of the expected number of higher and lower educated children born to men and women of different levels of education. Findings show that reproduction is constrained by educational gradients in women’s fertility, particularly in West Germany. We conclude that prospective designs advance our understanding of social inequality and its reproduction in families. The method that we introduce will facilitate future prospective research on social stratification.",TRUE,FALSE,East and West Germany|educational reproduction|fertility|prospective mobility models|social mobility|social reproduction,2018-10-05T10:01:41.150861,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-05T10:01:33.195783,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Jan Skopek; Thomas Leopold,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/citation/,3cjp6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kn5zf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/relationships/node/,kn5zf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bb71d2a2721c80017fa911c/,5bb71d2a2721c80017fa911c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cjp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3cjp6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3cjp6,NA
