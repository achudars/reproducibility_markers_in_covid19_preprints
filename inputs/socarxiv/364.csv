Admittedly, the Student Revolution spilled over into numerous fields. However, given space restrictions, only its cultural manifestations will be examined. It will be clear that at the root of Lodge’s students’ uprising lies an overpowering urge to break with the cultural heritage and with the academics upholding it. It will be equally clear, nonetheless, that these young activists’ faith in Marcuse’s political doctrine is unwelcome to conservative academics on the ground that it has diverse adverse effects on universities. Not only are politically oriented texts and discourses given precedence over traditional ones but also teachers and administrators are, at times, hindered from doing their duties. The plausible conclusion to draw, in the light of the research’s findings, is that although cultural revolutions undeniably pave the way for a number of personal and collective achievements and help us modernize many aspects of life, they should not blind us to the enduring significance of previous cultural traditions and of the aesthetic value of literary works.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural revolution|david lodge|herbert marcuse|proletarian|radical|the new left,2019-06-04T11:31:47.405050,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:12:26.069545,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/citation/,pfz4c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5e714d987b500188928ce/,5cf5e714d987b500188928ce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pfz4c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pfz4c/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pfz4c

It reflects the zeitgeist or the spirit of postmodernism which is regarded as a revaluation of the modern enterprise; an enterprise that embodies universality and coherence. The present research paper attempts to address the recurrent thematic element that postmodern fiction revolves around: that of the presence of the historiographic element in postmodern fiction which reflects in itself the evaluation of past history; such a fictional preoccupation reflects the major postmodern philosophers’ and thinkers’ concerns, such as those of Lyotard and Baudrillard, on the impossibility for the existence of a universal coherent history.

Tom’s Midnight Garden is regarded by some literary critics as a nostalgic work concerned with the past rather than the present. Its protagonist Tom is sometimes considered as disconnected from the real world and living in the fantastic. This paper will argue that, quite the contrary, Tom’s Midnight Garden stands against disconnection, between the child and the adult, the fantastic and the real, and the past and the present. Tom’s Midnight Garden celebrates connection through the interrelation between the self and the other, through a fantastic world constantly interwoven with the real, and a past tightly tied to the present.

Most accounts of campaigns’ strategic decision-makers treat them as masterminds – individuals who devise tactics based on brilliant political insight or masterful data analysis. Others assume they are mercenaries, milking the electoral process for all the money they can regardless of their own ideological commitments or what might actually help candidates win elections. Neither of these approaches is sufficient to understand how political professionals understand their work; they ignore both the fundamental uncertainty of campaign effects and the particularities of the work-world of political operatives. Drawing on 79 interviews with 67 campaign staff and consultants with high-level experience in Presidential and Senate campaigns, I argue that they should be understood as participants in a field of cultural production, which functions much like other arenas where communicative materials are crafted. Gaining esteem and coveted positions within the field is most participants’ primarily motivation, and the quality of the messages, images, and strategies they produce is judged less by measurable effects on voters than by an internally-generated set of norms and ideas about best practices.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-06-04T11:32:51.836895,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04T11:23:26.663181,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/citation/,2sb9m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf57f564df3460019bd54a6/,5cf57f564df3460019bd54a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sb9m/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2sb9m

Patterns in the Public Acceptance of Protest, 1985 - 2006","A social movement society refers to a society in which protest is a standard, institutionalized feature of the political landscape. Is the U.S. steadily becoming such a society? Whereas other empirical tests of the movement society thesis have focused on political tactics and individual participation in protest, we point to the public’s attitudes as another indicator of the movement society. Using General Social Survey data, we find that the public has grown more accepting of protest with time. In addition, using indicators of social location, social engagement, and political engagement as predictors, we find that while these factors help explain support for protest, their effects vary depending on the type of protest in question. Age, education, gender, income, employment status, and political interest all affect the acceptance of public meetings and demonstrations; however, the effect of income is reversed when it comes to the acceptance of a nationwide strike. Lastly, an age-period-cohort analysis finds evidence that a period effect is greater than a cohort effect in changing attitudes over time. Taken together, these findings support the claim that broad, societal-level influences have contributed to the public acceptance of protest, which is suggestive of a social movement society. Yet while the U.S. may constitute a social movement society, it is one with clear boundaries: individuals do support protest, but only to the extent that it does not disrupt the material advantages associated with their social location.",TRUE,FALSE,age-period-cohort analysis|protest|public opinion|social movement society,2019-06-06T19:26:03.742061,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-06T19:25:34.805899,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/citation/,79k3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5644a0966240018d85fc2/,5cf5644a0966240018d85fc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/79k3u/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00380237.2019.1624233,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/79k3u

The eco-mom theory—the belief that women have greater environmental concern than men because mothers primarily care about the health and safety of their children, while fathers primarily care about the economic support of their household—is often proffered as an explanation for this difference. Researchers who have previously tested the eco-mom theory have narrowly operationalized parenthood; we are skeptical of this theory and believe it needs additional testing. We look at fertility in relation to concern for climate change using the 2010 General Social Survey. Modeling parenthood like previous studies, we find no differences in concern for climate change between women who have children and those who do not. Modeling fertility, we find that having more children is associated with less concern for climate change for women but not men. Additionally, we find no gender difference in concern for climate change for those with many children, but these findings are complicated by education. Overall, we refute the eco-mom theory and call for new climate change survey data that better capture gender roles and identity as well as more qualitative inquiries into public concern for climate change.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|eco-mom theory|environmental concern|gender|social roles theory,2019-06-05T03:18:29.818616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-05T03:17:55.260068,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/citation/,5t4mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5594ed987b5001688f180/,5cf5594ed987b5001688f180,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5t4mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5t4mf/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496519852691,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5t4mf

The purpose of the book is threefold: (i) to present a historical and theoretical analysis of social protection systems and welfare regimes in contemporary Latin America; (ii) to discuss the politics of contemporary social protection and how national/global actors and institutions shape social policy in the region; and (iii) to examine several debates on social protection and welfare systems in contemporary Latin America. The chapter presents state-of-the-art research in the areas of social policy and welfare that is examined in each of the three parts of the book. What do we know about welfare regimes in Latin America? What do we know about the role of (f)actors shaping social protection development and inclusion?

Clemens offers a smart primer on political sociology that asks what is distinct about this sub-field. By surveying its main concepts and research agendas—power and politics, states, nation-states, social movements, social change, and transnationalism—she shows how political sociology examines social processes that influence both formal politics and the politics that take place in everyday settings. Clemens notes that that political sociology differs from political science in that the former studies politics in various settings and that patterns of political participation and the distribution of political power are shaped by social relations, while the latter studies “the formal institutions and acts of governing” (p.1).",TRUE,FALSE,Political Sociology|Social Cage|Social Closure,2019-06-05T03:16:50.396506,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-05T03:16:29.165913,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Nga Than,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/citation/,c6rvq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf509622a50c4001789bd10/,5cf509622a50c4001789bd10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c6rvq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c6rvq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c6rvq
