This poses a challenge to the agencies and officers in charge of providing supervision—there are far more offenders in need of supervision than officers can reasonably attend to. This has forced agencies to be innovative in how they allocate their resources. Empirical evidence suggests resources should be allocated to high-risk offenders, but how can officers determine which offender is at a higher risk of misconduct at any given time? Traditionally, this has been achieved by relying on standardized risk assessment. But risk assessment has been criticized for making only marginally better-than-chance predictions of future misconduct. We offer a novel solution by integrating the Elo-rating system into the community supervision decision-making process. We show, by drawing on test data from the Pathways to Desistance Study, that combining the Elo-rating system with traditional risk assessment may lead to increases in predictive power. We then discuss how Elo-rating systems could be used by community supervision agencies to more effectively prioritize their caseloads.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-11-11T20:46:23.087820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11T20:46:07.741293,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Shahin Tasharrofi and J.C.

In this paper I demonstrate that the selection of herd maximisation as a risk management strategy in the Northern parts of Norway has been influenced by a history of intra-group competition exacerbating between-herder conflict and lack of trust.

Descriptive phenomenology was utilized as the philosophical underpinning of the study. After obtaining the appropriate ethics clearances, seven (7) participants were selected to be co-researchers of the study based on preset criteria. Multiple interviews were done, tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim to form the narratives of the study.
Further, the approach espoused by van Manen was employed as the process of reflective explication of the narratives of the co-researchers. From the process, three themes were revealed and are as follows: (1) in a suspended reality, (2) bargaining with time, and (3) restless in a resting place. These themes are the overarching patterns of the lives of the co-researchers. Further reflection from these themes generated the essence of the co-researchers lives, encapsulated by the phrase “Hope within Hopelessness”. 
Insights from the study suggest that the co-researchers continue to have a glimmer of hope even though the overall context of their experience is that of hopelessness since they seem to have attributed DNR with imminent death.

Vitiligo is a highly visual, often stigmatizing, common skin condition that causes loss of pigmentation (color) which affects up to 2% of the population globally regardless of race or gender. Instagram was picked for this study due to its visual nature. This application allows the use of hashtags as a search tool for possible connections with others. The researcher interviewed people with Vitiligo who use Instagram about their experiences to better answer the queries related to the role of social media in the lives

We operationalize the three-systems model that understands functional settlement geographies through the interaction between the daily urban system, the central place system and the export base system. We utilize theoretically-informed selections of spatial interactions derived from travel survey data at the finely-grained postcode level. After examining the methodological challenge of the node-inclusivity dilemma, we estimate the causal mechanisms that geographically structure each system and determine which spatial interactions should be assigned to nodes (containment) and edges (connectivity). The three systems produce different regionalizations that are neither mutually exclusive nor perfectly nested. Further analysis of the multiplexity of the three systems reveals the importance of the imbricated boundaries between the urban subsystems. We argue that these interplaces deserve more attention as they are particularly sensitive to changes in urbanization trends.",TRUE,FALSE,Netherlands|nodalization|node-inclusivity dilemma|spatial interaction|three-systems model|urban network analysis|urban systems,2019-11-10T20:02:41.383212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-10T20:02:16.319121,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/citation/,y7dxf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc82de9a1cd9e000c72cf74/,5dc82de9a1cd9e000c72cf74,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7dxf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y7dxf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y7dxf,https://doi.org/10.1111/tesg.12391

Today, human sociopolitical complexity ranges from stateless small-scale societies to complex states that integrate millions of individuals over vast geographic areas. Here, we explore major transitions across this range of complexity. In particular, we examine the statistical structure of these transitions using Horton-Strahler branching, generalized Horton Laws, and allometric spatial mixed-effect models. We show that all major transitions in sociopolitical complexity follow an invariant fractal-like growth process; with each transition there is an additional level of jurisdictional hierarchy, a four-fold increase in population size, a two-fold increase in population area, and therefore a doubling of population density. These statistics fully describe all transitions from the least to the most complex societies. However, these transitions are probabilistic, not deterministic in nature. This fact explains the asymmetry of human sociopolitical evolution: while more complex societies were necessarily once less complex, less complex societies do not necessarily become more complex.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-11-10T20:01:02.491854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-10T20:00:48.276048,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/citation/,f693m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc81c25ee9bb9000e4d09cd/,5dc81c25ee9bb9000e4d09cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f693m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f693m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f693m,NA

The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with smoking. This study draws on 1980–2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000–2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes. Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort data that directly measure smoking status.

However, the consequences of this large- scale institutional change for the educational inequality between children from different social class backgrounds in East Germany continue to be poorly understood. This article seeks to shed new light on this question by using a quasi-experimental approach to examine the difference in educational inequality between East and West Germany before and after German unification. We compare changes in the class gradient in educational attainment in East and West Germany across six birth cohorts, including three cohorts of individuals who completed their schooling after unification. Contrasting with past findings, our results show that before unification, educational inequality at the mid-secondary, upper-secondary and tertiary level was substantially lower in East Germany than in West Germany and that unification led to a substantial and sustained convergence of the level of educational inequality in East Germany towards that of West Germany.",TRUE,FALSE,Central and Eastern Europe|Difference-in-difference design|Educational inequality|Education policy|Equality of opportunity|German unification|Intergenerational social mobility|Market transition|Post-socialist transition|State socialism,2019-11-09T16:37:21.613396,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-09T16:37:06.374171,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4f|Education|Vocational Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d64|Education|Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/citation/,bythr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc6a93d8f0e5e000bd02cb5/,5dc6a93d8f0e5e000bd02cb5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bythr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bythr,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcz012

This paper draws on data from 2,926 adults interviewed in the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health to examine how marital status, categorized as never, formerly, monogamously, and polygynous married, and number of children is associated with psychological well-being. With respect to marital status, we find that women in polygynous unions fare worse than monogamously married women and this detrimental effect is stronger for women than for men. Formerly married men and women of reproductive age experience the worst psychological outcomes, although this association wanes with age. In contrast, the benefits of having children is only evident among older Malawians, especially women. These findings offer novel insights into the patterns of nearly universal marriage and high fertility that characterizes Malawi and much of sub-Saharan Africa.",TRUE,FALSE,Fertility|Malawi|Marriage|Mental health|Polygyny|Sub-saharan Africa,2019-11-08T19:52:41.496110,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08T19:52:17.026641,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/citation/,6x5vw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc4c548a1cd9e000d70d2e4/,5dc4c548a1cd9e000d70d2e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x5vw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6x5vw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6x5vw,NA

These types of tools often define transitional industries including those at the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition, suggesting a variety of behavioral interpretations for the supposed evolution of Middle Paleolithic toolkits to Upper Paleolithic toolkits. Here we test an alternative hypothesis that transitional assemblages formed via secondary recycling of stone artifacts produced by two technologically divergent populations. Results from the application of an agent-based model indicate how ordered sets of assemblages resembling archaeological transitional sequences can result from the combination of simple recycling behaviors and periods of sediment deposition and erosion. This implies that some transitional assemblages could have formed without the interaction of different populations and/or without technological evolution.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|lithic recycling|lithic scavenging|transitional industries,2019-11-08T19:51:02.126644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08T19:50:43.553428,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/citation/,fg3zt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mn2kc/,mn2kc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc48592ee9bb9000c498b48/,5dc48592ee9bb9000c498b48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fg3zt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fg3zt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fg3zt,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41982-020-00055-4
