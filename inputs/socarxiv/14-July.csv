Since many European countries, including Belgium, have been confronted with high migratory pressure, it is important to develop prevention strategies and care paths for MARs affected by SV. Knowing possible risk factors for and consequences of SV in MAR in Europe and their help-seeking behavior is crucial to this. 
Methods: A critical interpretive synthesis of 37 peer-reviewed articles and 22 grey literature documents gave an overview of the existing evidence based on the socio-ecological model. 
Results: Risk factors and consequences of SV in MAR are comparable to those in the general population, but engender a different impact. We identified barriers for seeking and finding appropriate help after SV in MAR.
Conclusions: The vulnerability for and impact of SV on MAR may be far greater than in the general population due to the specific risk factors emerging from their vulnerable situation and help-seeking barriers associated with their migration status.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum seekers|help-seeking barriers|migrant health|rape|undocumented migrants,2021-06-22T05:08:50.804221,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-22T05:08:08.896445,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/citation/,85wxh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d0d3e273c72e0026c3aa40/,60d0d3e273c72e0026c3aa40,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85wxh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/85wxh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/85wxh,NA

This essay investigates the consequences of peer production for social protest, looking at how peer production reshuffles and remediates social change activism today. It explores the convergences and tensions between peer networks and contemporary social movements ranging from informal coalitions and amorphous grouping to traditional social movement organisations. First, it traces the historical trajectory of peer production as it has come to permeate the progressive social movements of the last three decades, linking distinct approaches to organizing to technological innovation. Second, it reflects on the so-called social affordances (and constraints) of digital infrastructure and their role in fostering specific modes of creativity and convergence apt to support protest actors. Third, it explores three types of consequences of peer production for social movements, namely cultural production and norm change, collective identity, and the commons. The chapter then examines three tensions that might emerge in the process of embedding peer production mechanisms and values in instances of collective action, namely: individual vs. collective engagements, peer networks vs. social movement organizations, and self-organized vs. commercial infrastructure.",TRUE,FALSE,collective|collective action|collective identity|individual|infrastructure|norm change|protest diffusion|social affordances|social movements,2021-06-22T05:07:47.392172,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-22T05:07:22.321315,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/citation/,8u32n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d0b0bef44078000d7573b5/,60d0b0bef44078000d7573b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u32n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8u32n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8u32n,NA

Equivalent areal estimates of economic activity derived from high-resolution night lights data (VIIRS) are shown to be a poor predictor of intraurban variation in living standards by comparison.

Together these surveys have produced a large corps of data that document how people think collectively toward various aspects of contemporary social life.The wealth of the attitude surveys has promoted scholars to move beyond the single-survey analysis. However, the use of survey data for studying trends in attitudes is handicapped by a measurement difficulty: different surveys have used different survey instruments to measure the same attitude and thus have generated data that strictly non-comparable. We propose the Latent Attitude Method (LAM) to address this issue. Our method borrows strength from two research traditions: (1) the latent variable method in attitude research and (2) the comparable distribution condition in survey design and evaluation. The core of this method is that, when two or more surveys overlap in a given year, we assume that the same latent attitude is measured as if two measurement scales are randomly given to two independent samples drawn from the same population. Thus, we can assume the same statistical properties for the latent attitude. In so doing, we are able to reduce the number of unknowns to be less than the number of established equations and estimate the best-fit parameters with maximum likelihood method. We demonstrate the utility of the method with simulated data, and apply the method to an empirical example of estimating America’s attitude toward China from 1974 to 2019.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitude change|Latent variable approach|Survey research,2021-06-21T10:04:42.062383,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-21T10:04:16.590408,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/citation/,atsq2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/umty5/,umty5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d029f9d6bcbc010f0914ee/,60d029f9d6bcbc010f0914ee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atsq2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/atsq2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/atsq2,NA

This dynamic can lead to salient religious identities and subsequent heightened religiosity.

Even as they secularize, I find that Christian children of immigrants assign more importance to religion compared to natives, a difference that does not decrease over time.

In this article, we argue that the distinct methodological merits of these two approaches can be equipped by adopting a more comprehensive analytical framework using the copula functions: (1) The copula functions concern the dependence structure that is independent from the margins, which enable scholars to focus on the relative mobility; (2) The copula density, estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically, reveals the nuanced morphological mobility patterns; (3) By residualizing the marginal variables, the detected mobility pattern can be interpreted in a stronger causal sense; and (4) the Cramér–von Mises Test offers an easy-to-use statistic to conduct intergroup comparison of mobility patterns. The copula-based framework is illustrated by investigating the income mobility between 1978 and 2017 in the U.S., using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79).",TRUE,FALSE,Intergenerational Income Mobility; Mobility Tables; Intergenerational Income Elasticity; Copulas,2021-06-20T20:58:08.813042,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-20T20:57:46.041814,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/citation/,mqph3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cf3f30d6bcbc00ed08c5a0/,60cf3f30d6bcbc00ed08c5a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mqph3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mqph3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mqph3,NA

For this reason, the world’s public sectors need to improve their efficacy by using a sound risk management system. This study attempts to comprehend the phenomenon of current risk management practices among the public sector employees in different service schemes in Malaysia. A questionnaire survey was utilized to collect primary data from 194 department heads in Malaysia’s federal ministries. The collected data was analysed using descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Findings revealed that 94.7% of respondents agreed to implementing risk management in their respective departments, but the level of priority for these risk management factors differs based on the service schemes. This study will assist policymakers to identify what is needed to enhance risk management practices in the public sector.",TRUE,FALSE,Factor Analysis|Malaysia|Pubic Sector|Risk Management,2021-06-20T20:55:26.038937,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-20T20:54:56.171492,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/citation/,am3hd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/asd8h/,asd8h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60cea29dd6bcbc00b508cd9f/,60cea29dd6bcbc00b508cd9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am3hd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/am3hd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/am3hd,https://doi.org/10.1504/IJBEM.2020.10032965
