Big data systems, labour, control, and modern retail stores","The modern retail store is a complex coded assemblage and data-intensive environment, its operations and management mediated by a number of interlinked big data systems. This paper draws on an ethnography of a superstore in Ireland to examine how these systems modulate the functioning of the store and working practices of employees. It was found that retail work involves a continual movement between a governance regime of control reliant on big data systems which seek to regulate and harnesses formal labour and automation into enterprise planning, and a disciplinary regime that deals with the symbolic, interactive labour that workers perform and acts as a reserve mode of governmentality if control fails. This continual movement is caused by new systems of control being open to vertical and horizontal fissures. While retail functions as a coded assemblage of control, systems are too brittle to sustain the code/space and governmentality desired.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|code/space|control|discipline|governmentality|retail|work,2018-07-02T11:17:47.885970,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-23T19:46:24.102124,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/citation/,z9dgc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rphkj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/relationships/node/,rphkj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ee41b86c613b02632f821d/,59ee41b86c613b02632f821d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z9dgc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z9dgc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z9dgc,NA

Using a novel process-tracing method, the study looks for violence monopolization patterns within and across the cases of Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Sierra Leone.

While students without any exposure to wangba are substantially less likely than those who have to report academic underperformance, the result becomes random after matching when the logit regression is less model-dependent and vulnerable to the problems associated with missing data.

Multigenerational Correlations in Family Wealth,"Inequality in family wealth is high, yet we know little about how much and how wealth inequality is maintained across generations. We argue that a long-term perspective reflective of wealth’s cumulative nature is crucial to understand the extent and channels of wealth reproduction across generations. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that span nearly half a century, we show that a one decile increase in parents’ wealth position is associated with an increase of about 4 percentiles in their offspring’s wealth position in adulthood. We show that grandparental wealth is a unique predictor of grandchildren’s wealth, above and beyond the role of parental wealth, suggesting that a focus on only parent-child dyads understates the importance of family wealth lineages. Second, considering five channels of wealth transmission — gifts and bequests, education, marriage, homeownership, and business ownership — we find that most of the advantages arising from family wealth begin much earlier in the life-course than the common focus on bequests implies, even when we consider the wealth of grandparents.

Given the complexity of RJC as a concept and as a process, such ‘limits’ might be attributed to the capacity and characteristics of youth offenders. To date, however, there has been little examination of developmental, cognitive, or environmental impediments on the part of youth offenders in terms of achieving restorative outcomes in RJC.

However, less is known about how and why. This research examines conference convenor perspectives concerning how and why RJC ‘works’ in terms of such outcomes. The convenor perspective is a poorly investigated area in RJC research, despite the pivotal role that convenors play as ‘key’ participants in RJC practice. Based on semi-structured interviews with convenors involved in the Youth Justice Group Conferencing program in Victoria, findings highlight that not only face-to-face dialogue, but also preparation and follow-up play distinct and important roles in the outcomes of RJC. As preparation and follow-up phases are often dismissed or compromised in practice, this article suggests that RJC should be clearly articulated and implemented as a ‘holistic’ process that requires equal attention to all three phases.",TRUE,FALSE,Australia|convenor|facilitator|restorative justice|youth justice,2018-07-02T11:16:50.838404,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-18T22:50:09.224311,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Current Issues in Criminal Justice,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/citation/,s6uyt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/79bk6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/relationships/node/,79bk6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e7da25594d9002610e745a/,59e7da25594d9002610e745a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s6uyt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s6uyt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s6uyt,NA
