As with other public policies, the achievement of policy goals in Nigeria is usually encumbered by numerous factors of implementation across various sectors. In the health sector, factors such as inadequate physical infrastructure, shortage of healthcare personnel, limited medical supplies etc. have hindered the implementation of several health policies. National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) is one of such policies and this study examined the effects of shortage of healthcare personnel on the implementation of NHIS policy in FCT, Abuja. Specifically, the study evaluated the opinions of health workers as well as enrollees of NHIS in four purposively chosen Area Councils of the six Area Councils in FCT. This study adopted a survey research design with Rensis Likert’s five-point scale questionnaire instrument administered to both categories of respondents. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version 25) and the T-tested statistical tool was used to test the hypothesis. The study found out that shortage of health personnel is a major barrier to the effective implementation of NHIS in the FCT, Abuja. Consequently, the study recommends that there should be massive recruitment of qualified healthcare personnel; training and retraining of healthcare workers; and timely and adequate remuneration for the healthcare workers in FCT, Abuja.",TRUE,FALSE,Healthcare|Health Personnel|NHIS|Public Policy,2021-04-17T19:32:28.346331,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-17T19:31:55.475878,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/citation/,8wtgf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/relationships/node/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6078ff93eb9cc900ca14f310/,6078ff93eb9cc900ca14f310,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wtgf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8wtgf/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.02.276,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8wtgf

Nevertheless, sensitive sectors like agriculture present difficulties because of the need to adapt to the new competition. Consequently, trade policy may affect economic conditions and lead to incentives for illegal activities. Using municipal level data for Colombia, I examine the effect of trade liberalization in the agricultural sector on coca crops. Using a difference-in-differences strategy in the Colombia-US Free Trade Agreement framework, I find that municipalities that depend highly on the cultivation of the most important crops present a differential decrease in the area covered with coca after the agreement implementation. The effect is consistent with incentives from more market access and more imports of lower-price inputs. I find that credit access drives the decrease in coca.

In contrast, no such framework and much less empirical evidence exist to explain cross-national differences in wealth inequality. This situation is particularly lamentable as cross-national patterns of inequality in wealth diverge sharply from those in income. We seek to pave the way for new explanations of cross-national differences in wealth inequality by tracing them to the influence of different wealth components. Drawing on the literatures on financialization and housing, we argue that housing equity should be the central building block of the comparative analysis of wealth inequality.
Using harmonized data on fifteen countries included in the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS), we first demonstrate a lack of association between national levels of income and wealth inequality and concentration. Using decomposition approaches, we then estimate the degree to which national levels of wealth inequality and concentration relate to cross-national differences in wealth portfolios and the distribution of specific asset components. Considering the role of housing equity, financial assets, non-housing real assets, and non-housing debt, we reveal that cross-national variation in wealth inequality and concentration is centrally determined by the distribution of housing equity.

Perceptions of rewilding impacts among English farmers using a socio-ecological wellbeing and values approach.,"1. Minimal intervention, process-oriented ecological restoration, popularly called rewilding, is rapidly gaining traction in the UK as a forward-looking, optimistic agenda for ecological recovery and reversing biodiversity losses. However, proposals for projects of this nature have also created polarisation between people with differing views on the future of the countryside. 
2.To increase the social equitability of rewilding, reduce conflict and improve the success of such programs, it is necessary to ensure that stakeholder views are deeply understood. The farming community is a key stakeholder group in the debate about how restoration and rewilding should be done. However, the way farmers perceive rewilding to affect them is not well documented. 
3.We combined an integrative social-ecological wellbeing perspective with farming values to examine the perceived linkages between rewilding, farmers’ wellbeing, and factors affecting support for different rewilding scenarios (beaver release, a farm restoration, and landscape restoration). We conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 36) with farmers, land managers and farming association representatives. 
4.Using thematic analysis, we identified the perceived wellbeing impacts of different rewilding scenarios, farming values, factors affecting the extent of support or opposition, and mitigation options available to lessen the negative impacts. 
5. Our results detail the range of rewilding impacts perceived by farmers, including little-explored issues regarding autonomy and agency in farm management; food security and ethics of food production; and conservation of existing wildlife. We show that farm-scale enclosed projects are perceived to retain greater control of potential impacts and to be more compatible with farming than landscape-scale rewilding or unenclosed species reintroductions. However, our findings demonstrate a variety of positions towards rewilding among the farmers, underpinned by different value orientations. Our results can usefully inform rewilding policy and practice to account for the needs of different stakeholders and navigate conflicts between them.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|farming|food security|restoration|rewilding|social impacts|socio-ecological wellbeing,2021-04-15T17:45:41.032368,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15T16:40:32.901222,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/citation/,u3a5e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6078648f0c81820078512d3a/,6078648f0c81820078512d3a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3a5e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u3a5e/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u3a5e

An emerging literature has documented the impact of meritocratic narratives in media, mostly focusing on newspapers. In this paper, we study music as a potential source of cultural frames about economic inequality. We construct an original dataset combining user data from Spotify with lyrics from Genius to inductively explore whether popular music features themes of economic inequality. In order to do so, we employ unsupervised computational text analysis to classify the content of the 3,660 most popular songs across 23 European countries. Informed by Lizardo’s enculturation framework, we study popular music lyrics through the lens of public culture and explore its links with individual beliefs about inequality as a reflection of private culture. We find that, in more unequal societies, songs that frame inequalities as a structural issue (songs about “Struggle” or omnipresent “Risks”) are more popular than those adopting a meritocratic frame (songs we describe as “Bragging Rights” or those telling a “Rags to Riches” tale). Moreover, we find that the presence in public culture of a certain frame is associated with the expression of frame-consistent individual beliefs about inequality (private culture). We conclude by offering reflections on the promise of automatic text classification for the study of music lyrics, the theorized role of popular music in the study of culture, and by proposing venues for future research.",TRUE,FALSE,computational methods|inequality|meritocracy|music|unsupervised text analysis,2021-04-15T17:10:08.869505,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15T15:35:41.483700,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/f4r86/,available,NA,https://osf.io/39rgm|https://osf.io/yvjh5/,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/citation/,3s5m2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5427t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/relationships/node/,5427t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6078587ac29ca80094eb2e29/,6078587ac29ca80094eb2e29,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s5m2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3s5m2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3s5m2

The study works with platform data in the form of the text of posts and accompanying metadata along with 16 interviews with users. Drawing on trace ethnography as an approach to maintaining an interpretive stance while combining several types of data, this preliminary analysis discusses two interrelated particularities of the tension. The discussion of these particularities, platform mechanics and competing temporalities, helps to unpack a tension that is both a phenomenon of analytic interest and a member’s concern for users of the platform.",TRUE,FALSE,Community question answering|informal learning|knowledge sharing,2021-04-15T17:03:29.021810,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15T15:06:25.938041,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://archive.org/details/stackexchange,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/citation/,ycg9u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6078532bc29ca80083eb4ac6/,6078532bc29ca80083eb4ac6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycg9u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ycg9u/,https://doi.org/10.1145/3430895.3460981,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ycg9u
