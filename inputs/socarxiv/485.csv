This article offers the Sociology of the Symbolic Landscape (SSL) as the theoretical solution to the challenge of studying meaning and applying the concept of race within and across contexts. SSL focuses on the relationships between symbolic categories within a context and their positions in the core/periphery distinction. Incorporating insights from Durkheim, Interpretive Sociology, the study of Symbolic Boundaries, Civil Sphere Theory, and Postcolonial Theory, SSL makes it possible to identify and categorize positions, thereby identifying the way meaning acts as a source of constraint and of creative possibilities, and enabling cross-contextual comparison of culture-structures and forms. Through application of SSL to data on categorizations in Sweden, we demonstrate the analytical traction SSL provides. SSL offers a portable understanding of the racial other as “outsider within,” a distinct position of enduring alterity and persistent difference within the symbolic landscape. Unlike outward-looking categories defined on the basis of a pre-existing religious attachment, ethnic group, or non-native nationality, the outsider within is an internally referenced category defined in negation – social membership with problematic and atypical belonging.",TRUE,FALSE,civil sphere|cultural sociology|culture|exclusion|immigration|inclusion|race and ethnicity|Sweden|symbolic boundaries|symbolic landscape,2018-08-10T09:53:21.777160,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T09:52:59.416996,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Anna Lund and Andrea Voyer,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/citation/,8gbj9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p34eg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/relationships/node/,p34eg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6cf364bb82f50017be41b5/,5b6cf364bb82f50017be41b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8gbj9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8gbj9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8gbj9,NA

The results are predicted by cognitive psychological theories and findings from educational psychology. However, many “bootcamp” (short and intense preparation) type training opportunities – especially train the trainer - have some anecdotal evidence of their success and impact. Data and Software Carpentries (“The Carpentries”) is an organization that offers short/intensive training workshops around the world similar to some of those discussed in the 2017 paper. They train “users” of data and software, and they also train trainers of these users. In their response to this 2017 paper, The Carpentries acknowledge that one point raised in that paper, that training spaced over time is more successful than shorter/more intense training, cannot be circumvented. However, short and intense training is popular, and is sometimes all that is feasible; both their train the user and train the trainer sessions are short and intense. In their response, The Carpentries described their own strategies for achieving more positive outcomes for short and intense training than were described in this 2017 PNAS article. Two of these strategies are: “meet learners where they are” and “explicitly address motivation and self efficacy”. These strategies may not be functioning as well as they could be. To clarify what might be impeding these strategies, this white paper compares and contrasts features of training those who will train others (“train the trainer”) with training for “new users”. These types of programs are short and intense, but differ in fundamental ways. Understanding these differences can be leveraged to improve the outcomes of train the user training; recommendations for doing so is presented. The recommendations are embedded in descriptions of those features of training opportunities that can be leveraged purposefully to promote sustainable learning, even when training is short and intense. It is hoped that the model can support the success of the two Carpentries strategies to promote the achievement of Carpentries goals –and those of all who offer short/intensive training opportunities.",TRUE,FALSE,bootcamps|cognitive psychology|The Carpentries|training|train the trainer|train the user,2018-08-10T09:50:05.174101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-10T09:49:42.356401,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/citation/,jsfe9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xb2ym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/relationships/node/,xb2ym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b6cb20752fa4200185bc0fa/,5b6cb20752fa4200185bc0fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsfe9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jsfe9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jsfe9,NA

This conceptualization is at odds with how 'revolutionary' protest often unfolds—protest does not begin life as democratic or revolutionary but grows in a process of positive feedback, incorporating new constituencies and generating new demands. Using an original protest event catalogue for the twenty-nine days of the Tunisian Revolution, alongside survey data, I show that the correlates of protest occurrence and participation change significantly during the uprising. The effect of economic development on protest diffusion reverses sign, while a commitment to democracy is a substantive predictor of protest participation only at its close. If protest is not revolutionary at its onset, I argue, theory should reflect this and be able to explain the endogenous emergence of democratic demands.

Implications for Cultural Analysis in Sociology,"In this paper we introduce the idea of the dual process framework (DPF), an interdisciplinary approach to the study of learning, memory, thinking, and action. Departing from the successful reception of Vaisey (2009), we suggest that intradisciplinary debates in sociology regarding the merits of “dual process” formulations can benefit from a better understanding of the theoretical foundations of these models in cognitive and social psychology. We argue that the key is to distinguish the general DPF from more specific applications to particular domains, which we refer to as dual process models (DPMs). We show how different DPMs can be applied to a variety of analytically distinct issues of interest to cultural sociologists beyond specific issues related to morality, such as culture in learning, culture in memory, culture in thinking, and culture in acting processes.

Here we use the Rice Cultivation Projects Compliance Offset Protocol—which has generated no offsets since its adoption by the California Air Resources Board in 2015—as a case study to examine barriers to agricultural offset generation. These barriers, which include small projects; low emissions reduction potential; complex emissions quantification; complex, non-standardized data management; and high verification costs, apply to many unproductive agricultural offset protocols and present an opportunity for additional policy action. By examining other protocols in North America’s compliance and voluntary offset markets, we identify design elements that can overcome these barriers and facilitate offset generation. These elements include standardized, technology-aided data management; streamlined emissions quantification methods such as emissions factors or N-balance; and project bundling.",TRUE,FALSE,Carbon Offset Protocol|Emissions Factor|N-balance|Transaction Costs|Verification,2018-08-06T18:55:45.694430,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-06T18:55:19.523634,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/citation/,yrfgz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8hrxb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/relationships/node/,8hrxb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b688afcf07de800190ba8b2/,5b688afcf07de800190ba8b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrfgz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yrfgz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yrfgz,NA

In comparison, some Gulf states petroleum sector’s GDP contribution is usually more than 30 percent. A fundamental reappraisal of the Nigeria’s petroleum sector’s relationship with the economy is required. This paper posits that the missing link between the petroleum sector and Nigeria’s GDP growth is the country’s petroleum refining capacity. Capacity utilization of Nigeria’s refineries dropped to 14 percent in 2014 against a global average refining capacity utilization of 90 percent. The constraints of crude oil supply to Nigeria’s refineries are revealed as well as policy interventions by the Federal Government of Nigeria aimed to increase in-country oil refining capacity. Refining capacity is suggested as an antidote to Nigeria’s so-called ‘resource curse’.",TRUE,FALSE,Economy|GDP|Natural Resources|Nigeria|Petroleum|Refinery|Resource Curse,2018-08-06T18:47:41.319855,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-06T18:47:13.086746,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Uyiosa Omoregie,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/citation/,5raqk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gfcy5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/relationships/node/,gfcy5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b687e5a21ed790016bb1d58/,5b687e5a21ed790016bb1d58,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5raqk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5raqk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5raqk,NA
