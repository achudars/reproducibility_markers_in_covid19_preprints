Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists. Here, boys are stratified in accordance to a popularity ranking, which is determined by the possession of a matrix of variables: Namely, charisma, authenticity, emotional support, and social fluidity.",TRUE,FALSE,friendship|hegemony|hierarchy|masculinities|popularity,2019-02-13T00:49:08.189250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-13T00:47:30.415376,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/citation/,bcwuq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6177d076653c00192759fa/,5c6177d076653c00192759fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bcwuq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bcwuq/,https://doi.org/10.1525/sop.2011.54.1.83,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bcwuq

The Protest Behaviour of the 1989 Generation in Europe,"Many studies suggest that citizens of Central and Eastern Europe are less politically active than their peers in Western Europe. Yet, it is unclear whether previous experiences of mobilization moderate these differences. This article focuses on the protest behaviour of the 1989 generation, which is composed of citizens who reached political maturity during the collapse of communism. Building on political socialization theory, the article proposes that citizens exposed to high levels of protest during their formative years might be more inclined to protest later. This implies that mobilization during the transitions from communism might moderate the current East-West gap in participation. The article combines data from 25 new and old democracies to assess how early exposure to protest has affected the participation of the 1989 generation. The results of multilevel models indicate that participation in demonstrations is not significantly lower in Central and Eastern Europe once we account for the level of protest at the turn of the nineties. Furthermore, the Eastern deficit in participation in petitions and boycotts is lower in societies that experienced higher levels of protest during the collapse of communism.

This study incorporates the newest education polygenic score (Lee et al. 2018) into sociological research, and tests three gene-environment interaction hypotheses on status attainment. Using the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,625), I report three findings. First, a standard deviation increase in the education polygenic score is associated with a 60% increase in the likelihood of advancing to the next level of education, while a standard deviation increase in parental education results in a 68% increase. Second, supporting the Saunders hypothesis, the genetic effect becomes 11% smaller when parental education is one standard deviation higher, indicating that highly educated parents are more able to preserve their family’s elite status in the next generation. Finally, the genetic effect is slightly greater for the younger cohort (1942~59) than the older cohort (1920~41).

One dimension of precarious work of growing interest to scholars and policymakers is instability faced by workers in the amount and regularity of their work hours. However, we know little about the magnitude of month-to-month or week-to-week (intra-year) volatility in hours worked, the extent of class-based polarization in this measure of job quality, and whether worker power moderates this polarization. In this paper, we make novel use of the panel nature of the nationally-representative Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate intra-year volatility in the actual hours respondents report working in the previous week across four consecutive survey months. Using this new measure, we then show that, net of demographic characteristics and controls for occupation and industry, low-wage workers experience disproportionately greater work hour volatility. Finally, we find evidence that reductions in marketplace bargaining power--as measured by higher state-level unemployment rates--increase wage- and education-based polarization in work hour volatility, while increases in associational power--as measured by union coverage--reduce wage-based polarization in work hour volatility.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-11T04:41:27.729159,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-11T04:41:13.039536,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/citation/,rzfg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c60f11476653c0019271c60/,5c60f11476653c0019271c60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rzfg2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rzfg2

This paper contributes to this literature by employing for the first time the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the long-run association between individual incarceration and mortality over nearly 40 years, and supplementing those analyses with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79).

Methods: A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of a review of a sample of unresolved homicides, a comparative analysis of the frequency of known serial homicide series and unresolved serial homicide series, and semi-structured interviews of experts.
Results: The past decade contained almost half the cases (13%) that existed at the 1980s peak of serial homicide (27%). Only 282 (1.3%) strangled females made up the 22,444 unresolved homicides reviewed. Most expert respondents thought it unreasonable that any meaningful proportion of missing persons cases are victims of serial homicide. 
Conclusions: Technology, shifts in offending behavior, proactive law enforcement action, and vigilance of society have transformed serial killing and aids in viewing offenders as people impacted by societal shifts and cultural norms. The absence of narrative details inhibited some aspects of the review. An exhaustive list of known unresolved serial homicide series remained elusive as some missing persons are never reported. Future research should incorporate those intending to murder serially, but whose efforts were stalled by arrest, imprisonment, or death.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-02-11T04:40:47.144509,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-11T04:40:16.376617,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2f|Law|Law Enforcement and Corrections|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/citation/,esyvg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5f327976653c001b2f6936/,5c5f327976653c001b2f6936,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/esyvg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/esyvg/,https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2019.1678450,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/esyvg

Giving some theoretical information about the role of HRM in academic staff development and academic mobility, the authors focus on internationalization of institutional strategies and HRM. Institutional structures, processes, support and incentive mechanisms in higher education institutions are examined. Drawing attention to the lack of human resources support tools, they emphasize the role of human resources unit in international mobility of academic staff for staff development and conclude that an effective institutional strategy in collaboration with HRM and international office is needed to overcome obstacles and promote mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Staff Mobility|Higher Education|Higher Education Institution|Higher Education Research|HRM|Human Resources Management|Internationalization,2019-02-10T03:45:05.304376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-10T14:54:03.853883,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/citation/,ejrt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5eebfde16f55001790aaab/,5c5eebfde16f55001790aaab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejrt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ejrt5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ejrt5

Many issues surrounding cognitive ability especially those related to heredity is highly charged. Yet, all of the discussion on heredity has been based on non-DNA evidence. It is largely neglected that DNA and environmental data at individual level are indispensable for understanding the development of cognitive ability. In this article, we report findings from a study that uses both ability-related polygenic scores (PGSs) and a rich set of socioeconomic measures from Add Health. In an all-ethnicity sample excluding blacks, a social-science model predicts verbal ability well yielding an R2 of 17.5%. Adding two ability-related PGSs increases this R2 by 1.7%. Such models yield more accurate estimates of the effects of the PGSs and those of SES context, and provide an estimated degree to which SES context is influenced by parental genomes. Schooling and neighborhood remain important to verbal ability even after an early measure of verbal ability is adjusted in the model. Although the influence from the genome is evident, the influences of SES context are critical and cannot be dismissed.",TRUE,FALSE,Add Health|cognitive ability|gene-environment interaction|genomics|polygenic score|verbal ability,2019-02-09T00:09:03.015170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-09T00:08:30.522244,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/citation/,gz7er,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5e0e1376653c0018271959/,5c5e0e1376653c0018271959,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gz7er/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gz7er
