With the member nations of the Arab League striving to promote Arab-Islamic culture and the Arabic language, Arabic came to symbolize tradition and Islamic values and the English language and Western culture, modernity and materialism (Al Zeera 19990; Charise 2007; Findlow 2006).  While government-run schools adopted Arabic as their medium of instruction relegating English to the status of a second language, most of post-secondary education continued to be imparted through the medium of English, leaving English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learners inept at coping with the academic demands of higher education.  The introduction of ESL in Grade Four in primary schools is partly to be blamed for the ESL learners’ inadequacies.  Rising criticism from tertiary level educators and employers necessitated the introduction of ESL in Grade One in 2004 in Bahrain (Bahrain Ministry of Education, 2003).  Sweeping national reforms in the educational arena in Bahrain have led to the revamping of curriculum, instruction and assessment standards in an attempt to ensure Bahrain’s educational system is of international standards (Quality Assurance Authority for Education &amp; Training 2011).  The purpose of this review article is to trace the way English Language teaching has changed since the colonial days in the Middle East, especially in Bahrain and the reasons necessitating the change. This paper also has implications for research on the English proficiency levels of freshman students today who have learned ESL since Grade 1.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:33:25.737658,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:13:16.217121,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/citation/,uwyhk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ke7q5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/relationships/node/,ke7q5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45c7ebb794960010b06b39/,5a45c7ebb794960010b06b39,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwyhk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uwyhk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.30,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uwyhk

Infographics combine data with design in order to communicate information to an audience in a comprehensible manner. This study is motivated by the lack of resources that directly study the influence of infographics on linguistics. It aims to investigate the impact of using information graphics in the teaching of linguistics on Saudi students. The researchers seek to answer the following questions: (i) What is the Saudi female EFL students' perception of using infographics as a tool for learning linguistics and semantics? (ii) What are the advantages &amp; disadvantages of using infographics as a tool for learning linguistics and semantics? To this end, 186 Saudi female college students from the Department of Translation at the College of Languages in Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU) took part in this study. They designed infographics as a project in two linguistic courses: Introduction to Linguistics and Introduction to Semantics. They were provided a 26-item questionnaire. The questionnaire was analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The participants’ responses were analyzed according to quantitative data analysis procedures. The findings show the students’ positive attitude towards using infographics even though the majority were not familiar with them. While creating infographics, the participants found practicing various skills such as higher thinking skills beneficial. However, issues such as technical problems were perceived as a hindrance.

Sixty-four open-access English social science research articles published in 2013-2015 in the ScienceDirect General category were selected and compiled to the Social Science Corpus (SSC). The AntWordProfiler 1.4.0 was utilized to calculate the frequency and coverage percentage of words from the two word lists. Word families in level 1 and level 2 of the NGSL were utilized over 70 percent, whilst level 3 word families were used around 60 percent of the entire SSC. Similarly, 99.65 percent of the AWL word families were discovered. Regarding coverage, the NGSL word families accounted for over 70 percent and the AWL word families covered around 14 percent revealing significant coverage of both word lists. The top 10 NGSL word families represented journals subject areas from which they were derived, whilst the top 10 AWL word families were used more repeatedly and linked with social science research areas. The finding of high distributions and coverage corroborated that the NGSL and the AWL significantly contribute to vocabulary pedagogy in preparing students for reading and writing social science research articles.

These learners fail to use this aspect appropriately in discourse due to a difficulty in internalising its real meaning. Our survey shows that these English as a foreign language (EFL) learners associate the present progressive with only one context of use- the one referring to actions/ events happening around NOW or at the moment of speaking. Students generally fail to go beyond this focal meaning. They tend to ignore the other contexts where the present progressive can be used. Along with this complexity/ plurality of meaning, the problem could be attributed to some deficiencies in the learning and the teaching enterprises as well. This paper draws both students’ and practitioners’ attention to a number of facts related to the learning/ teaching of this aspect. The study provides a detailed description of the different functions/ uses of the present progressive with examples. Moreover, it highlights the situations / contexts that are more problematic to students on the basis of our test’s results.

The current study examines what EFL teachers in a Saudi EFL context believe about teaching pronunciation, how they teach pronunciation, and what pronunciation training they have. Fifty-five English language teachers at the English Language Center at Taif University in Saudi Arabia were asked to complete an online survey regarding pronunciation teaching. Their responses were subjected to quantitative descriptive analysis. The results revealed that the teachers highly valued pronunciation teaching, and most of them considered it as important as teaching other language skills. In addition, most of the teachers reported incorporating pronunciation teaching into their English classes.

This study involved 34 first-year English major students taking Intensive English course at Universitas Lambung Mangkurat, one of leading universities in Indonesia. The students in the experimental group were taught by using tongue twister, while those in the control group were taught by using repetition technique. The students were also grouped based on two types of learning styles, namely active and reflective learning styles referring to Felder and Silverman’s (1988) learning style model. The findings of the study showed that there was no significant difference in pronunciation ability between the groups. No significant difference was either found in pronunciation ability between students with active learning style and those with reflective learning style. In spite of the insignificant results, tongue twister is considered beneficial by the students as they perceived that practicing tongue twisters cultivated joyful learning and it helped them to improve their pronunciation, fluency, and motivation in learning English pronunciation.

Further, there is a need to investigate the linguistic email communication problems that Saudis encounter when they study abroad. This study aims to identify the dominant features of email communication of twenty Saudi and Australian post-graduate students with their lecturers. The research sought to understand the following: to what extent negotiation moves differ from one group to another;  if there is a significant difference between the two raters when rating native speakers (NS) versus non-native speakers (NNS); whether there is a significant relationship between students’ scores and total number of words used in negotiation moves; the most important moves that might have affected the raters’ decisions when giving the highest scores versus the lowest scores;  and whether there is difference between total scores of NS and NNS. Whereas the qualitative analysis employed (im)politeness as the theoretical framework, the quantitative analysis focused on the moves used by students in terms of  context, proposal, justification, options, and  requests. It was found that NS and NNS had similar likelihoods of gaining higher grades when using more details.

As one observes the multitude of current global conflicts, one questions why humanity has not been able to move beyond petty grievances to achieve the equitable global harmony and citizenship that Aurelius aspired to so long ago. Motivated by the purpose of improving academic, economic, and social equity, this exploratory essay examines historic and current North American pedagogical theories of culturally responsive teaching practices with the juxtapositional purpose of examining and evaluating the best method for minimizing Drs. Ernst Jentsch and Sigmund Freud’s theories on the uncanny and the uncanny valley-effect phenomena-the objective being the discovery of improved teaching praxis to minimize educational and social cognitive dissonance in refugee, immigrant, minority, and socioeconomically subordinate students both domestically and internationally.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural competency|international education|teacher training|uncanny,2018-07-02T11:31:09.649345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:18:00.334924,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/citation/,9w8cp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dzwe4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/relationships/node/,dzwe4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45ba04b794960011b1c06a/,5a45ba04b794960011b1c06a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w8cp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9w8cp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.22,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9w8cp

Participants included 118 EFL learners at Sulaymaniyah University in Iraq, all of whom were studying in the School of Basic-Education English Department. Two instruments were employed to collect data: a VLS questionnaire designed by Schmitt (1997) was administered in order to determine the range and frequency of VLS use, and a four-level (2000, 3000, 5000 and academic word list) vocabulary learning test (VLT) designed by Schmitt, et al. (2001) was used to measure learners’ receptive vocabulary size. The aim of this study was to determine the kinds of strategies learners utilized as well as their  relationship to students’ VS. The results demonstrated that students utilized consolidation more frequently than discovery strategies. Moreover, the most frequently utilized VLS was studying the sounds of new words, while the least frequent one was working in groups to discover the meanings of new words. In terms of total VLS, the students can be considered as moderate VLS users (M= 3.003). The results of correlation analysis revealed that there exist positive, negative and sometimes no relationships between learners’ VLS and VS. Finally, the findings of multiple regression analysis concluded the R Square value to be (0.284), which means that the predicted variables could account for 28.4% of the participants’ levels of receptive VS.This study concluded that systematic and appropriate strategies support learners to increase their VS.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:31:09.607394,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:18:59.152942,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/citation/,emxtz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uq7kd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/relationships/node/,uq7kd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45b8feb794960012affa58/,5a45b8feb794960012affa58,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/emxtz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/emxtz/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.21,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/emxtz
