How a user engages can be divided up into many sub sections, but in its simplest notion it’s how a person interacts with the content that is presented to them. Engagement is also a sing that a person has payed attention to what is being presented to them.
YouTube was created by former PayPal employees Steve Chen, Jawed Karim and Chad Hurley in 2005, and today with 1 billion monthly active users, it is the most used social networking and video sharing platform on the internet. YouTube also has a powerful effect in that it enables people to spread content effortlessly and freely to a wide and open audience. Understanding the incredible power of YouTube can be highlighted by examples such as Justin Bieber who rocketed to international stardom and fame via the platform, or how the world stopped and focused on Kony in 2012. Much of this success and popularity of the website has been explained by the fact that users are able to communicate “through textual and video responses as well as video rating systems” (Milliken, Gibson, O’Donnell &amp; Singer 2008).
This research paper serves to make important contributions to topics of viral marketing and engagement behaviours of users on YouTube. This is important when considering the popularity of YouTube and the numbers of users actively engaging in content, especially for business and individuals who use YouTube as their source of income. Research on various microblogging platforms has revealed “that microblogs can be tailored to facilitate informal communication between colleagues in organizations”, (Suh, Hong, Pirolli, &amp; Chi, 2010) but there is little research that explores video blogging communities on YouTube. This research paper will explore how tags and the length of videos impact user engagement in the Motor Vlogging community.
In section 2, a general overview of related in relevant research is presented, followed by the research question and hypothesis in section 3 which explores the relationship between social engagement on YouTube Motor Vlogger videos from Australia and how the presence of tags and the length of the videos impact on the levels of engagement. The methodology of the research is presented in section 4 with results presented and discussed in sections 5 and 6 respectively.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-02T21:22:21.328963,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-02T21:21:57.066636,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/citation/,ysx5d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jhe5p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/relationships/node/,jhe5p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b63086cdedf030013c14031/,5b63086cdedf030013c14031,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysx5d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ysx5d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ysx5d,NA

We then describe intervention processes that have been successful in bringing the ratio of women close to parity, compare different minorities in the US, and also consider data from India, Western and Eastern Europe. We conjecture that programs that connect the different levels of education are needed in addition to hiring more women, providing them with basic human rights from when they begin their PhD onwards and promoting support networks for existing employees.

This was because business donors were overwhelmingly concerned with the left-right dimension and enjoyed stable relationships with centre-right parties.  These parties are increasingly tempted by nationalist positions on a globalisation dimension.  This new ideological flux provides an opportunity to measure the extent to which donors are party identifiers or react to changes in the policy space. Dramatic shifts in party policy on both dimensions and a relatively transparent political finance regime make the UK a particularly apposite case to study this question. I analyse 19,000 donations to the Conservative Party and show that business donors reacted strongly to recent shifts on both the left-right and globalisation dimensions.  Thus, centre-right parties cannot rely on party identification and their left-right position to maintain business funding.

Measures of entropy reveal a city’s streets’ order and disorder. Past studies have explored individual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader patterns and trends worldwide. This study examines street network orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100 cities around the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city’s typical street segment length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network’s proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order that quantifies how a city’s street network follows the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity. These indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the grid.

We collected a dataset of Twitter accounts in Egypt and Tunisia during the critical year of 2013, when the Egyptian military overthrew the Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. We find that the coup increased retweets among Egyptian ideological allies by 50 percent each day following the coup and decreased cross-ideological retweets by 25 percent.

First, the development of local governance in Armenia and the role and place of local governments in the governance structure of this country have been analyzed. In the paper, Armenia’s local government system in the context of ECLSG and the correspondence of Armenia’s local governance legislation to the principles and clauses of this charter are analyzed. In line with this objective, the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, its municipal legislation and other statutes have been analyzed, and the reflection of the ECLSG clauses ratified by Armenia in these statutes is examined. In addition, the regional policies and regulations aiming at the elimination of Armenia’s inter-regional differences in terms of development and their results are examined.

İlk önce Ermenistan’da yerel yönetimlerin gelişimi ve ülkenin idari yapılanmasında yerel yönetimlerin rolü ve yeri incelenmiştir. Makalede Ermenistan’ın yerel yönetimler sistemi, Avrupa Yerel Yönetimler Özerklik Şartı (AYYÖS) bağlamında ve yerel yönetimler mevzuatının bu şartın ilkelerine ve maddelerine uyum sağlayıp sağlamaması açısından incelenmektedir. Bu amaç doğrultusunda Ermenistan anayasası, belediye mevzuatı ve diğer yasalar incelenmiş ve onlarda Ermenistan tarafından onaylanmış olan AYYÖŞ’ün maddeleri ne derecede yansıtıldığı incelenmiştir. Ayrıca, sosyo-ekonomik gelişmişlik açısından önemli bölgelerarası dengesizliklere sahip olan Ermenistan’da, bu dengesizlikleri ortadan kaldırmak ve azaltmak için ülkenin geliştirdiği politikalar ve düzenlemeler ve onların sonuçları incelenmektedir.",TRUE,FALSE,Armenia|AYYÖŞ|bölgesel politika|ECLSG|Ermenistan|local government|regional policy|yerel yönetimler,2018-08-03T10:40:42.775985,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-03T10:40:19.569750,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c67|Law|Legislation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d87|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Other Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/citation/,g698k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a36vq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/relationships/node/,a36vq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b61ede0fd63eb000e5add96/,5b61ede0fd63eb000e5add96,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g698k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g698k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g698k,NA

Based on this as a main structure of the theory, Lefebvre’s periodization of space – aimed at the tracing the spaces being produced during each mode of production – is discussed. In the paper, the spatial triad aiming at understanding and conceptualization of social space is discussed as well. Thus, for any study of space in different contexts, an easily adaptable and applicable structural and conceptual framework of Lefebvre’s theory is presented.

Turkish Abstract: Makalenin amacı Lefebvre'nin 'Mekânın Üretimi' kitabının bir okumasını gerçekleştirerek, kitapta öne sürülen mekân kuramının yapısının ve temel kavramsal çerçevesinin yeniden değerlendirilmesidir. Bundan hareketle kuramın temel yapısı olarak her üretim tarzında üretilmekte olan mekânların çözümlemesine yönelik Lefebvre'nin önerdiği dönemselleştirmesi değerlendirilmiştir. Ayrıca makalede toplumsal mekânın anlamlandırılması ve kavramsallaştırılması için kuramda öne sürülen mekânsal üçlü değerlendirilmiştir. Böylece, somut bağlamda gerçekleştirilebilecek herhangi bir araştırma için Lefebvre'nin kuramının kolayca uygulanabilir ve benimsenebilir bir kavramsal çerçevesi çizilmiştir.",TRUE,FALSE,Henri Lefebvre|mekân dönemselleştirmesi|mekânın üretimi|mekânsal üçlü|periodization of space|production of space|spatial triad,2018-08-03T10:43:07.960185,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-03T10:42:51.489026,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d87|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Other Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/citation/,4793w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5j62u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/relationships/node/,5j62u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b61ec5cfd63eb000d5b59bc/,5b61ec5cfd63eb000d5b59bc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4793w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4793w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4793w,NA

I argue that the lesson learned from this literature is threefold: (1) educational institutions in practice significantly distort the ideal meritocratic process; (2) opportunities for merit are themselves determined by non-meritocratic factors; (3) any definition of merit must favor some groups in society while putting others at a disadvantage. Taken together, these conclusions give reason to understand meritocracy not just as an unfulfilled promise, but as an unfulfillable promise. Having problematized meritocracy as an ideal worth striving for, I argue that the pervasiveness of meritocratic policies in education threatens to crowd out as principles of justice, need and equality. As such, it may pose a barrier rather than a route to equality of opportunity. Furthermore, meritocratic discourse legitimates societal inequalities as justly deserved such as when misfortune is understood as personal failure. The paper concludes by setting a research agenda that asks how citizens come to hold meritocratic beliefs; addresses the persistence of (unintended) meritocratic imperfections in schools; analyzes the construction of a legitimizing discourse in educational policy; and investigates how education selects and labels winners and losers.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|education|inequality|legitimation|meritocracy|morality|politics,2018-08-01T16:22:25.099157,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-01T16:22:05.543302,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/citation/,6w9rg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c9nuw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/relationships/node/,c9nuw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4f5f9e33f0b9000cbaf320/,5b4f5f9e33f0b9000cbaf320,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6w9rg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6w9rg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6w9rg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-014-0228-0

To the surprise of many, empirical studies often found minimal effects. The predominant focus of early work was on U.S. elections, though. Nazi propaganda as the archetypal and, in many ways, most likely case for strong effects has rarely been studied. We collect extensive data about Hitler’s speeches and gauge their impact on voter support at five national elections preceding the dictatorship. We use a semi-parametric difference-in-differences approach to estimate effects in the face of potential confounding due to the deliberate scheduling of events. Our findings suggest that Hitler’s speeches, while rationally targeted, had a negligible impact on the Nazis’ electoral fortunes. Only the 1932 presidential runoff, an election preceded by an extraordinarily short, intense and one-sided campaign, yielded positive effects. This study questions the importance of charismatic leaders for the success of populist movements.",TRUE,FALSE,american political science review|apsr|campaign effects|causal effects|diff-in-diff|germany|hitler|matching|nazi party|nsdap|political science|preprint|propaganda|propensity scores|rallies|speeches,2018-08-01T14:26:41.638059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-01T14:26:15.640668,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/citation/,t75p3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5d7p3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/relationships/node/,5d7p3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b615cf8fd63eb000f5a5114/,5b615cf8fd63eb000f5a5114,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t75p3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t75p3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t75p3,NA
