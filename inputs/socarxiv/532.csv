International Journal of Discrimination and the Law, Vol 16(2-3), 61-65","‘The Equality Act 2010: five years on’ conference was organized as a collaboration between the Forum for Research into Equality and Diversity (University of Chester) and the School of Law and Social Justice (University of Liverpool). The Equality Act 2010 has arguably been one of the most important and challenging pieces of legislation introduced in the last decade in the United Kingdom. As such, it was felt that the 5-year anniversary of its implementation provided an excellent opportunity to bring together those researching and practising in this area of law. In particular, the conference was intended to provide the opportunity for a review of the implications and impact of the legislation during this period, but also to consider the way in which it can continue to promote equality and protect against discrimination into the 21st century.

As organizers, we were keen to focus the themes of the conference around the broad range of socio-legal study taking place across the United Kingdom in relation to the Equality Act 2010. While many conferences have focussed on the implications of the legislation for practitioners and wider exploration of equality across a variety of sectors, it was felt that there were few academic gatherings permitting researchers to explore the impact of the Equality Act from a socio-legal perspective. Contributors were invited to submit papers and poster presentations across a range of themes around the legislation including, but not limited to, the public sector equality duty, intersectionality, positive action, strategic enforcement, hierarchy of protected characteristics, education, etc.

The quality and range of papers and posters submitted and presented at the conference exceeded expectations. As had been hoped, the variety of socio-legal study being carried out across the United Kingdom around the Equality Act was exceptional. The conference, therefore, provided the space and opportunity to come together to explore the implications of this work and to build upon existing dialogues and networks in order to provide a better connected and less isolated evidential basis for the future development of the legislation. The collection of articles within this publication is an excellent representation of some of the themes explored at the conference. We are very grateful to the International Journal of Discrimination and the Law for providing the opportunity to expand the dialogue around the socio-legal implications of the Equality Act 2010 beyond the conference via this special edition.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|equality|Equality Act,2018-10-16T22:19:02.782436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T22:18:43.686604,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination,Chantal Davies|Nuno Ferreira|Anne Morris|Debra Morris,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/citation/,3y46r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2x5gw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/relationships/node/,2x5gw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc65a008811c1001955539e/,5bc65a008811c1001955539e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3y46r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3y46r/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358229116655645,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3y46r

We study ``horse race'' news (news on candidates' chances in an upcoming election) from six major online outlets for the 2012 and 2016 US presidential campaigns. We find robust evidence that horse race headlines were slanted congenially with respect to the preferences of the outlets' typical readers. However, evidence of congenial slant in the timing and frequency of horse race stories is weaker. We also find very limited evidence of greater within-outlet demand for headlines most congenial to outlets' typical readers, and somewhat stronger evidence of greater demand for relatively \emph{uncongenial} headlines. We discuss how various aspects of our results are consistent with each of the major mechanisms driving slant studied in the theoretical literature, and may help explain when each mechanism is more likely to come into play. In particular, readers may be more likely to click on uncongenial headlines due to inferring that these stories are particularly informative when they stand in contrast to an outlet's typically congenial slant.",TRUE,FALSE,echo chambers|horse race news|media bias|media slant|polarization|selective exposure,2018-10-16T22:13:21.822344,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T22:13:06.619437,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/citation/,fy2we,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c2k56/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/relationships/node/,c2k56,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc64f058811c1001a54f681/,5bc64f058811c1001a54f681,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fy2we/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fy2we/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fy2we

That feeling inevitably affected many individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, queer and other (LGBTIQ+). Although the possible impact of Brexit seems to have been scrutinised from most angles, there has been limited analysis of how it may affect LGBTIQ+ individuals.

There is certainly more than one ‘gay in the village’, so it is worth assessing Brexit in relation to the situation of LGBTIQ+ individuals.

British Politics and Policy LSE blog, London.","Judged by the level of political debate, public policy and academic literature, the work of children (under-18s) in England and Wales is neither of interest nor of concern. And yet the absence of this topic from the policy agenda is far from indicative of its lack of relevance or timeliness. In fact, figures from the Labour Force Survey suggest that about a third of young people aged 16-17 are active in the labour market. Many of these young people, and others even younger, work illegally for a range of reasons: because of the number of hours worked, their age, the type of work carried out, the time of day worked, or because they lack a work permit. 
Indeed, in 2013, Nils Muižnieks – the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights – reported on children working long hours in the UK as a consequence of the late 2000s economic crisis. And in 2015, at a seminar held in Liverpool, several children of high school age spoke candidly about practices of dubious legality that they experienced at work, including low pay, informal work arrangements, deficient health and safety conditions, and sexist recruitment procedures, not to speak of detrimental effects to their education. More generally, we should be alarmed that children who work mainly carry out unskilled and manual labour, are poorly paid, acquire limited recognisable skills, jeopardise their educational attainment, sustain accidental injuries (in particular in delivery and agricultural work), may not be covered by insurance and accident cover, are often burdened with caring duties, and may even be recruited by the military.

We present a case study of the relationship between Britain First, a far-right anti-Muslim social movement, and the U.K. Independence Party, the Eurosceptic political party that spearheaded the Brexit campaign. The movement appeared marginal in the press but it dominated social media, and used this presence to support to the party. We examine the dynamics of the relationship between these groups from 2013 until 2017, drawing upon data from social media, newspapers, and other online sources, and focusing both interactions on between elites and rank-and-file supporters. Our findings illustrate how far-right groups have used new technologies to generate an unprecedented amount of popular support and to attempt to influence the political mainstream.",TRUE,FALSE,brexit|computational sociology|facebook|far-right|political parties|social media|social movements,2018-10-16T20:12:21.039270,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T20:12:03.796038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/citation/,bmq5n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/42ygr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/relationships/node/,42ygr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc6352353cec4001bae7ba3/,5bc6352353cec4001bae7ba3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmq5n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bmq5n/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bmq5n

Using Future Treatments to Detect and Reduce Hidden Bias,"Conventional advice discourages controlling for post-outcome variables in regression analysis. Here, we show that controlling for commonly available post-outcome (i.e. future) values of the treatment variable can help detect, reduce, and even remove omitted variable bias (unobserved confounding). The premise is that the same unobserved confounders that affect treatment also affect future values of the treatment. Future treatments thus proxy for the unmeasured confounder, and researchers can exploit these proxy measures productively. We establish several new results: Regarding a commonly assumed data-generating process involving future treatments, we (1) introduce a simple new approach to reduce bias and show that it strictly reduces bias; (2) elaborate on existing approaches and show that they can increase bias; (3) assess the relative merits of approaches; (4) analyze true state dependence and selection as key challenges; and (5) demonstrate that future treatments can test for hidden bias, even when they fail to reduce bias. We illustrate these results empirically with an analysis of the effect of parental income on children’s educational attainment.",TRUE,FALSE,causal inference|DAG,2018-10-17T05:02:22.470857,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:07:46.565815,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/citation/,yhtpu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ne6mc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/relationships/node/,ne6mc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b76cf2a95f24f0016ede883/,5b76cf2a95f24f0016ede883,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yhtpu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yhtpu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yhtpu

Working Paper. Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2013-18, University of Warwick","European Union law has curtailed the traditional discretion Member States have in ordering non-nationals to leave their territory. Although Directive 2004/28 (the Citizenship Directive) has enhanced the system of protection afforded to offending European Union citizens, it still contains a number of cracks that lead to policy incoherence and gaps in rights protection. This is evident in the first rulings on Article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38 concerning the deportation of offending EU citizens. These issues also threaten to transform European Union citizenship from a fundamental status into a thin overlay that, under pressure from national executive power, loses its effect and significance. To be sure, EU citizenship has demonstrated that community belonging does not have to be based on organic-national qualities, cultural commonalities, or individuals' conformity to national values, but the continued deportation of long-term resident Union citizens makes nationality the ultimate determinant of belonging. The subsequent discussion suggests possible remedies and makes recommendations for institutional reform.",TRUE,FALSE,|Deportation|derogations|Derogations from Free Movement|European citizenship|expulsion|free movement|International Migration Law|migration|Public Policy|Public Security,2018-10-16T17:10:22.711107,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-16T17:08:12.672854,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4d|Law|Social Welfare Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/citation/,5nxb4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v42gc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/relationships/node/,v42gc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc5ed7753cec40019ad5a89/,5bc5ed7753cec40019ad5a89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nxb4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5nxb4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5nxb4
