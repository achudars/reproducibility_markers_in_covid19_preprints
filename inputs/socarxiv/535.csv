A glimpse of the debate over the written versus the spoken form,"The primacy of speech in second language learning and the relative lack of importance of the written form have triggered a continuous debate in the field of language teaching methodology. The various approaches which have been developed throughout the years emphasise the importance of the spoken language. Therefore, the written form has been taken for granted in most teaching methodologies. This paper considers the question of whether second language learners learn best through spoken or written language. It reviews the literature with regard to how speaking and writing have been taught in the last two decades. In addition, it describes the differences between spoken and written forms of languages. The paper then presents some characteristics and features of both language forms and states the situation of teaching English in a foreign language context. The paper concludes that both spoken and written aspects of any language are important in language learning and they both complement one another. Second language learners need to learn both aspects in order to master the language. The degree of exposure to spoken or written language is yet determined by the learners’ purpose for learning the language.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language|language learning|spoken language|teaching methodologies|written language,2018-07-02T13:32:11.283655,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:45:04.467497,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/citation/,n6aeb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7ut3q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/relationships/node/,7ut3q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc457ba2409b00109ddf0f/,5abc457ba2409b00109ddf0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6aeb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n6aeb/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n6aeb

To that end, this mixed methods study aimed to identify the needs and preferences of English as a Foreign Language teachers regarding working with special-need students. The study also sought to explore the relationship between participants’ profile and their needs. Two hundred eighteen in-service teachers at primary schools in Egypt were selected by cluster sampling method to participate in a need assessment questionnaire while eight were interviewed. Participants reported lack of training in inclusive education, large class size, negative attitudes, shortage of time, heavy workload, and unfamiliarity with necessary strategies as barriers to inclusion. In addition, participants prioritized their needs for identification of language disorders, teaching methods, individualized instruction through curriculum adaptation and Individualized Educational Plans, and controlling behavioral problems. There were significant differences in participants’ needs based on age, years of experience and qualifications.

The participants were 35 Saudi EFL female pre-service teachers in the Educational Diploma Program (EDP) attending Teaching Practicum (1) Course in Taibah University, Saudi Arabia. A mixed method, which contains both quantitative and qualitative research design, was used to collect data. Research instruments comprised a perception opinionnaire designed to measure the perceptions of EFL pre-service teachers towards the challenges they face in teaching experience during the practicum. The results showed that EFL pre-service teachers considered the observation period during the Teaching Practicum (1) Course between moderately and extremely beneficial. The results of the perceptions of EFL pre-service teachers regarding classroom-teaching skills were between highly and moderately to low challenging. Additionally, their skills related to school environment indicated less challenging than skills related to classroom teaching experiences. The results of the open-ended question were divided into three meaningful and thoughtful categories to add much depth and understanding of the research problem. Some recommendations based on the results were derived. For example, EFL pre-service teachers needed further development in teaching experiences and skills related to classrooms and school setting.

To achieve this goal, teachers’ professional identity has been further questioned, thereby generating debates and issues regarding their role. What teachers need to know, what beliefs they should hold and how they can achieve their professional development, are among the core intentions of today’s teacher education.

Proper names are considered as a leading group of onomastic units due to its extra linguistic component and direct connection with a human being. The processes of globalisation influence on all spheres of life and name giving process is not an exception. Challenges of nomination are explained in the article. The actuality of the paper is defined by the authors’ point of view who cling to the idea that in modern globalized world only a proper name could be an only identifier of the national and confessional identity of an individual.  Historical milestones that impact on name giving process are mentioned and social factors which influence name giving process are classified and described. Proper names have passed a long evolutionary way from a word – the identifier of a person among similar to legally significant sign of a linguistic personality, a register component which defines a social status and position of the individual in society. The research is relevant in the linguistic, social, national and cognitive aspects, as it demonstrates an interaction between language and society.

Linguistic acquisition is a natural development that begins to develop in children from birth and enables communication.  The cognitive domains necessary to comprehend language is also required in order for the formation of ToM to develop.  The interpretations made through ToM presumptions can contain the discernment of another’s false belief.  In this context, the individual must be aware that the literal interpretation could be an inaccurate symbol or manufactured belief.  This understanding requires a certain level of cognitive development in the child since the intention may be to signify something else and the child must be able to correctly process idiomatic expressions in order to accurately make ToM determinations (Caillies &amp; Le Sourn-Bissaoui, 2008).  This paper explores the relationship between ToM and linguistic acquisition in normally developing children, as well as those with various disabilities to ascertain the degree of cognitive development necessary in order to make ToM determinations.  Exploration of this relationship reveals that linguistic and cognitive development are both essential in the construct of ToM perceptions in early childhood.",TRUE,FALSE,language development|linguistic acquisition|theory of mind,2018-07-02T13:32:10.867459,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:47:06.171827,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/citation/,fkr43,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fbp9g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/relationships/node/,fbp9g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc34b5a2409b00109dd3f2/,5abc34b5a2409b00109dd3f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fkr43/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fkr43/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fkr43

While literature on SE and its dimensions is rich in the field of education, still there is a lack of studies aiming to explore teachers’ SE in contrast with their actual teaching skills and their characteristics. For this reason, this study aims to respond to the following research questions: are there differences between perceived SE and actual teaching performance in preschool and primary school teachers? Which sources of SE can be considered as significant predictors of teachers’ SE? This work employs a quantitative approach based on the observational method. Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale and classroom observation frameworks were used to collect data from a sample of 24 teachers. Results show that there are high inconsistencies between self-judgments and actual teaching performance (p &gt; .05). Experienced and medium experienced teachers show higher scores than novice teachers in several dimensions of SE (p &lt; .05). However, teachers’ educational background is not significantly correlated with their SE (p &gt; .05). Resource support is found as the only significant predictor of SE in our sample of teachers (p &lt; .001; p2 = .733). Our research suggests that teachers may have a distorted perception of their in-class performance, which could drive to lower quality of the teaching-learning process. Therefore, in the future, professional training programs should focus on promoting a more realistic understanding and awareness of teachers’ actions in the classroom as the first step of any intervention aiming to increase teaching quality.",TRUE,FALSE,assessment|classroom observation|teacher behavior|teachers’ self-efficacy|teaching performance,2018-07-02T13:32:10.823924,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-29T13:47:20.907342,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/citation/,5nq8b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7aghq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/relationships/node/,7aghq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abc332aa2409b00119dd5e2/,5abc332aa2409b00119dd5e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5nq8b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5nq8b/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no1.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5nq8b
