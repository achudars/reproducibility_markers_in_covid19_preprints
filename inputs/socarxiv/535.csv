The book has a strong Foucauldian flavour, exploring the ways in which power relationships are produced in this context. Ammaturo crafts a smooth flow of ideas, arguments and sources that address in a comprehensive fashion how these intersections need to be unpacked, dissected and brought to daylight for everyone’s benefit. And she does so in an accessible and ambitious way, without ever becoming simplistic or obscure – no mean feat.

Ammaturo’s starting point is Europe as a continent defined as ‘an aspirational entity and symbolic space of belonging’ (p. 1, original italics). In this space, gender and sexual minorities (referred throughout the book as LGBTQI persons) arguably play a crucial role in the definition of ‘European identity’ and ‘European Citizenship’ and contribute to Europe having increasingly adopted a ‘symbolic position of catalyst for social change’ (p. 2) for these minorities. Both human rights and citizenship frameworks and discourses have contributed to these developments. Ammaturo is keen to explore the grey areas in these developments and unleash the potential for radical transformation of current constraints on the citizenship and rights of gender and sexual minorities. To do this, Ammaturo chooses the Council of Europe – and the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg Court) in particular – as the context in which a ‘European sexual and gendered citizenship’ can be tested and put to its limits. In doing this, Ammaturo offers particular attention to a specific group within the diverse gender and sexual minorities that exist: LGBTQI asylum seekers and refugees.

In this review essay, I will explore some of the book’s key arguments and touch on some differences of opinion. Perhaps, these differences are mostly the result of different disciplinary backgrounds: while Ammaturo is fundamentally an international relations and social sciences scholar – thus perhaps more concerned with broader policy and institutional mechanisms – I am fundamentally a lawyer – thus more inclined by training to concentrate on particular policymaking areas and require strong evidence to substantiate final conclusions. This review essay will thus reflect the challenges faced by all of us academics in the field of sociolegal studies and interdisciplinary research more generally.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum|citizenship|cjeu|echr|european court of human rights|european union|gender identity|human rights|lgbtqi|refugees|sexuality,2018-10-14T14:38:22.309545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:38:05.850312,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c35|Law|Sexuality and the Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/citation/,nr5fz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5bkjf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/relationships/node/,5bkjf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc3297a512c03001790a544/,5bc3297a512c03001790a544,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nr5fz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nr5fz/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0964663917748003,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nr5fz

Do Social Comparisons Play a Role?,"Two of the most prominent phenomena in the study of social determinants of health, the socio-economic gradient in health and the income inequality–health association, have both been suggested to be explainable by the mechanism of status comparisons. This, however, has rarely ever been tested in a direct fashion. In this article, we explicate and test this mechanism by assessing the role of social comparison orientation. Research has shown that individuals vary in their propensity to engage in social comparisons, and those with a higher propensity are also more likely to be affected by the outcomes of such comparisons. In our analysis, we check whether the tendency to compare one’s income to that of others can contribute to explaining socio-economic disparities in health. Using individual-level data (N = 18,356) from 23 European countries on self-rated overall health and psychological well-being, we show that a high-income comparison orientation neither moderates the negative effect of income inequality on health nor the health differences by relative income. Our findings cast doubt on the crucial role that researchers such as Wilkinson and Pickett (2010) have attributed to the mechanism of status differentiation as the link between social stratification and health outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,Health|Health disparities|Health inequalities|Income inequality|International comparison|Social comparison|Wellbeing,2018-10-14T14:35:21.805384,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:35:11.394235,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",The authors,2014,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/citation/,2wky8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/46xw3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/relationships/node/,46xw3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc1d58eac0110001a6c6f38/,5bc1d58eac0110001a6c6f38,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2wky8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2wky8/,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jct035,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2wky8

This is implausible for many social phenomena. York and Light (2017) showed how to estimate asymmetric models by estimating first-difference regressions in which the difference scores for the predictors are decomposed into positive and negative changes. In this paper, I show that there are several aspects of their method that need improvement. I also develop a data generating model that justifies the first-difference method but can be applied in more general settings. In particular, it can be used to construct asymmetric logistic regression models.",TRUE,FALSE,causal inference|directional asymmetry|first difference|fixed effects|generalized least squares|LSDV|panel data,2018-10-12T13:58:01.815401,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-12T13:57:40.259167,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/citation/,kv8a5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yrme9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/relationships/node/,yrme9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc098a032a16e001ca82d55/,5bc098a032a16e001ca82d55,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kv8a5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kv8a5/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023119826441,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kv8a5

(AI) research and its deployment in various societal domains and contexts. In this context, media and
communications is one of the most prominent and contested fields. Bots, voice assistants, automated (fake)
news generation, content moderation and filtering – all of these are examples of how AI and machine
learning are transforming the dynamics and order of digital communication.
On 20 March 2018 the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society together with the non-
governmental organisation Access Now hosted the one-day expert workshop “The turn to AI in governing
communication online”. International experts from academia, politics, civil society and business gathered in
Berlin to discuss the complex socio-technical questions and issues concerning subjects such as artificial
intelligence technologies, machine learning systems, the extent of their deployment in content moderation
and the range of approaches to understanding the status and future impact of AI systems for governing
social communication on the internet.
This workshop report summarises and documents the authors’ main takeaways from the discussions. The
discussions, comments and questions raised and responses from experts also fed into the report. The report
has been distributed among workshop participants. It is intended to contribute current perspectives to the
discourse on AI and the governance of communication.",TRUE,FALSE,AI|artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|Content moderation|Content Moderation|machine learning|Machine Learning|platform governance|Platform Governance|social media|Social Media|society-in-the-loop,2018-10-14T14:31:01.456727,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:30:45.335975,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/citation/,vwpcz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/djyp6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/relationships/node/,djyp6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc09295366e5e0017ce0112/,5bc09295366e5e0017ce0112,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vwpcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vwpcz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vwpcz
