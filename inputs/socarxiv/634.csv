Diglossia involves the use of two varieties of the same language by the same society for different functions. The principle objective of this independent inquiry is to study the impact of Arabic diglossia on L2 learners of Arabic studying this language in the native Arab environment i.e. Saudi Arabia, which is the centre of MSA variety of Arabic. This study also aimed at understanding the effect of awareness about Arabic diglossia on the motivation of L2 learners. Qualitative methodology has been used to gain an in-depth view of the perceptions and the motivation level of L2 learners in two language institutes in Saudi Arabia. The primary data has been collected through self-administered questionnaires from 15 participants studying Arabic at various stages of language learning in the selected language institutes. The secondary data has been taken from various past researchers and literary works related to the topic of this dissertation. It has been found that the L2 learners of Arabic are generally aware of the Arabic diglossia and understand the functional differences between CA and MSA, but this situation doesn’t significantly affect their learning progress as assessed by their academic learning progress before and after attending the language centre and their willingness to continue learning the Arabic language. Indeed, learners studying at advanced stages of Arabic find the diglossic situation motivating and challenging, unlike the starters who were negatively affected (demotivated) by the presence of multiple varieties of Arabic as they find it an intimidating task to learn multiple varieties of Arabic under the umbrella of learning one language.Additionally, social circle and the number native Arabic speaking people around the L2 learners of Arabic have a huge impact on the motivation level of the learners who not only get a higher exposure to CA but also learn the spoken variety from their peers which in return positively motivate them to learn Arabic in the native Arab setting",TRUE,FALSE,colloquial Arabic|Diglossia|modern standard Arabic|motivation|perception,2018-07-02T11:33:25.976463,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:22:37.322626,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/citation/,f3shd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rdbv3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/relationships/node/,rdbv3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45cfe5b794960010b06d59/,5a45cfe5b794960010b06d59,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f3shd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f3shd/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.190,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f3shd

Critics often overlook the piece in their reading of Coleridge although it has an interesting story between the lines. Besides enriching the unfinished surface one, the submerged tale carries significant revelations about Coleridge’s literary relationship with foreign cultures and elements, the Dark Lady in this particular case. The present study intends to divulge the hidden tale in the text and to use its revealed construct to throw light on Coleridge’s engagement with the Other in his literary experience. It employs a formalist reading of the text and pays attention to point of view. It also invokes culture and allegory in the process of eliciting the significance of the embedded tale. My reading intimates that Coleridge’s imaginative aspiration towards the exotic Other is more congenial to his poetic creativity than other modes of the imagination. It also suggests that this Other might as well be the Orient.

This study aims to survey the attitudes of a group of Iranian university teachers at a state university in central Iran towards the possible use of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) in Iranian higher education, where Persian is currently the medium of instruction except in English language departments. It also explores whether teachers’ attitude towards EMI is affected by their university rank. To this end, 60 teachers were randomly selected from faculties of Humanities, Science, and Engineering, and their perceptions about EMI were explored through questionnaires and interviews. The findings indicated that, in spite of the current emphasis on Persian by authorities, teachers valued English over Persian as the medium of instruction, expressing concerns mainly about inadequacies in resources and English proficiency requirements. Interview results showed that their opinions were divided as they enumerated a variety of economic, academic, cultural, social, and technological reasons both for and against the possible use of EMI at Iranian tertiary levels.

It also considered whether a definite conclusion was possible. A qualitative research methodology using the published evidence was adopted. The published evidence supporting or rejecting the advantages of bilingualism was collected using search terms in the Google Scholar search engine. A total number of 64 papers were collected, among which only five challenged the claimed advantages enjoyed by bilingual individuals. The papers were classified by their orientation and discussed. Based on the points derived from the evaluation of evidence, some conclusions were drawn.  The overwhelming research support in favour of the existence of supposed bilingual advantage tends to suggest a conclusion in favour of that hypothesis. However, the points raised by critics, such as small sample sizes, inadequate matching of other variables, as well as defective measurements and analysis cannot be ignored as they question the very validity of the studies which support bilingual advantage.

With the member nations of the Arab League striving to promote Arab-Islamic culture and the Arabic language, Arabic came to symbolize tradition and Islamic values and the English language and Western culture, modernity and materialism (Al Zeera 19990; Charise 2007; Findlow 2006).  While government-run schools adopted Arabic as their medium of instruction relegating English to the status of a second language, most of post-secondary education continued to be imparted through the medium of English, leaving English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learners inept at coping with the academic demands of higher education.  The introduction of ESL in Grade Four in primary schools is partly to be blamed for the ESL learners’ inadequacies.  Rising criticism from tertiary level educators and employers necessitated the introduction of ESL in Grade One in 2004 in Bahrain (Bahrain Ministry of Education, 2003).  Sweeping national reforms in the educational arena in Bahrain have led to the revamping of curriculum, instruction and assessment standards in an attempt to ensure Bahrain’s educational system is of international standards (Quality Assurance Authority for Education &amp; Training 2011).  The purpose of this review article is to trace the way English Language teaching has changed since the colonial days in the Middle East, especially in Bahrain and the reasons necessitating the change.

(ii) What are the advantages &amp; disadvantages of using infographics as a tool for learning linguistics and semantics? To this end, 186 Saudi female college students from the Department of Translation at the College of Languages in Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU) took part in this study. They designed infographics as a project in two linguistic courses: Introduction to Linguistics and Introduction to Semantics. They were provided a 26-item questionnaire. The questionnaire was analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The participants’ responses were analyzed according to quantitative data analysis procedures. The findings show the students’ positive attitude towards using infographics even though the majority were not familiar with them.

These learners fail to use this aspect appropriately in discourse due to a difficulty in internalising its real meaning. Our survey shows that these English as a foreign language (EFL) learners associate the present progressive with only one context of use- the one referring to actions/ events happening around NOW or at the moment of speaking. Students generally fail to go beyond this focal meaning. They tend to ignore the other contexts where the present progressive can be used. Along with this complexity/ plurality of meaning, the problem could be attributed to some deficiencies in the learning and the teaching enterprises as well. This paper draws both students’ and practitioners’ attention to a number of facts related to the learning/ teaching of this aspect. The study provides a detailed description of the different functions/ uses of the present progressive with examples. Moreover, it highlights the situations / contexts that are more problematic to students on the basis of our test’s results. Most importantly, the findings show that the conventional traditional grammar course has many limitations.

However, it is still not yet known in many EFL (English as a foreign language) settings whether this finding has any effect on the current beliefs and practices of English language teachers. The current study examines what EFL teachers in a Saudi EFL context believe about teaching pronunciation, how they teach pronunciation, and what pronunciation training they have. Fifty-five English language teachers at the English Language Center at Taif University in Saudi Arabia were asked to complete an online survey regarding pronunciation teaching. Their responses were subjected to quantitative descriptive analysis. The results revealed that the teachers highly valued pronunciation teaching, and most of them considered it as important as teaching other language skills. In addition, most of the teachers reported incorporating pronunciation teaching into their English classes. The unavailability of pronunciation materials and technological recourses forced the teachers to employ traditional strategies to teaching pronunciation. The findings also showed a lack of specific pronunciation training available to the teachers, though the teachers desired to have more training opportunities.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL teachers|practices|pronunciation|teachers' beliefs|training,2018-07-02T11:31:09.805907,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:16:18.147079,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/citation/,qpbca,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c6vhs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/relationships/node/,c6vhs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45be14b794960011b1c1c5/,5a45be14b794960011b1c1c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpbca/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qpbca/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.26,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qpbca

This study aimed to investigate the effect of tongue twister technique on pronunciation ability of students across different learning styles. This study involved 34 first-year English major students taking Intensive English course at Universitas Lambung Mangkurat, one of leading universities in Indonesia. The students in the experimental group were taught by using tongue twister, while those in the control group were taught by using repetition technique. The students were also grouped based on two types of learning styles, namely active and reflective learning styles referring to Felder and Silverman’s (1988) learning style model. The findings of the study showed that there was no significant difference in pronunciation ability between the groups. No significant difference was either found in pronunciation ability between students with active learning style and those with reflective learning style. In spite of the insignificant results, tongue twister is considered beneficial by the students as they perceived that practicing tongue twisters cultivated joyful learning and it helped them to improve their pronunciation, fluency, and motivation in learning English pronunciation. Tongue twister practice could complement the use of repetition technique to enhance students’ learning experience and learning outcome.",TRUE,FALSE,active|learning styles|pronunciation|reflective|tongue twister,2018-07-02T11:31:09.769281,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:16:47.950767,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/citation/,fce2r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/afkrg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/relationships/node/,afkrg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45bcf8b794960013afc986/,5a45bcf8b794960013afc986,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fce2r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fce2r/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fce2r
