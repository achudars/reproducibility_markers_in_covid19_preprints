copyrights have lined up with the “narrow constructionists,” engaging in
“analytic dissection” of computer programs in order to determine whether
any copyrightable expression has actually been copied. Most commonly, this
analytic dissection has taken the form of the
“abstraction-filtration-comparison” test set forth in Computer Associates
v. Altai. While there are still a few courts in which the “total concept
and feel” approach remains the law, the approach is moribund: since Altai
was decided, no court has endorsed the broader “total concept and feel”
approach.

Rather than ending, the debate over software copyright law appears to be
shifting its focus. Having finally resolved the debate that has been
plaguing software copyright law since its inception, courts are discovering
to their chagrin, that deciding what test to apply actually tells you very
little about how to apply that test. Despite the convergence of courts on
Altai's filtration approach, courts remain fundamentally conflicted in
deciding how broadly to protect software copyright. Further, there remains
a good deal of misunderstanding about what exactly it means to “abstract”
and “filter” a computer program.

I suggest a unified approach to evaluating non-literal infringement in
software copyright cases. This approach focuses on exactly what is alleged
to have been copied. It also acknowledges the increasing role of patent law
in protecting computer software, and the role of other copyright concerns
such as compatibility and fair use. The result of this unified approach is
to provide relatively narrow copyright protection for computer programs in
most cases of non-literal infringement.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:07.838815,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T22:25:34.667000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/citation/,sd7h9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h2xq6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/relationships/node/,h2xq6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c8aae49ad5a101f4f26e16/,57c8aae49ad5a101f4f26e16,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sd7h9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sd7h9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sd7h9

is pretty good evidence that it wasn’t obvious. But the law also says that
if it is obvious to try to make something, and if those who might try would
expect to succeed, making that thing is not patentable. It’s just the
ordinary work we expect of scientists.

These two doctrines can conflict. What if it is obvious to try something,
but actually trying it leads to unexpected results? This actually happens
with some frequency, particularly in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries, where researchers are motivated to try various standard
modifications of known chemicals but where the unpredictability of the art
means that they can expect to be surprised by what they learn from time to
time.

When these two legal doctrines conflict, the doctrine of unexpected results
must give way. Obviousness is based on the idea that we should not give a
patent if ordinary scientists could have gotten to the result without the
encouragement of that patent. If researchers of ordinary skill were already
motivated to try a new variation, and correctly expected that they would
succeed, actually trying the new variation is normal science, not the
extraordinary skill or insight required for invention. And if scientists
would have created the new variation in the ordinary course of their
duties, they would of necessity have stumbled upon the unexpected results.
Normal science, not the incentive of a patent, led them to that course, so
the invention is not patentable.

This result may alarm patent owners in the pharmaceutical industries, who
have been obtaining patents for this sort of normal experimentation for
years. But I think it is required by the Supreme Court’s decision in KSR,
which held that an invention was not patentable if it was obvious to try.
And while pharmaceutical patent owners may lament the loss of these
patents, the rest of the world may not. Patents likely to be affected by
the obvious-to-try rule tend to be follow-on patents used to try to extend
the life of expired patents on new chemical entities, not breakthrough
drugs that require strong protection.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:44.804998,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T22:14:37.205000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/citation/,vb5zm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ggff6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/relationships/node/,ggff6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c8a84eb83f6901e36d8b30/,57c8a84eb83f6901e36d8b30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vb5zm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vb5zm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vb5zm

twenty years have seen the rise of a new business model – the patent troll
– that grew to become a majority of all patent lawsuits. They have seen a
significant expansion in the number of patents granted and a fundamental
change in the industries in which those patents are filed. They have seen
the passage of the most important legislative reform in the last sixty
years, a law that reoriented legal challenges to patents away from courts
and toward the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). And they have seen
remarkable changes in nearly every important legal doctrine, from patent
eligibility to obviousness to infringement to remedies.

These changes have prompted alarm in a number of quarters. From the 1990s
to the 2000s, as the number of patents and patent troll suits skyrocketed,
technology companies and academics worried about the “crisis” in the patent
system – a crisis of overprotection that might interfere with rather than
promote innovation. By 2015, as patent reform took effect and the Supreme
Court undid many of the Federal Circuit’s expansions of patent rights, it
was patent owners who were speaking of a crisis in the patent system – a
crisis of underprotection that might leave innovators without adequate
protection. Depending on one’s perspective, then, the sky seems to have
been falling on the patent system for some time.

Despite the undeniable significance of these changes in both directions,
something curious has happened to the fundamental characteristics of the
patent ecosystem during this period: very little. Whether we look at the
number of patent applications filed, the number of patents issued, the
number of lawsuits filed, the patentee win rate in those lawsuits, or the
market for patent licenses, the data show very little evidence that patent
owners and challengers are behaving differently because of changes in the
law. The patent system, then, seems surprisingly resilient to changes in
the law. This is a puzzle. In this article, I document this phenomenon and
give some thought to why the fundamental characteristics of the patent
system seem resistant to even major changes in patent law and procedure.

reform but for the role of the patent system in society as a whole.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:47.451170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:49:39.851000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/citation/,pe3rh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w5uka/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/relationships/node/,w5uka,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c86a35b83f6901eacd7ee0/,57c86a35b83f6901eacd7ee0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pe3rh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pe3rh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pe3rh

district judges face in patent cases. Many have suggested greater district
court specialization as a solution, and Congress in 2011 enacted
legislation to promote such specialization. In this paper, we investigate
the impact of a novel measure of experience – whether a district court
judge has sat by designation on a Federal Circuit panel in a patent claim
construction appeal – on the likelihood a district judge’s subsequent claim
constructions are reversed. Before sitting by designation, judges who later
do so actually have a slightly higher claim construction reversal rate than
judges who never do so. After sitting by designation, the reversal rate of
district court judges on subsequent claim construction appeals decreases by
50 percent. This decrease is not fully explained by other measures of
experience, including the number of prior patent cases or years on the
bench. Nor is it fully explained by the timing of the appeal, the
particular district court judge or various other characteristics of the
patents, the parties and the litigation. Our results suggest a simple way
to reduce the reversal rate in patent and perhaps other sorts of cases.
However, our evidence suggests this increased agreement is due to increased
Federal Circuit trust in the decisions of individual judges who have sat by
designation and not increased district judge understanding of claim
construction.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:02.615696,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:42:54.155000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/citation/,y8c9z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wpuu3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/relationships/node/,wpuu3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c8689f594d9001e488f8aa/,57c8689f594d9001e488f8aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8c9z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y8c9z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y8c9z

Watson, explains why exclusion-payment settlements, by which brand-name
drug companies pay generic firms to delay entering the market, contravene
the policies of patent law, antitrust law, and the Hatch-Waxman Act. It
addresses five points.

First, the settlements are not consistent with the Hatch-Waxman Act,
Congress’s framework for balancing patent and antitrust law in the
pharmaceutical industry, which encouraged generics to challenge patents.

Second, the settlements are anticompetitive, serving as a form of market
division, which is the practical result when brands pay generics to drop
challenges to weak patents and delay entering the market instead.

Third, the mere fact of a patent cannot justify the payments. The Patent
Office frequently issues invalid patents, and the patents at the heart of
these settlements present concern, often covering not the drug’s active
ingredient but narrower aspects like the formulation or method of use that
are less innovative and bear more potential for anticompetitive mischief.
Patent policy encourages challenges to weak patents, and the procedural
presumption of validity does not justify the settlements.

Fourth, exclusion payments are not needed to settle cases in the public
interest; history has shown that brands and generics can reach settlements
without them.

Fifth, the most appropriate antitrust framework employs a “quick look”
rule-of-reason analysis that treats exclusion payments as presumptively
unlawful. Such a framework recognizes the potentially severe
anticompetitive effects of exclusion-payment settlements while permitting
the settling parties to introduce possible procompetitive justifications,
if any, for their agreement.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:32.500583,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:34:57.852000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/citation/,9c56p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3gvyb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/relationships/node/,3gvyb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c866c3594d9001e488f8a6/,57c866c3594d9001e488f8a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c56p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9c56p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9c56p

which a defendant's use doesn't injure their market directly, but in which
they could and would have charged a fee to grant permission for the use.
Even assuming courts are right to have accepted this argument, it is
unreasonable to then give the copyright owner not just the fee they would
have charged but the power to prevent the use altogether or to collect
damages far in excess of that fee. Licensing market cases are excellent
choices for separating compensation and control, giving copyright owners
the right to get paid without giving them control over transformative uses.
Doing so is harder than simply denying injunctive relief, however. It
requires us to rethink our definition of damages in copyright law with the
aim of remedying injury rather than always seeking to deter infringement.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:19.114671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:32:16.807000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/citation/,4u92a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7mj8x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/relationships/node/,7mj8x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c86623b83f6901e6cd7eec/,57c86623b83f6901e6cd7eec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4u92a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4u92a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4u92a
