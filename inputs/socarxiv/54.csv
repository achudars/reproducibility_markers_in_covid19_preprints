We study how a core strategy of international civil society groups - informing and publicizing human rights abuses - impacts those tied to abuse. Our study focuses on a major trend at the center of on-going international media campaigns: the assassination of civil society activists involved in mining activity. Collecting and coding 20 years of data on assassination events, we use Event Study Methodology to study how publicity of these events impact the asset prices of firms associated with abuse. We show that publicizing abuses has a significant impact on multinationals. Firms associated with an assassination have large, negative abnormal returns following the event. We calculate a median loss in market capitalisation of over 100 million USD, ten days following violence. We highlight the role of media publicity in our results. We show negative returns from assassinations are stronger during periods of low media pressure, versus when they coincide with competing newsworthy events. As well, we argue our results are driven by events where companies are explicitly named in media publicity, using a set of placebo events where no firms were identified by news coverage. Furthermore, we reject that our results are driven by other forms of unrest and conflict.

However, we know surprisingly little about how rankings direct media attention, as well as how media in turn shape and help sustain careers of specific rankings in the public over longer periods of time. To advance our understanding of the discursive dynamics at the intersection of rankings and the press, this study examines the media career of Global Slavery Index by analyzing 361 newspaper and magazine articles, published between the release of index’s inaugural edition in 2013 and until the end of 2019. To interpret the media coverage, the study draws attention to the distinctive properties of the Global Slavery Index, in particular its universality, highly rationalized character, and a pledge to spotlight violation of the global moral order. The longitudinal examination of the media coverage points to the following properties of the index as having shaped and helped sustain its career in the public: (1) repeated publication; (2) broad conceptualization of modern slavery; and the construction thereof as (3) a measurable global burden. These properties further allowed for (a) the construction of countries, organizations, and individuals as morally responsible for the said global burden, as well as for (b) the discursive linking of local and situational concerns with global narratives.",TRUE,FALSE,Global Slavery Index|Media|Rankings|Transnational Governance|Virtue,2020-12-18T21:28:02.216187,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-18T21:27:33.968902,FALSE,NA,no,"320 out of 361 media articles analyzed were retrieved through: https://www.english-corpora.org/now/ (search ""Global Slavery Index""; endpoint: end of 2019).

The study used the 2018 School Workforce Census and related administrative school census datasets to model the distribution of non-White British teachers across English schools. We also conducted 24 narrative interviews with teachers from different ethnic and professional backgrounds working in urban disadvantaged schools to explore factors shaping their decisions to stay in or leave teaching.

While one of the more ‘privileged’ workers who did not lose her job during the crisis, Prachi had to suddenly and swiftly adapt to the practice of ‘work-from-home’. As a neophyte service worker with very limited infrastructure for working at home, Prachi experienced deterioration in her physical and mental health. While working long hours to keep her family afloat during this difficult time, she also had to negotiate the compulsion to participate in housework. Her employers’ distrust and increased surveillance has left her feeling vulnerable, particularly as a woman whose work is not given due recognition in the organisation.

Yet a series of frauds and failed replications have raised questions regarding the frequency and effectiveness of current practices. Metascientific activists have advocated policies that incentivize replications and make them more diagnostically potent. We argue that both current debates and previous research in the social studies of science have overlooked a key dimension of replication practice. Rather than diagnostic tests, replication is commonly motivated by a practical desire to extend research interests. This motivation for replication, which we label “integrative,” is characterized by a pragmatic flexibility toward protocols. The goal is to appropriate what is useful, not test for truth. Within many experimental cultures, however, integrative replications can produce replications of ambiguous diagnostic power. Based on interviews with 60 members of the Board of Reviewing Editors for Science, we show how the interplay between the diagnostic and integrative motives for replication differs between fields and produces different cultures of replication.

A long-term historical view (Barcelona area, 16th-19th centuries)","Parental influence over children’s status attainment has historically been argued to be key. However, the cross-sibling influence has been scarcely studied for historical periods and for steam family societies, being the most long-lasting relationship across individuals’ lives once childhood was surpassed. We investigate how intra-generational family relationships determine the social destiny of siblings taking a long-term perspective (16th and the 19th centuries) for Barcelona and its hinterland, using the unique data compiled in the Barcelona Historical Marriage Database. This region was one of the most dynamic economic area in Southern Europe. We found the emergence of the figure of first-married siblings as determinants in the status attainment of other brothers and sisters and a decline in parental influence from the 18th century onwards for all social groups, denying a sibling competing model. This influence worked differently over time depending on sex. First-born sisters with exogamous marriages had a higher influence than first-married brothers on the social mobility of the rest of siblings along the 16th and 17th century. Conversely, from the 18th century onwards, first-married brothers had a higher ascendancy than first-married sisters. Sibship size and the siblings’ marriage order did not contribute to explain these effects. These results can be interpreted in light of an increase in life expectancy of adult population and a change in the occupational structure due to an early industrialization and in affectivity in the18th century.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperative breeding|cross-sibling influence|family relationships|intra-generational|sibling competition|social mobility|status attainment,2020-12-16T18:53:21.104525,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-16T16:53:29.082426,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,"""Five Centuries of Marriages”  (FP7-ERC-2010-AdG-269796).",2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/citation/,sf6vj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fda064af0df54041c2f0bf1/,5fda064af0df54041c2f0bf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sf6vj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sf6vj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sf6vj,NA

Specifically, we sought to understand actions by universities and instructors that students found effective or ineffective, as well as instructor behaviors that conveyed a sense of caring or not caring about their students’ success. 
Methods: In July 2020 we conducted 16 focus groups with STEM undergraduate students enrolled in US colleges and universities (N=59). Focus groups were stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Thematic analyses were conducted on the data. Results: Participants (N=59; 51% female) were racially/ethnically diverse (76% race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white) and from 32 colleges and universities. The most common effective instructor strategies mentioned included hybrid instruction (35%) and use of multiple tools for learning and student engagement (27%). The most common ineffective strategies mentioned were increasing the course workload or difficulty level (18%) and use of pre-recorded lectures (15%). The most common behaviors cited as making students feel the instructor cared about their success were exhibiting leniency and/or flexibility regarding course policies or assessments (29%) and being responsive and accessible to students (25%). The most common behaviors cited as conveying the instructors did not care included poor communication skills (28%) and increasing the difficulty of the course (15%). University actions students found helpful included flexible policies (41%) and moving key services online (e.g., tutoring, counseling; 24%). Students felt universities should have created policies for faculty and departments to increase consistency (26%) and ensured communication strategies were honest, prompt, and transparent (23%). Conclusions: To be prepared for future emergencies, universities should devise evidence-based policies for remote operations and all instructors should be trained in best practices for remote instruction. Research is needed to identify and ameliorate negative impacts of the pandemic on STEM education.",TRUE,FALSE,distance education|higher education|pandemic|remote learning|STEM education,2020-12-16T18:49:21.910445,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-16T16:52:49.865305,FALSE,NA,no,Contact the authors.
