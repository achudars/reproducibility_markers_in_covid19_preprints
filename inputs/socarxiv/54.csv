So why do anticorruption drives often increase political and administrative chaos, instead of decreasing it? In this paper I address this puzzle by analysing the simultaneous effects of judicial anticorruption on both the legislative and judicial spheres. Using the case of Romania from 2005 to 2020, I first demonstrate that the successful drive to jail corruption politicians has increased legislative instability by causing waves of party switching, thereby perforating the political opportunity structure and making space for new, populist political parties. I then show how the new structures of judicial anticorruption have fractured the career lines of judges and prosecutors, while at the same time giving magistrates a reason to weaponise their growing professional heterogeneity as they struggle for control over the new and scarce professional resources brought by the anticorruption drive. This increasing complexity in both legislative and judicial spheres results in ever-growing discursive commitment to rule-following coupled with a decreasing ability to actually follow those rules as the set of veto players becomes increasingly unstable, an outcome that, following institutional theorists in sociology, I term “decoupled rationalisation.”",TRUE,FALSE,anticorruption|judiciary|legislative party switching|rationalisation|Romania,2021-03-23T12:05:42.230966,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-23T12:04:55.414275,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/gfjke/|https://osf.io/aem6y/,no,"Exploratory analysis, no preregistration possible.",,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/citation/,d2rju,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6058b58fc402cc01e4978ccd/,6058b58fc402cc01e4978ccd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2rju/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d2rju/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d2rju

This survey was available online between April and June of 2020 and was open to SAA members and non-members. Consisting of 31 questions, the survey received responses from 1,542 people (including 1,112 SAA members). A key objective was to gauge reactions and attitudes of respondents toward the current SAA Principles of Archaeological Ethics. This article reports the survey results relevant to those principles, which can be found at https://www.saa.org/career-practice/ethics-in-professional-archaeology and which are reprinted in this issue of the Record. We first summarize the respondents’ demographics, and how they are using the principles.

We document three secular changes that weaken this channel: (i) labor's share of value added in investment goods production has declined, (ii) the import share of investment goods has risen, and (iii) the composition of investment has shifted towards components that are less responsive to monetary policy.

Emergent Properties of Business Gamification Elements in the Digital Economy,"Organisations are currently lacking in developing and implementing business systems in meaningful ways to motivate and engage their staff. This is particularly salient as the average employee spends eleven cumulative years of their life at work, however less than one third of the workforce are actually engaged in their duties throughout their career. Such low levels of engagement are particularly prominent with younger employees, referred to as Generation Y (GenY), who are the least engaged of all groups at work. However, they will dedicate around five cumulative years of their life immersed playing video games such as ‘Clash of Clans’, whether for social, competitive, extrinsic, or intrinsic motivational factors. 

Using behavioural concepts derived from video games, and applying game design elements in business systems to motivate employees in the digital economy, is a concept which has come to be recognised as Business Gamification. Thus, the purpose of this research paper is to further our understanding of game design elements for business, and investigate their properties from design to implementation in gamified systems. Following a two-year ethnographic style study with both a system development, and a communication agency largely staffed with GenY employees, findings suggest properties in game design elements are emergent and temporal in their instantiations",TRUE,FALSE,Business Gamification|Clash of Clans|Digital Economy|Employee|Engagement|Enterprise Gamification|Gamification|Gen Y|Leaderboard|Millennials|Motivation|Self-Continuity|Staff|Workforce,2021-03-22T02:05:41.359060,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-22T02:05:20.674037,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/citation/,6twyn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6057ce0ee8afef01d45faaa0/,6057ce0ee8afef01d45faaa0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6twyn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6twyn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6twyn

Many scholars have discussed the normative question of why philanthropy might or might not be desirable in a democracy. However, few have paused to address the prior and more fundamental analytical question of what makes philanthropy inherently specific in such a way that may (or may not) raise compatibility issues with the distinguishing features of democracy. I address this question as I offer a characterization of philanthropy as an act carrying a plutocratic and third-personal form of authority, which is in contrast with the mutual and second-personal kind of authority that distinguishes democracy as a form of government. The source of philanthropy’s authority rests in some people’s material resources that can be used to further unilateral decisions based on their individual preferences. This distinguishing feature of philanthropy makes it prima facie incompatible with the logic of democratic authority, which rests in the relations of mutual accountability between citizens as the joint makers of collective decisions. Philanthropy, I argue, inherently betrays this logic because it establishes no specific relation of mutual accountability between the donor and the recipient of the gift. To understand this specificity of philanthropy is important to gain a better understanding of the merits and limits of the different normative proposals to assess the desirability of making space for philanthropy in a democracy.",TRUE,FALSE,Authority|Decision-making|Democracy|Foundation|Nonprofit sector|Philanthropy|Plutocracy|Political philosophy|Political Theory|Power|Tax incentive|Third-personality,2021-03-22T02:00:26.486973,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-22T02:00:12.835888,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,Matthieu Debief,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/citation/,gj5nf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605733b8e8afef01b45f3a4c/,605733b8e8afef01b45f3a4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj5nf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gj5nf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gj5nf

Utilizing  the  GARCH  augmented  feedback  model,  or  the exchange rate model set out by Laopodis (2005), the author analyzes autocorrelation in exchange rate parameters and volatility in key ASEAN markets to yield the deeper understanding of momentum periods. The authors  contend  that  positive  feedback  traders  affect  exchange  rate volatility in ASEAN countries and induce the autocorrelation of negative returns  within  high  exchange  rate  volatility.  This  study  found  that Singapore demonstrated a significant positive feedback trading during the period  1995-2014,  while  the  authors  further  contend  that  Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, and Singapore also demonstrated positive feedback trading during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. In addition to analyzing the positive feedback trading on exchange rate volatility, we also identify the exchange rate volatility spillover across the ASEAN countries. Related to this context, we found that Indonesia and Thailand play a dominant role as a dominant exchange rate volatility transmitter in the ASEAN region.",TRUE,FALSE,|feedback trading|volatility,2021-03-22T01:57:21.943551,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-22T01:57:13.318744,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2F7fvm8%2Fdownload,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/citation/,yx8re,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60564191c402cc015397bb11/,60564191c402cc015397bb11,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx8re/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yx8re/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yx8re

By examining twelve potential behavioral determinants this Barrier Analysis study was conducted to identify the barriers and enablers of HWWS after defecation in urban setting in Bangladesh. We conducted 45 interviews with those who washed their hands with soap after defecation (“Doers”) and another 45 interviews with those who did not (“Non-doers”). Data analysis was performed to identify which beliefs were most highly-associated with hand washing with soap. The analysis showed that two of the main barriers of HWWS after defecation were related to perceived self-efficacy and access, especially availability of soap.  Non-doers claimed that access to soap was difficult due to lack of money and unavailability at nearby shops. Other important determinants such as difficulty remembering to buy soap (cues for action)), believing that most people did not approve of HWWS (e.g. perceived social norms), low perceived severity of diarrhea, and not believing that HWWS would work to reduce diarrhea (perceived action efficacy) were significantly correlated with adoption of the behavior.  Perceived divine will (believing that it is God’s will when one gets diarrhea) was also a factor among the Non-doers.  Other benefits such as feeling clean and keeping free from illness were reported more often by Doers, while Non-doers were more likely to report increased costs as a barrier to HWWS. The results suggest that an integrated behavior change strategy promoting specific beliefs about HWWS using culturally-inclusive messaging and activities to address the different barriers and leverage the different enablers may lead to better adoption of HWWS.",TRUE,FALSE,Bangladesh|Barrier Analysis|Behavioral Deteriminants|Behavior Change|Dhaka|Handwashing with soap|Hygiene and Sanitation|WASH,2021-03-21T00:37:27.436046,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-21T00:37:03.369577,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rLzPP-NuBauzK_L9FCassMARaKoS9z6y/view?usp=sharing,no,This study was not preregistered.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/citation/,j6c2a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60561291c402cc014297b114/,60561291c402cc014297b114,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j6c2a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j6c2a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j6c2a
