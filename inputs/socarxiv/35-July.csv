Relations between sex and age gradients are explored analytically based upon the proposed log-polynomial regression model of COVID-19 mortality. This model enables predicting mortality risk at any arbitrary age, as well as the derivation of several useful secondary metrics:
•	Sex differential: a ratio of male-to-female death risks for a given age group.
•	Age parity: age at which both sexes have an equal vulnerability.
•	Age lag: the number of years to subtract from a male’s age to match a female’s death risk.
•	Male equal risk age: male’s age at which male’s odds of dying from COVID-19 will equate female’s given the cutoff age.
 
These metrics allow solving such practical problems as, e.g., prioritizing vaccine based on COVID-19 mortality risk associated with sex and age.

The Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA) has been recently adopted to support international statistical comparability, but its rigid criteria for classify areas as urban/non-urban based upon fixed population size and density criteria is controversial. Here we present an alternative approach to urban classification, using a flexible range of population density \&amp; count thresholds. We then compare how these thresholds affect estimation of urbanization and urban settlement counts across three of the most popular gridded population datasets (GPD). Instead of introducing further uncertainties by matching GPD to built-up area datasets, we classify urban areas in a purely spatial demographic way. By calculating national urban shares and urban area counts, we highlight the often overlooked uncertainties when using GPD. We find that the choice of GPD is generally the dominant factor in altering both of these urban indicators but the choice of urban criteria is also important. Overall, this alternative urban classification method offers a more flexible approach to human settlements classification that can be applied globally for comparative research.",TRUE,FALSE,identifying urban areas|urban areas|urbanization,2021-05-31T01:35:15.581618,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-31T01:34:40.768658,FALSE,NA,no,Data available on request,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,Thomas Adam Statham|Sean Fox|Levi John Wolf,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/citation/,abvc6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3mgcs/,3mgcs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b3fd429096b7010364663e/,60b3fd429096b7010364663e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/abvc6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/abvc6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/abvc6,NA

Despite its prevalence, it remains insufficiently theorised in certain context. One such context is crowdsourcing, which has been proposed as a way to resolve so called ‘wicked’ problems. Crowdsourcing has tended to hold implicit ra-tional and universal epistemologies: the more participation the better. Us-ing resourcing theory, we look at a civic platform implemented with the ambitions to change social relations within the city of Madrid. We propose a processual view of participation which evolves in time taking and being given different qualities as schemas are enacted and resources created. The platform we analyse was supposed to engage citizens to become par-ticipative members of society in the definition of public policies. When this does not occur, alternative resources are designed to palliate the deficien-cies of the platform.

Promise Theory offers a simple formalized understanding of authority, and its origins, as polarization within  a network of collaborative interactions.  This idealized  approximation stands in contrast to the usual deontic view of  authority in socio-philosophical literature, and unifies the various  interpretations with a single idea.  It's shown that the elementary  meanings of authority can all be understood as a promise, analogous  to that of a `compass direction' within some decision space, with  which agents may choose to align voluntarily. Authority is therefore  separated from the embodiment by any particular agency or kind of agent, and is closely related to the concept of leadership in  management science.  Agents may try to impose authoritative  directives onto subordinates, but imposition will generally be  ineffective, due to their autonomy or causal independence. Stable  configurations may be formed from resonant interactions that employ both semantics and dynamics to bind agents.  This simple-minded formalization serves as an foundation for later study about the dynamics of authority and derived `power'.",TRUE,FALSE,Authority|Formal sociology|Promise Theory,2021-06-02T19:46:02.000122,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-02T19:44:45.227367,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Mark Burgess,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/citation/,8c54d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/etprv/,etprv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b24fba3a6df100d2d50ccc/,60b24fba3a6df100d2d50ccc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c54d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8c54d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8c54d,https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.26374.70728

This proposition ignited demonstrations initially against the proposition itself, and later against the Hong Kong government and Chief Executive, Carrie Lam. Since then, millions of protesters have been demonstrating for the political independence of Hong Kong. During these demonstrations, the use of objects and technologies by protesters in their confrontation with local authorities and surveillance devices have been especially highlighted by news media. Through an actor-network analysis, we examine how the presence of surveillance influences the central human and non-human actors of the protest. We deploy a theoretical and methodological approach based on a synthesis between actor-network theory and visual sociology. Our empirical foundation for this analysis is 83 photographs that serve as second-hand insight into the protest situation. Through this qualitative analysis, we illuminate the role of non-human actors in the Hong Kong protests. Also, how the context of protesting in a surveillance state influences the way the networks of the protests are organized. The analytical results point to relations of surveillance and counter-surveillance strategies as central connections between actors in the protest networks.

They have provided many forms of support, in particular grocery shopping which has enabled people to self-isolate if required. While community solidarity during emergencies and disasters is common, previous studies have shown that such solidarity behaviours tend to decline over time, even when needs remain high. In this study, we address how mutual aid groups can be sustained over time in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 32 interviews with organisers of COVID-19 mutual aid and community support groups in the UK between September 2020 and January 2021. Our reflexive thematic analysis shows that several community and group level experiences and strategies were related to sustained participation in COVID-19 mutual aid groups. Meeting community needs over time with localised action and resources and building trust and community-based alliances were foundational elements in the COVID-19 mutual aid groups. Group processes strategies, such as a culture of care and support or regular group meetings, were key strategies that helped to sustain involvement. The experiences resulting from participation in COVID-19 mutual aid groups were also related to sustained participation, as they led to positive emotions (e.g., joy, pride), well-being and efficacy. Finally, participation in COVID-19 mutual aid was also related to an increasing sense of local community belonging and cohesion. Based on these findings, we propose four practical recommendations for sustaining mutual aid groups in order to assist public engagement with protective behaviours in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. We recommend providing practical and financial support to COVID-19 mutual aid groups; to mobilise the knowledge and the experiences acquired by COVID-19 mutual aid groups for developing programmes and interventions for addressing the medium and long-term impacts of COVID-19; to prioritise community-level interventions; and to recognise the role of group processes as they have the potential to lead to long-term community responses.

Using a vignette version of the trust game, we addressed the role that social standing plays in estimating trustworthiness of strangers in cross-status interactions in Chile, a non-WEIRD context also characterized by high inequality and social segregation. We found no relationship between the socioeconomic status of trustors and trusting behavior. However, trustees’ income was the most important attribute for trustors to decide how much to trust. We also found that higher-income trustees are less trusted in general, particularly by lower-status trustors. Finally, the results revealed that the influence of income differences on trust was higher for lower-status participants: they are more trustful of others of similar status. We did not observe a similar effect of ingroup favoritism on trust among higher-status participants. These results suggest that income differences are decisive in the trust decisions of lower-status individuals.",TRUE,FALSE,pro-social behavior|socioeconomic status|trust|vignette experiments,2021-05-29T22:53:23.038198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-29T22:53:14.156700,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/citation/,q9up3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b110d03a6df10064d4d8aa/,60b110d03a6df10064d4d8aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9up3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q9up3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q9up3,NA

The emergence of the “entrepreneurial university” has brought increasing differentiation of the work roles of academics in addition to increased mobility and, for some, precarity. At the same time, researchers are dealing with unprecedented amounts of data. The present article describes how policies and infrastructures implemented to support researchers with data curation tasks might be repurposed by research administrators to tackle problems of academic mobility rooted in increasing precarity of non-tenured research staff. Findings suggest that the organizational benefit of research data management (RDM) is not increased efficiency or reusability of research, but rather increased control over data left behind by non-tenured staff. Recent interest in data mobility needs to be understood by reference to increased researcher mobility. While the view of data as context-independent evidence has been challenged by reference to the investments necessary to mobilize data as evidence in the first place, the material presented here suggests that RDM is repurposed by universities as a strategy to manage, not data, but rather increasing rates of staff turnover. The mobility of data producers and the immobility of data are frequently in tension. Handing over data is problematic irrespective of domain, data type, and funding source. The term “high-throughput university” is introduced in opposition to “high-throughput” data production techniques to suggest that findability and reusability of data need to be recontextualized with reference to increased academic mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Capitalism|Data Journeys|Mobility|Research Data Management,2021-05-29T22:52:46.111495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-29T22:52:26.542704,FALSE,NA,no,"The paper is based on interviews with scientists and engineers.

These schemes have been propelled to paradigms for research on social mobility and educational inequalities and applied in cross-national research for both genders. Using the European Working Conditions Survey, we examine their criterion and construct validity across 31 countries and for both genders. We investigate whether classes are well-delineated by the theoretically assumed dimensions of employment relations and we assess how several measures of occupational advantage differ across classes. We find broad similarity in the criterion validity of EGP and ESEC across genders and countries as well as satisfactory levels of construct validity. However, the salariat classes are too heterogeneous and their boundaries with the intermediate classes are blurred. To improve the measurement of social class, we propose to differentiate managerial and professional occupations within the lower and higher salariat respectively. We show that implementing these distinctions in ESEC and EGP improves their criterion validity and allows to better identify privileged positions.",TRUE,FALSE,EGP|European Socio-Economic Schema (ESeC)|Measurement|social class|Stratification,2021-05-29T22:51:27.666101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-29T22:51:01.258116,FALSE,NA,no,The European Working Conditions Survey is publicly available however the version with 3-digit ISCO codes we use in the paper requires a confidentiality agreement.
