Lovis","This volume is collection of papers emerging from a forum at the 2014 SAA meetings. The papers are motivated by the question of how we can measure and interpret uncertainty in quantitative archaeological models, specifically by using sensitivity analysis. The types of models discussed in this volume include geo-referenced models of past environments to infer hunter-gather land use, and agent-based models of cultural transmission processes. They explore various sources of uncertainty, and implement sensitivity analysis by assessing how the output of the models varies according to changes in the inputs. The motivation for this collection is the editors' observations that archaeologists lack a discipline-based protocol for testing models.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|modeling|sensitivity analysis|uncertainty,2018-07-02T11:15:47.926323,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-11T18:12:37.112152,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/citation/,v5du3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d9wkp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/relationships/node/,d9wkp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59de5ead9ad5a102b4871a57/,59de5ead9ad5a102b4871a57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v5du3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v5du3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v5du3,NA

Data-activism in Italian and Spanish anti-corruption campaigns,"This article investigates how activists employ Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and engage with data-activism in grassroots struggles against corruption. Based on a comparative research design that triangulates three qualitative data sources — in-depth interviews, movements’ documents and participatory platforms — the article analyses two campaigns: Riparte il Futuro in Italy and 15MpaRato in Spain. In so doing, the article casts light on how activists engage with digital data, revealing how their employment is connected to and consistent with the type of organizational structure and communication strategy of the campaign. Moreover, the article evaluates how activists engage with three specific digital data-related practices — digital data creation, data usage and data transformation.

Research demonstrates a link between aggregate unemployment and employed individuals’ perceptions of job insecurity; however, less is known about whether the stress associated with these perceptions is shaped by others’ unemployment experiences. We analyze a nationally representative sample of Canadian workers (Canadian Work, Stress, and Health study; N = 3,900) linked to census data and test whether regional unemployment influences the mental health consequences of job insecurity. Multilevel analyses provide more support for the social norm of insecurity hypothesis over the amplified threat hypothesis: the health penalties of job insecurity are weaker for individuals in high-unemployment regions. This contingency is partially explained by the ability of insecure workers in poor labor market contexts to retain psychological resources important for protecting mental health",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:15:47.045610,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-11T01:45:04.673605,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/citation/,d2e7u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xq6hv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/relationships/node/,xq6hv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59dd7749b83f6902b104bde4/,59dd7749b83f6902b104bde4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2e7u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d2e7u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d2e7u,NA

We find that the majority of people in our experiment do not exhibit loss aversion bias and that several people exhibit an opposite bias we call “turtling.” Turtlers prefer smaller certain options when choices are framed as losses and larger uncertain options when they are framed as gains.

This was not an isolated case. Proactive monitoring and filtering found their way in the legal system as a privileged enforcement strategy through legislation, judicial decisions and private ordering. In multiple jurisdictions, recent case law has imposed proactive monitor obligations on intermediaries. These cases uphold proactive monitoring across the entire spectrum of intermediary liability subject matters: intellectual property, privacy, defamation, and hate/dangerous speech. In this context, however, notable exceptions—such as the landmark Belen case in Argentina—highlight also a fragmented international response. Legislative proposals have been following suit. As part of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Commission, would like to introduce filtering obligations for intermediaries to close a “value gap” between rightholders and online platforms allegedly exploiting protected content. In addition, proactive monitoring and filtering obligations would also feature in an update of the European audio-visual media legislation. Meanwhile, online platforms have already set up miscellaneous filtering schemes on a voluntary basis.

In this paper, I suggest that we are witnessing the death of “no monitoring obligations,” a well-marked trend in intermediary liability policy. Current Internet policy—especially in Europe—is silently drifting away from a fundamental safeguard for freedom of expression online. In this respect, this paper would like to contextualize this trend within the emergence of a broader move towards private enforcement online. The EU Digital Single Market Strategy apparently endorsed voluntary measures as a privileged tool to curb illicit and infringing activities online. As I argued elsewhere, the intermediary liability discourse is shifting towards an intermediary responsibility discourse. This process might be pushing an amorphous notion of responsibility that incentivizes intermediaries’ self-intervention.

From Intermediary Liability to Responsibility,"Since the enactment of the first safe harbours and liability exemptions for online intermediaries, market conditions have radically changed. Originally, intermediary liability exemptions were introduced to promote an emerging Internet market. Do safe harbours for online intermediaries still serve innovation? Should they be limited or expanded? These critical questions—often tainted by protectionist concerns—define the present intermediary liability conundrum. In this context, this paper would like to explain the recent developments in intermediary liability theory and policy within a broader move towards private ordering online. Public enforcement lacking technical knowledge and resources to address an unprecedented challenge in terms of global human semiotic behaviour would coactively outsource enforcement online to private parties.

Online intermediaries’ governance would move away from a well-established utilitarian approach and toward a moral approach by rejecting negligence-based intermediary liability arrangements. Miscellaneous policy tools—such as monitoring and filtering obligations, blocking orders, graduated response, payment blockades and follow-the-money strategies, private DNS content regulation, online search manipulation, or administrative enforcement—might reflect this change in perspective. In particular, governments—and interested third-parties such as intellectual property rightholders—try to coerce online intermediaries into implementing these policy strategies through voluntary measures and self-regulation, in addition to validly enacted obligations. This process might be pushing an amorphous notion of responsibility that incentivizes intermediaries’ self-intervention to police allegedly infringing activities in the Internet. In this sense, the intermediary liability discourse is shifting towards an intermediary responsibility discourse.

Further, enforcement would be looking once again for an ‘answer to the machine in the machine’. By enlisting online intermediaries as watchdogs, governments would de facto delegate online enforcement to algorithmic tools. Due process and fundamental guarantees get mauled by technological enforcement, curbing fair uses of content online and silencing speech according to the mainstream ethical discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,Copyright|Defamation|Hate Speech|Intellectual Property|Intermediary Liability|Internet|Online Platform|Private Ordering,2018-07-02T11:15:44.898789,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-09T15:01:32.347090,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/citation/,t6ryb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/39rka/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/relationships/node/,39rka,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59db8eb8594d9002c699d4ef/,59db8eb8594d9002c699d4ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ryb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t6ryb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t6ryb,NA

Therefore, intermediaries have become a main focus of privacy regulations, especially in jurisdictions with a strong tradition of privacy protection such as Europe. In a landmark case, the ECJ ruled that an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties. The recognition by the European Union of a so called “right to be forgotten” (RTBF) has ignited disgruntled reactions from civil society and legal scholars, especially in the United States. Meanwhile, proposals for the adoption of a similar right have appeared in several jurisdictions, including Brazil, Japan, Korea, and Russia. Supposedly, the right to be forgotten would endanger freedom of expression (FoE) and access to information. Apparently, factoids — defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “an item of unreliable information that is reported and repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact” — dominated the recent debate surrounding the right to be forgotten. This paper will discuss and debunk these factoids, review data protection legislation in Europe, and explore the legal and policy implications of the newly emerging right to be forgotten. Finally, the idea that extra-territorial application of the RTBF might unleash a kraken that can break down the Internet will be contextualized within the present political scenario. The extra-territorial application of the RTBF follows in the footsteps of a global move towards data protectionism against the de facto market dominance of US Internet conglomerates. Global blocking governed by a nationality principle — as suggested by CNiL and other EU institutions — would put to rest these protectionist concerns.",TRUE,FALSE,Data Protection|EU|European Law|Factoids|Intermediary Liability|Internet|Memory|Privacy|Right to Be Forgotten,2018-07-02T11:14:59.068288,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-09T02:55:53.668537,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3a|Law|Civil Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3e|Law|Constitutional Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/citation/,f7cqj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fz8a2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/relationships/node/,fz8a2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59dae47f9ad5a102b49b933c/,59dae47f9ad5a102b49b933c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f7cqj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f7cqj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f7cqj,NA
