This article takes Kenyan youth music under the influence of global hip-hop as an ethnographic entry into the dynamics of identity and citizenship in this region. Kenyan youth music borrows from global hip-hop culture the idea that an artist must ‘represent the real’. The ways in which these regional artists construct their public personae thus provide rich data on ‘cultural citizenship’, in Aihwa Ong’s (1996) sense of citizenship as subjectification. I focus here on youth music production in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa between 2004 and 2007. During this time, some local artists adopted a representational strategy that subtly reinscribed the symbolic violence to which members of the coast’s Muslim-Swahili society have long been subjected. I examine the representational strategies that were adopted during this period by Mombasan artists who happened to be members of the Muslim- Swahili society (‘subjects of the Swahili coast’, as I name them), with an ethnographic eye and ear trained on what they say about the ways in which young subjects of the Swahili coast are objectified and subjectified as ‘Kenyan youth’ in the twenty-first century.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Citizenship|Hip Hop|Swahili Coast,2018-07-02T10:53:49.860621,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-16T01:14:41.734000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d46|Arts and Humanities|Music|Ethnomusicology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/citation/,ww8cj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/523rh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/relationships/node/,523rh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a4fc6c6c613b01f1ead09d/,58a4fc6c6c613b01f1ead09d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ww8cj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ww8cj/,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0001972012000502,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ww8cj

This article examines the purpose behind, and rhetorical content of, political wall murals produced during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. I utilize a semiotic approach to analyze the ways that the symbolic content and physical placement of Northern Irish murals were used by actors on both sides of the conflict. I examine the major thematic traditions utilized by muralists on each side and situate them within the historical and political contexts of the conflict in Northern Ireland. This approach highlights the ways that murals did more than simply champion ideological causes, as earlier scholarship has argued, but served an active role in efforts to catalyze cultural support for organizations' political goals. I argue that murals played a key role for organizations on both sides of the conflict, as they each struggled to craft a communal self-identification and legitimizing central narrative that furthered their ideological goals. Organizations on both sides used murals to mobilize cultural support for their political and military struggles. In this regard, murals functioned as a form of mythic speech, attempting to depoliticize highly political ideologies and make the rhetoric used by the competing groups seem natural and pure. The grassroots nature of the mural traditions is particularly telling in this regard, exposing the deep-seated insecurity of organizations on both sides. This insecurity is further reflected by, and served as a catalyst for, the paramilitary violence that was a defining characteristic of Northern Ireland for so long.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Politics|Murals|Nationalism|Northern Ireland|Political Propaganda,2018-07-02T10:45:18.761145,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-15T21:40:53.056000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c92|Arts and Humanities|European Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce2|Arts and Humanities|History|Political History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d32|Arts and Humanities|Celtic Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/citation/,4mqjb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3zzym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/relationships/node/,3zzym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a4c9289ad5a101f7b253fc/,58a4c9289ad5a101f7b253fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4mqjb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4mqjb/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10767-013-9142-y,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4mqjb

The key concept—energized crowding—refers to the social effects of large numbers of social interactions that take place within settlements. Demographic processes of population growth and settlement nucleation (aggregation and urbanization) lead to increased energized crowding, which in turn generates a variety of social outcomes. I discuss those outcomes under three headings: scalar stress, community formation, and economic growth. In this model, aggregation and urbanization are crucial processes that lead—by way of energized crowding—to many documented social outputs in both contemporary and past settlement systems. Because this is a new approach for archaeology, conceptual tools for understanding these processes must be borrowed from other social sciences. In particular, recent research on settlement scaling provides empirical and theoretical support for the notion that aggregation and urbanization were of fundamental importance in generating social change in the past.",TRUE,FALSE,cities|generative social processes|settlement aggregation|urban scaling,2018-07-02T10:46:24.021722,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-15T20:03:05.619000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/citation/,5acfw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qa3jr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/relationships/node/,qa3jr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a4b350b83f6901efc99ada/,58a4b350b83f6901efc99ada,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5acfw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5acfw/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5acfw

In this paper, we attempt to answer this key question by suggesting that there is a place for cities in the way we coordinate seemingly chaotic decisions. We look into the elementary processes of social interaction exploring a particular concept, “social entropy,” or how social systems deal with uncertainty and unpredictability in the transition from individual actions to systems of interaction. Examining possibilities that (i) actions rely on informational differences latent in their environments and that (ii) the city itself is an information environment to actions, we propose that (iii) space becomes a form of creating differences in the probabilities of interaction. We investigate this process through simulations of distinct material scenarios, to find that space is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the reduction of entropy. Finally, we suggest that states and fluctuations of entropy are a vital part of social reproduction and reveal a deep connection between social, informational, and spatial systems.",TRUE,FALSE,city|entropy|information|social action|social organisation|space,2018-07-02T10:51:08.114489,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-15T18:16:40.400000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/citation/,kdfkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zzb2a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/relationships/node/,zzb2a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a497c8594d9001f1f52b78/,58a497c8594d9001f1f52b78,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kdfkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kdfkt/,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/6182503,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kdfkt

The existence of musical universals has implications for diverse areas, such as evolution, aesthetics, and cross-cultural understanding, and has thus been a major focus of debate in ethnomusicology and related disciplines. For reasons of space and expertise, this article focuses on debates about musical universals in the mainstream ethnomusicological canon and their broader connections with concepts of human universals in the Western academic tradition, without intending to diminish the value of alternative approaches developed outside of these traditions. Scale tunings and other aspects of pitch structure were long assumed to be universal. During the 20th century, ethnomusicology embraced relativism, emphasizing cross-cultural differences in musical meaning and behavior. However, a 21st century renewal of interest by music psychologists has seen a return to an empirical middle-ground that seeks to move beyond universal/relative dichotomies. Instead, recent research attempts to characterize the degrees to which different aspects of music are more or less common cross-culturally, and to understand the biological and cultural factors underlying this spectrum. Existing evidence suggests a statistically universal set of basic building blocks that may reflect pan-human biological constraints, but each culture may combine and develop these building blocks in unique ways to construct music that can mean different things to different listeners.",TRUE,FALSE,anthropology|comparative musicology|ethnomusicology|music|psychology,2018-07-02T10:53:48.860043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-15T06:33:26.925000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d43|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d46|Arts and Humanities|Music|Ethnomusicology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/citation/,wn8gu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9g5wd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/relationships/node/,9g5wd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a3f5cd9ad5a101f9a2e52f/,58a3f5cd9ad5a101f9a2e52f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn8gu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wn8gu/,https://doi.org/10.4135/9781483317731.n759,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wn8gu

Data published by The Washington Post is merged with data collected by the author regarding how encounters were initiated. Descriptive analysis and basic statistical analysis is performed and the results indicate that how police contact was initiated varies by race/ethnicity, age, sex, mental health status, and whether (or how) the individual killed by police was armed with a weapon. The implications of the results for understanding police use of force are discussed. This paper recommends that databases on civilian fatalities include information on how contact was initiated. Without this crucial information, understandings of police use of force are incomplete.",TRUE,FALSE,Mental Health|Police|Race/ethnicity,2018-07-02T10:51:06.444555,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-14T00:59:45.130000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/citation/,jsg5h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7z2rb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/relationships/node/,7z2rb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a255806c613b01f0990b7b/,58a255806c613b01f0990b7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jsg5h/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jsg5h

The use of this tobacco snuff—referred to in Tzotzil Maya as “angel” (anjel), “elder brother” (bankilal), “great old man” (muk’ta mol), or simply “tobacco” (moy)—appears to date back to the Classic Maya, and represents continuity in Mayan tobacco culture spanning more than a thousand years. Despite the central importance of this plant in highland Maya medicine and ritual, its use has not previously been documented in any systematic manner. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to present a comprehensive overview of traditional highland Maya tobacco culture among the contemporary Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya of highland Chiapas, exploring the cultural significance in this quintessentially Amerindian plant in the domains of ethnomedicine, ritual, folklore, and mythology.",TRUE,FALSE,Ancient Maya|ethnobotany|ethnomedicine|Highland Maya|Maya|Nicotiana|oral snuff|tobacco|Tzeltal|Tzotzil,2018-07-02T10:49:04.186541,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-13T18:33:36.747000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/citation/,eh2yp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yvxj7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/relationships/node/,yvxj7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a1fb499ad5a101f53cd93e/,58a1fb499ad5a101f53cd93e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eh2yp/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eh2yp

Smart city technologies are promoted as an effective way to counter and manage uncertainty and urban risks through the effective and efficient delivery of services, yet paradoxically they create new vulnerabilities and threats, including making city infrastructure and services insecure, brittle, and open to extended forms of criminal activity. This paradox has largely been ignored or underestimated by commercial and governmental interests or tackled through a technically-mediated mitigation approach. We identify five forms of vulnerabilities with respect to smart city technologies, detail the present extent of cyberattacks on networked infrastructure and services, and present a number of illustrative examples. We then adopt a normative approach to explore existing mitigation strategies, suggesting a wider set of systemic interventions (including security-by-design, remedial security patching and replacement, formation of core security and computer emergency response teams, a change in procurement procedures, and continuing professional development). We discuss how this approach might be enacted and enforced through market-led and regulation/management measures, and examine a more radical preventative approach to security.",TRUE,FALSE,|crime|cyberattacks|mitigation|risk|security|smart cities|urban resilience,2018-07-02T10:49:06.383730,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-13T10:02:15.451000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/citation/,f6z63,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cg5ca/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/relationships/node/,cg5ca,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a18310594d9001fb121474/,58a18310594d9001fb121474,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6z63/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6z63/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6z63
