The events mentioned above have pulled the trigger of interest to the term in international scholarly world. Ukraine was not an exception in this situation. Having suffered through the consequences of post-truth practical application, Ukrainians have much to say on the matter of post-truth description and on the matter of dealing with it. My specific interest concerned the area of law, and this article focuses on the role post-truth plays in legal fields. I go over the basic ideas of post-truth, analyze its origin and influence, as well as provide examples of its legal application in Ukrainian environment. ZVIERIEV, Ievgen.

Although recently the relations started to improve, the main international agreement between Belarus and the EU is still the one concluded by the Soviet Union. Even though there are plans on changing the situation and concluding a new international framework agreement with the EU, it is clear that Eurasian integration is of primary importance for Belarus. This article focuses on analyzing the legal basis of the EU-Belarus relations, effect that international contractual obligations have in the domestic legal order, and the way membership to the Eurasian Economic Union influences that. It is argued that new contractual legal framework between Belarus and the EU is imaginable, although it would be limited, among others, due to transfer of certain exclusive competences to the supranational level of the Eurasian Economic Union.

Representative surveys consistently find dramatically decreasing levels of sexual prejudice among all groups, among men and young men in particular. Qualitative scholarship, however, continues to find that enactments of homophobia remain integral components of contemporary masculine identities. In this article, we make sense of this shift and apparent methodological inconsistency. We do not question which measure is best. Instead, we argue for a need to understand the ways that gendered sexual prejudice transforms in ways that allow the relationship between masculinity and homophobia to endure—sometimes even when it appears to be in decline.",TRUE,FALSE,hegemonic masculinity|homophobia|masculinities|masculinity|sexual prejudice,2019-08-09T21:42:31.087393,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T21:42:07.299994,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Sage Publications,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/citation/,4vd8f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4b202d0f488d00188f528c/,5d4b202d0f488d00188f528c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4vd8f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4vd8f/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4vd8f

Library of Porto, held on the 24th November 1945, sets the motto for the construction of
a historically and sociologically based analysis of the modes of usage of public and semi-
public space – namely libraries – used by women and their meanings in those days.
Within the framework of a qualitative approach, sources such as literature, photography
and personal interviews are added to documentary data from institutional archives. A
fictional narrative, built from historical data, is inserted to sustain our analysis, where
Adozinda is the character embodying a woman reader who crosses the city to visit the
recently inaugurated Feminine Reading Room. Two female figures punctuate this narrative,
Virgínia de Castro e Almeida, the person after whom this room was named, and Tília Dulce
Machado Martins, the main legator of the collection it holds. Using this fictional narrative,
we aimed at reconstructing a holistic context for the facts as they might have happened
through a pleasurable reading of a plausible text. These women’s diverse histories are
also inserted in that context.
Fiction is a resource used to inscribe data on the social, economic, and political situation
in the city and in the country at that time, with an emphasis on women and their uses of
public space.
As to the theoretical framing of public and semi-public use of the space, the theory of
gendered spaces, as opposed to separate spheres, is evoked and confirmed to account
for the presence of women in public space, according to gender and social class roles, a
presence which is however socially invisibilised.
We conclude that the Room’s space, initially segregated for moral reasons, was later
transformed through an appropriation which went from separatism to integration, as a
response to ethical claims gaining ground in society. This separatism was, therefore, an
intermediate step towards a more equalitarian use of space.",TRUE,FALSE,gendered space|Portugal|public libraries|public space|the New State regime|women,2019-08-09T22:04:26.797393,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T22:03:54.893764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/citation/,ybnvh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4b12900f488d00168eba09/,5d4b12900f488d00168eba09,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ybnvh/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ybnvh

No disruptive Internet ""impact"" was found: Internet use may contribute to reinforce traditional representations of the library, while it may also update and democratise other representations.

Como pano de fundo, um processo de crescente industrialização, de base colonial, a consolidação do aparelho de Estado burguês e, no campo cultural, uma forte atividade da imprensa periódica, a produção do romance, o incremento da literacia e do público leitor. A criação da biblioteca moderna na Europa é histórica e socialmente conformada pela normalização das línguas nacionais e pela introdução de sistemas nacionais de ensino, ligadas à proclamação de identidades nacionais e de fronteiras redesenhadas.
O caso da conflituosa criação da Biblioteca Pública de Braga, incluindo a sócio-biografia e teoria do seu bibliotecário primeiro, encerra interessante capacidade explicativa sobre as relações de poder em torno da propriedade, produção e formação intelectuais que moldaram a instituição. O caso permite ainda compreender visões de grupos sociais diversos quanto à finalidade e utilidade da biblioteca pública, particularmente da pequena burguesia e do intelectual público então em formação.

The precise network, or mode of exchange varies according to context, but these modes of exchange tend to fall into a handful of categories: specifically, giving without expectation of receiving, reciprocal relationships, and pooling. In this manuscript we address whether the stability of populations to small perturbations can play a role in understanding why only a limited number of modes of exchange are typical. We develop a simple model of exchange between populations located in different environments, and show that any mode of exchange in our model will help to buffer the risk associated with local environmental variability. However, we find only a limited set of modes of exchange will guarantee population stability when resources are scarce, and these mirror the empirical classifications of exchange. We don't consider directly the evolution of this cooperative behavior, but our results demonstrate that stability may provide a filter for viable modes of exchange once cooperation has arisen.",TRUE,FALSE,coupled human-natural systems|environmental variability|exchange|trade,2019-08-09T22:08:27.145916,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T22:08:00.238893,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/citation/,73y26,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4b003f0f488d00168eaf94/,5d4b003f0f488d00168eaf94,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73y26/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/73y26/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/73y26

In 2006, just after Brazil introduced policies to reduce deforestation, these differences disappear.

An emerging research field, using the latest global socioeconomic and climate scenarios – namely the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration (RCPs) – is exploring how different socioeconomic pathways will influence future society’s ability to cope with climate change impacts. While the SSPs have been extensively used at the global scale, their use at the local and urban scale has remained rare, as they first need to be contextualized and extended for the particular place of interest. In this study, we present and apply a method to develop multi-scale extended SSPs at the city and neighborhood scale. Using Boston, Massachusetts, as a case study, we combined scenario matching, experts’ elicitation, and participatory processes to contextualize and make the global SSPs relevant at the urban scale. We subsequently employed the extended SSPs to explore future neighborhood-level vulnerability to extreme heat under multiple plausible socioeconomic trajectories, highlighting the usefulness of extended SSPs in informing future vulnerability assessments.
