While previous work has focused on the ethnic composition of student bodies, this study places schools in their institutional and local contexts. The authors argue that the formation of identities and networks varies across local areas depending on the extent of ethnic stratification across schools. Empirically, the authors turn to the case of Germany, where the role of schools as producers of categorical inequalities is particularly obvious. The analysis links large-scale survey data on adolescents’ identification and networks with administrative geocoded information on local stratification across secondary schools. The authors find that minority students in schools with identical ethnic compositions show different inclinations to identify as a majority group member and to form friendships with majority peers, depending on the local extent of ethnic stratification across schools. To place these findings in a cross-national perspective, the authors identify scope conditions of these mechanisms of boundary making and discuss their presence in other countries and school systems. The results support recent theories of immigrant incorporation and offer a more contextualized understanding of ethnic boundary making in schools.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-21T19:25:33.244576,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-21T19:24:54.872764,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/citation/,cnh65,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eefb1dd145b1a0171534ba2/,5eefb1dd145b1a0171534ba2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cnh65/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cnh65/,https://doi.org/10.1086/705561,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cnh65

The author outlines some of the contemporary challenges in the sociology of education, describes the moral and political education outlined by Dewey, Durkheim, and Du Bois, and then stresses how their focus on education allows both scholars and citizens to reconsider the role of internal goods, meritocracy, and a political and economic redistribution no longer rooted in the “merit” of its recipients as determined by school achievement.",TRUE,FALSE,civic education|classical sociological theory|classical theory|Dewey|Du Bois|Durkheim|education|meritocracy|moral education|morality|politics|sociological theory|sociology of education|sociology of morality|theory,2020-06-21T03:31:00.665047,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-21T03:30:43.565379,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/citation/,9x4gm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eeeaec5145b1a0152533c5e/,5eeeaec5145b1a0152533c5e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x4gm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9x4gm/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9x4gm

We pursue this work recognizing that as the scope and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, the implications to workers and labor markets are profound. Our focus on online labor markets and workers reflects our enduring interest in knowledge work, with a particular attention to precarious work. Market data show the dramatic shifts in work availability (supply) and the changes in worker availability (demand) as the United States’ economy struggles with the initial burst of effects of a pandemic. Interview data reveal that freelance workers are aware of these shifts. These changes to already- precarious and market-driven work arrangements are magnified by the realities of balancing family members’ changes in job status, working around children who are home from school, and re-organizing work and lives to account for the rapid onset and confusion of stay-at-home requirements and the uncertainty that is the core of the pandemic. Findings suggest work flexibility, which seems central to freelancer’s motivation to pursue such work, is diminishing and instead freelancers are being driven by desperation rooted in the acknowledged precarity of their situation, magnified by the constellation of events reshaping their working arrangements. We further observe that these effects vary by occupation and are more keenly experienced by women freelancers, both of which warrant additional attention.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Freelance work|Motivation|Occupations|Online labor markets|Online Labour Index,2020-06-23T04:03:54.213366,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23T04:03:20.316423,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/citation/,67ptf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eedf3096598280127cf3d41/,5eedf3096598280127cf3d41,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/67ptf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/67ptf

Debates have been raised about the MSM classification for decades. However, we know little about how people who are classified as MSM perceive and respond to this classification, particularly in the authoritarian context where the biopower interacts with the repressive state power. Drawing upon Ian Hacking's dynamic nominalism theory, this study tries to fill these gaps with interviews of 40 gay men in three Chinese cities about their interactions with public health education materials. I examined their perceptions of MSM knowledge and discourses associated with the classification, as well as their identifications to the MSM subject. I found that, on the one hand, many gay men had internalized the MSM subjectivity and considered themselves essentially at high risk of HIV infection. This compliance was constructed through various biopower techniques with the support of the state's repressive power, as the Chinese state censored almost all public representations of gay men except the HIV/AIDS subject MSM. On the other hand, some of my interviewees were resistant to be part of the MSM classification. I showed how this failure is an unintended consequence of the hegemonic MSM discourse and the authoritarian regime's institutional exclusion of the gay men's community's engagement in the expertise network that develops intervention materials and strategies. At last, I proposed to move beyond the debate around the name and representational character of the MSM by moving toward a more reflexive public health.",TRUE,FALSE,Authoritarianism|Biopolitics|China|Dynamic nominalism|HIV/AIDS|LGTBQ|Men who have sex with men (MSM)|Public health,2020-06-23T03:56:43.808262,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23T03:56:33.270802,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",Chuncheng Liu,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/citation/,jfg24,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v6j2b/,v6j2b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eed5b07145b1a013952e144/,5eed5b07145b1a013952e144,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jfg24/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jfg24/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112947,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jfg24

Between Institutions and the Market,"Since the nineteenth-century romanticism, the “singularity regime” highlights the vocation and achievements of the individual creator. Recently, the artist as an entrepreneur has been defended, including within the artistic sector and art schools, and the model of the artist as a worker put forward. Exactly who are visual artists in Switzerland today? What is or are their self-representation(s)? Do artists manage to live from their artistic production?

We apply this model to analyse 25,632,876 migration instances that take place between Turkey's 81 provinces from 2009 to 2018. We quantify the associations of economic, physical, social, political, and network factors with migration. We find that economic prosperity and population in and the spatial distance between the origin and destination, as well as network characteristics such as reciprocity, province popularity and centrality are important predictors of migration. We also find that electoral distance between provinces and the strength of the AKP (Justice and Development Party) in a province are associated with migration. The proportion of Kurds in a province has no sizeable association with in- and out-migration.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-21T03:24:43.054961,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-21T03:24:29.448421,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/sinanyildirim/Migration_Turkey.git,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/citation/,rf724,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eed0c2e145b1a011f52cf46/,5eed0c2e145b1a011f52cf46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rf724/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rf724/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rf724
