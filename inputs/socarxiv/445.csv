The potential they have for causing serious injury gives them a contradictory power: They can be used to do serious violence or to reduce the likelihood of any violence; they can deescalate an altercation or prime aggressive behavior; and they can be essential mechanisms for self- protection while also being offensive and dangerous. These contradictions make weapon carrying and use fascinating but complicated areas to study, and this complexity can be seen both in public and in academic debate. Throughout this chapter, when considering offender decision making, it is important to recall the many overlapping and often contradictory functions that weapons fulfill for users. Binary interpretations of weapons as having purely offensive or defensive functions will limit our ability to understand offender decision making and should be avoided wherever possible. This chapter is divided into four main sections that relate to the decision to carry and use a weapon: (1) how we define and learn about weapon use in crime, (2) why and how weapons can affect the success of a crime, (3) why offenders choose to carry and use weapons, and (4) a discussion of how weapon use actually affects the success of a crime.",TRUE,FALSE,aggression|firearms|guns|offender decision-making|rational choice theory|violence|weapons,2019-05-14T13:24:22.813772,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T13:23:45.010973,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/citation/,vaxsy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sbzxj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/relationships/node/,sbzxj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd92c45840cae001a7050ff/,5cd92c45840cae001a7050ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vaxsy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vaxsy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vaxsy,NA

These components have direct relevance to quality assurance in engineering education. Literature suggests that better assessment and evaluation practices require certain knowledge and skills about types and methods of assessment and evaluation. It is found that most of the engineering faculty members do not have concrete knowledge about ‘assessment’ and ‘evaluation’ types and methods. Further, it is argued that engineering educators are not well aware of ‘feedback comments’ that are associated with assessment practices. Comments on students’ performances are essential because it helps them to know their strengths and weaknesses of a course. In this background, the paper critically analyses assessment and evaluation practices in engineering education setup across the globe. In particular, it discusses the challenges faced by engineering faculty members while assessing students’ performances. Finally, the paper offers suggestions to improve assessment and evaluation practices so that students doing engineering programs will be largely benefited.",TRUE,FALSE,Assessment and Evaluation|Engineering Education|Feedback Comments|Higher Education|Quality Assurance in Engineering Education,2019-05-17T10:37:42.215631,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-17T10:37:05.421065,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",IEEE,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/citation/,4kybj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd9109ff8214b00178d5aa8/,5cd9109ff8214b00178d5aa8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4kybj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4kybj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4kybj,https://doi.org/10.1109/CISPEE.2018.8593451

This article describes the design and development of identification of students' misconceptions in an individualized learning environment (iSMILE) system that includes accommodations for students’ misconceptions in order to improve student’s conceptual understanding and finally learning outcome. The assessment process is carried out by preparing two-level multiple-choice questions. Misconceptions are identified for each instructional objective to make a root question and linked questions. Depending on the answers provided by the student in first level, the linked questions are given to get more information regarding the misconception. Based on the first and second level answers of students, feedbacks are provided with the misconception identified. One of the most important differences of our iSMILE system, with respect to the other developed systems, is the inclusion of misconception based feedback.

Our quotidian has been transformed over the last fifty years by the adoption of innovative networking and computing technology. The digital world presents opportunities for public archaeology to engage, inform and interact with people globally. Yet, as more personal data are published online, there are growing concerns over privacy, security, and the long-term implications of sharing digital information. These concerns extend beyond the living, to the dead, and are thus important considerations for archaeologists who share the stories of past people online. This analysis argues that the ‘born-digital’ records of humanity may be considered as public digital mortuary landscapes, representing death, memorialization and commemoration. The potential for the analysis of digital data from these spaces could result in a phenomenon approaching immortality, whereby artificial intelligence is applied to the data of the dead. This paper investigates the ethics of a digital public archaeology of the dead while considering the future of our digital lives as mnemonic spaces, and their implications for the living.

Two decades after South Africa launched a world-leading legal framework for LGBTI protections, I argue that these media representations depict the growing inclusion of black LGBTIQ people as a process of bridging the supposed “gap” between homosexuality and African culture. This new “bridging the gap” script seemingly rejects the older, dominant script portraying homosexuality as intrinsically “un-African.” But I argue that it instead reproduces the “un-African” script in a new, liberal guise, offering inclusion to black LGBTIQ South Africans on limited terms that continue to obscure their embeddedness within African histories and communities.",TRUE,FALSE,African culture|African marriage|homosexuality|intersectionality|LGBT identities|media|same-sex marriage|South Africa|tradition,2019-05-12T15:51:46.884196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-12T15:51:31.085017,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/citation/,hcq9y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8duwz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/relationships/node/,8duwz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd799ee840cae001a6f9f5b/,5cd799ee840cae001a6f9f5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hcq9y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hcq9y,https://doi.org/10.2979/africatoday.67.1.04

To study the trade-offs between these two paths to influence, we use a game in which contributions may affect electoral outcomes and signal policy-relevant information to politicians. In the model, a campaign donor and two politicians each possess private information correlated with a policy-relevant state of the world. The donor may allocate his budget to either an ally candidate who has relatively similar preferences or a moderate candidate whose preferences are relatively divergent from the donor's preferred policy. Contributions that increase the likelihood of the moderate being elected can signal good news about the donor's preferred policy and influence the moderate's policy choice.

Using a mixed, US-Italian sample of college students living in cities on similar latitudes, we found that there is a bias in placing U.S. cities further north and European cities further south than where they should be. Such biases reflect a process of ‘plausible reasoning,’ which assumes that places are located cartographically in a biased way due to cultural-cognitive processes facilitated by media. The specific media found to be related with such biases in this study and directions for future research are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,geography|media effects|perception|place|social media|space|traditional media,2019-05-11T20:29:49.658404,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-11T20:29:28.748842,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/citation/,rde9a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd70542840cae00197023c8/,5cd70542840cae00197023c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rde9a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rde9a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rde9a,NA

This is particularly true in science museums, and researchers have pointed to awe as an epistemic emotion that can promote science learning. We present two studies of awe in a science museum. The first study (n = 293) examined how awe—conceptualized as a multifaceted construct associated with positive feelings of liberation/connection, negative feelings of oppression/isolation, chills, and diminished-self perceptions—differed across museum locations and in relation to prior knowledge. The second study (n = 708) expanded the investigation to also examine the relationship between awe and critical thinking. Across both studies, we found that, relative to baseline spaces, vast, beautiful spaces elicited positive awe-related emotions (amazement, curiosity) and stronger awe correlates (chills, diminished-self perceptions); vast, threatening spaces also elicited stronger amazement, chills, and diminished-self perceptions—but also stronger oppression/isolation. In both studies, pre-visit knowledge was associated with awe experiences during the visit. In Study 2, we also found evidence for relationships between awe and skepticism and aesthetic thought, two aspects of critical thinking: Positive aspects of awe (liberation/connection, curiosity) were associated with more skepticism, and negative aspects of awe (oppression/isolation, disorientation) with less skepticism. In terms of aesthetic thinking, diminished-self perceptions were associated being able describe observed roles and actions, and chills were associated with being able to describe personal opinions. These results support the assertion that awe can be used to encourage engagement and learning in informal science settings.",TRUE,FALSE,awe|critical thinking|informal learning|museums|science education,2019-05-10T18:16:22.059778,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-10T18:15:59.553942,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/citation/,t5fj6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd5badc840cae001a6f090c/,5cd5badc840cae001a6f090c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5fj6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t5fj6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t5fj6,NA

However, parental wealth is often ignored in research on social inequality in education, or its influence is only considered at later stages of children’s educational careers. Our paper contributes to this research by examining the relationship between parental wealth and (1) children’s math competences at the beginning of primary school; (2) the development of children’s competences throughout primary school; and (3) children’s transition from primary to secondary school. We are looking at Germany, where the early ability tracking may make an early investment in education particularly important. Analyzing data from the German National Educational Panel Study, we find that parental wealth has a distinct association with children’s educational outcomes that adds to social disparities by other measures of parents’ socioeconomic status (SES). Our results indicate that children in wealthy households have higher competences already in the first grade. This advantage remains stable throughout primary school and translates into a higher probability to attend the highest secondary school track. Moreover, children in these wealthy households are more likely to attend the highest secondary school track, net of differences in competences and performance. Our results imply that ignoring wealth as a component of parental SES leads to an underestimation of the level of social inequality in education in Germany.",TRUE,FALSE,Educational Decisions|Mathematical Competence|NEPS|Stratification|Wealth,2019-05-10T17:27:51.397762,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-10T17:27:29.205398,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/citation/,jbyhz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3ys6z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/relationships/node/,3ys6z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd54d04f244ec0021e3c050/,5cd54d04f244ec0021e3c050,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jbyhz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jbyhz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jbyhz,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2020.100483
