a broad environmental agenda. Eventually the union went as far as
incorporating environmental concerns in collective bargaining and calling
for an end to the internal combustion engine. These actions are
particularly noteworthy because they challenged the union’s economic
foundation: the automobile industry. However, as a closer examination of
the record shows, there was a significant disjuncture between the union’s
international leadership, which pushed a broad vision of labor
environmentalism, and its rank-and-file membership, which proved resistant
to the issue. By the close of the 1970s, the conjunction of economic

This prominent failure of China’s “Going Out” investment strategy reverberated globally. Both Western and Chinese accounts frame the event as a pivotal moment in Myanmar’s celebrated reform process, the cooling of China–Myanmar relations, and US–China geopolitical rivalry in the Asia-Pacific. However, my ethnographic field and media research from 2010 to 2015 reveals that the mega-project’s failure does not originally stem from inter-state geopolitics or contested economics and ecology. Through chronological narration, I show how the Myitsone Dam is primarily the casualty of a distinctly ethno-political causality, whereby three nationalisms clashed and the replication of China’s “anti-ethno-political” model of development failed. Though no monolithic Chinese state directs “Chinese Development” overseas, individual Chinese entrepreneurs nonetheless draw from the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC’s) anti-political and state-centric paradigm when facing foreign social worlds. In the particular case of Myitsone, Chinese proponents drew from PRC’s state-nationalist heuristics of “national minorities and state-led development” and “Western anti-China conspiracy,” when facing Myanmar’s ethnic Kachin and Burman nationalisms. State ideological subjectivities of these developers seemed to blind them to the weakness in their own anti-ethno-political strategies, even when those collapsed publicly. I conclude that the Myitsone Dam’s construction will likely not be restarted, despite the hydropower company’s efforts.

Evangelical gender attitudes regarding work and family issues are more conservative than those of all other groups, but are adaptive to broad trends, changing at a rate similar to those of other groups. Evangelical attitudes toward the morality of homosexuality and same-sex marriage are more conservative than those of all other religious groups, and their rate of change is slower over time. Separate trends on the two issues suggest that gender and sexuality attitude change is decoupled, especially among evangelicals who are adapting more on gender while increasingly distinguishing themselves on same-sex relationships.

Extending previous research, I focus on high earners with other groups included for comparison. Predicted probabilities based upon fully-interacted models provide four key findings: (1) There are no significant gender differences among high earners; (2) high-earning women are less religious than low-earning women; (3) high-earning men are more religious than low-earning men; and (4) differences among women and among men at different earnings levels are just as large as average differences between women and men. Further analyses demonstrate that the relationship between gender, earnings, and religiosity varies by race.

analysing the major stakeholders in the UK. The conceptualization is based
on a review of popular Open Data definitions and business ecosystem
theories, which are applied to qualitative empirical data. The work is
informed by a combination of discourse analysis and a content analysis of
in-depth interviews, undertaken during the summer of 2013. Drawing on the
UK as a best practice example, the authors examine a set of structural
business ecosystem properties: circular flow of resources, sustainability,
demand that encourages supply, and dependence developing between suppliers,
intermediaries, and users. The authors identify that gaps and shortcomings
remain. Most prominently, demand is not yet fully encouraging supply and
actors have yet to experience fully mutual interdependence.
