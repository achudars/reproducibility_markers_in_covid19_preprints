However, no comprehensive mechanistic model based on their insights has emerged, leaving it difficult to evaluate empirically or quantitatively the different explanations offered. Here I present a spatially- and temporally-resolved agent-based model of large-scale (&gt;200 thousand km2) agrarian states and steppe nomadic confederations in Afro-Eurasia between the middle Bronze and the end of the Medieval era (1500 BCE - 1500 CE).  The model tracks the spread of agrarian states as they expand, conquer the territory of other states or are themselves conquered, depending on their relative modeled population size and military efficiency.  To accurately retrodict the historical record, several key regional technological advances in state military and agricultural efficiencies are identified. Modifying the location, scale, and timing of these innovations allows quantitative investigation of historically-plausible alternative trajectories of state growth, spread, and fragmentation, while demonstrating the operation and limits of the model.  In particular, under nominal assumptions, the historically rapid increase of agrarian state sizes, first in southwest Asia after 600 CE and then in east Asia after 200 BCE, is accounted for by modeling increasing military efficiency improvements  in response to intense extortion pressure from nomadic tribes and subsequent ‘mirror’ confederations following the invention and slow diffusion of horse cavalry tactics across the steppe after 1000 BCE. However, in spite of various technological advances, throughout the period the modeled creation and spread of new agrarian states is a fundamental consequence of state collapse and internal civil wars triggered by rising 'demographic-structural' pressures that occur when territorial growth is checked yet (elite) population growth continues.  Together the model's underlying mechanisms substantially account for the number of states, their duration, location, spread rate, overall occupied area, and population size for three millennia.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|history|state collapse|state formation|steppe nomads,2020-08-24T11:46:15.310338,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-24T11:45:37.881343,FALSE,NA,no,Historical population data (KK10) available via Jed Kaplan.

There is as yet no standard method for the ‘unsupervised’ inductive identification of frames based upon the content of articles. Three groups of core approaches underlie a wide range of work in this area, and we compare three techniques based on these approaches against each other and against manual human analysts.  The three techniques are a k-means clustering algorithm together with a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)-based feature selection process; evolutionary factor analysis (EFA), a factor analysis approach; and the structural topic model (STM). We use two datasets – one very focused and one extremely broad – as examples of the kind of frame analysis problems readers may wish to attempt. Even in a highly targeted dataset, we find some distance between the frames generated by computational analysis and those manually produced by our human analysts. The details of each method have a substantial impact on frame quality and interpretation. We find that the STM approach is the most effective for our narrow-scope dataset, but that it returns definite topics, and not frames, when working on our very broad dataset. We also show that we can get results emphasizing different parts of the framing problem by combining parts of different methods as a multi-stage process, rather than viewing available methods as simple plug-and-play models.",TRUE,FALSE,computational communication science|framing|methods|political communication,2020-08-21T21:18:21.786232,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-21T21:18:06.631935,FALSE,NA,no,The underlying news article data are non-redistributable.

But is science up to the task? This is far from self‐evident. The demands on science in times of crisis run counter to the values of good, normal science. Crisis science needs to be fast, univocal, personalized, and direct, while normal science is slow, contentious, collective, and sensitive to complexity. Science can only play its atypical role if it is staged in the public arena. Some patterns of staging stand out: personalization, visualization, and connection to lived experiences. So far, the staging of science has been successful, but it is fragile. The COVID‐19 crisis shows the potential of well‐staged forms of alliance between science and policy, but when the general assumption is that scientists will “solve” societal “problems,” the staging of science has gone too far.",TRUE,FALSE,Corona|COVID 19|policy science interface,2020-08-21T21:17:43.024775,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-21T21:17:19.767644,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/citation/,nfm5j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3fd0c8746a8100e81a2354/,5f3fd0c8746a8100e81a2354,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfm5j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nfm5j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nfm5j,https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.13219

extend this literature by assessing how parental divorce on both sides of a (potential) couple
affects their partnering dynamics. Specifically, we explore 1) whether there is parental divorce
homogamy and whether the parental divorce of both partners adds to the dissolution of both 2)
cohabiting and 3) married unions. Our analyses use event history models on high-quality
Finnish Census Panel data covering 28,021 cohabiting and marital partnerships between ages
18 and 45. We found substantial parental divorce homogamy in that children who experienced
parental divorce are 13% more likely to cohabit with and 17% more likely to marry a fellow
child of divorce. Moreover, contrary to evidence from the United States and Norway, our
findings for Finland support an additive, not a multiplicative, effect. Here, both partners’
parental divorce increases their offspring’s dissolution risk by 20% for cohabitation and 70%
for marriage compared to couples where neither of their parents are divorced. We conclude that
parental divorce on both sides of a couple affects family formation processes at multiple stages.
In Finland, these effects are notably less than previously found in the United States. This is
likely because cohabitation and separation are wide-spread and socially accepted in Finland
and an expansive welfare state buffers the socio-economic consequences of divorce.",TRUE,FALSE,cohabitation|divorce|intergenerational relations|union dissolution,2020-08-21T13:03:49.429955,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-21T13:03:23.540794,FALSE,NA,no,Licenses to use data are granted by Stastistics Finland (www.stat.fi/index_en).,,no,No public preregistration.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Sanna Kailaheimo-Lönnqvist|Anette Fasang|Marika Jalovaara|Emanuela Struffolino,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/citation/,p6rea,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3f457abacde800c133c192/,5f3f457abacde800c133c192,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6rea/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p6rea/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p6rea,NA

Amongst contemporary couples in the UK, women spent more time than men doing housework, childcare and caring for adults prior to the crisis; thus, lockdown draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. This study aims to answer how couples in the UK divided childcare and housework during lockdown and whether this is associated with changes in levels of psychological distress. Data for this study come from the April and May waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the GHQ score (ranges from 0 to 36). Unpaid care work included men and women’s hours spent on childcare and housework and the impact of increased unpaid care work on employment schedules. We found that every week, women spent 5 more hours on housework and 10 more hours on childcare than men during lockdown, and this increased housework and childcare was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for women. One-third of parents adapted their work patterns because of childcare/ homeschooling. Men and women who adapted their work patterns had on average 1.16 and 1.39 higher GHQ scores than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother.

Fathers had more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours.

In this paper, I argue that while foreign disinformation campaigns are generally part of a states' broader foreign policy, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in foreign disinformation campaigns evolve out of a state's domestic disinformation apparatus. I use the history and evolution of the Chinese Communist Party's domestic and foreign disinformation efforts to make this argument. The Chinese case presents a unique opportunity for analysis because of the clear demarcation between domestic and foreign social media: Chinese citizens are blocked from using popular social media platforms used in much of the rest of the world so the CCP must use different platforms and techniques to spread disinformation domestically and abroad. Comparing both sides of this divide since 2012 illuminates that early foreign campaigns mirrored domestic efforts while later campaigns developed distinct characteristics. This finding could allow researchers to use previously identified domestic propaganda and disinformation campaigns to anticipate and mitigate the impact of foreign disinformation campaigns.",TRUE,FALSE,Beijing|CCP|Cheerleading|China|Chinese Communist Party|Communication|Disinformation|Fake News|Flooding|Geopolitics|GRU|Hong Kong|Information Operation|IO|IRA|Misinformation|Propaganda|Russia|Social Media|Social Sciences|Taiwan|Tibet|Xi Jinping|Xinjiang,2020-08-21T12:58:51.496875,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-21T12:58:20.571311,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/citation/,6qrn5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3e79ad746a8100451a8c15/,5f3e79ad746a8100451a8c15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qrn5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qrn5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qrn5,NA

For Clausewitz, violence is a means used in war to achieve political ends. Since the end of the East-West conflict, however, it is widely thought that Clausewitz's ideas are no longer applicable. Current forms of war may be violent, it is said, but they are no longer political because they are not waged by states alone, for the raison d'état narrowly conceived. This objection, however, rests on a misunderstanding of Clausewitz's concept of politics. This article seeks to reconstruct this concept systematically. It offers an interpretation whereby ""politics"" in Clausewitz's theoretical system denotes an interaction of two or more actors, each of whom wants to realize their respective will but whose wills cannot be fully reconciled. For Clausewitz, war is such politics that is conducted by violent means. Against this background, it is argued that Clausewitz's theory of war provides a fruitful analytical framework to understand the transformations of political violence from the cabinet wars of the 18th century to the ""new wars"" of our time.",TRUE,FALSE,Carl von Clausewitz|Conflict|International relations|New wars|Political violence,2020-08-20T10:39:21.653138,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T10:31:53.197766,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/citation/,4jafx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3e31a5746a81003b1a74f1/,5f3e31a5746a81003b1a74f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jafx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4jafx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4jafx,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11615-020-00269-9
