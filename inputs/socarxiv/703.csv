debate over property rules in the technology law context. In particular, it
argues that the classic justification for legal entitlements protected by a
property rule - i.e., a right to injunctive relief - depends on the ability
to define and enforce property rights effectively. In the case of many
technology markets, the inability to tailor injunctive relief so that it
protects only the underlying right rather than also enjoining noninfringing
conduct provides a powerful basis for using a liability rule (i.e.,
awarding the relevant damages to the plaintiff) instead of a property rule.
Notably, where injunctive relief cannot be confined to protecting the
underlying right, the availability of such relief can give rise to a
""holdup strategy,"" whereby a firm threatens or uses litigation to obtain a
settlement significantly in excess of any harm it suffers. Such strategies,
as the Article explains, arise in a variety of technology law contexts,
including patent law, digital copyright cases, and spectrum regulation.
Depending on the particulars of the context, either courts or agencies
should superintend the relevant liability regime and, in some cases, the
administrative challenges may undermine the case for a liability rule at
all. Unfortunately, legal scholars have generally focused on the
substantive debate as to the proper scope of property rights - often
arguing for an all or nothing solution - at the expense of evaluating the
institutional considerations as to whether and when courts or agencies can
superintend a liability regime in lieu of a property right.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:45.076513,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:57:41.309000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/citation/,vgf7p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ghna7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/relationships/node/,ghna7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde0169ad5a1020668d76e/,57bde0169ad5a1020668d76e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf7p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vgf7p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vgf7p

internalize the external costs and benefits one party's action confers on
another. They have thought this internalization desirable, reasoning that
if a party didn't capture the full social value of her actions she wouldn't
have optimal incentives to engage in those actions. Measured by this
standard, IP rights are inefficiently weak. There is abundant evidence that
the social value of innovations far exceeds the private value. But there is
also good evidence that, contrary to what economists might assume, these
spillovers actually encourage greater innovation. The result is a puzzle
for Demsetzians.

In this article, we offer three insights that help to explain the positive
role of innovation spillovers. First, we note that in IP, unlike real
property, a wide range of externalities matter, because IP rights are much
less certain than property rights, and because the decision to create a
legal entitlement will determine whether or not a transaction must occur.
Second, we make the point that while society needs some ex ante incentive
to innovate, it doesn't need (and doesn't particularly want) full
internalization of the benefits of an invention. Third, we observe that
even where internalizing externalities is desirable, property rights do not
in fact do so perfectly, and they create problematic distortions in
circumstances in which the buyer in a transaction makes productive reuse of
the work. The result of combining these insights is that at least where
innovation is concerned, we cannot rely on the easy equation of property
rights with efficient internalization of externalities.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:04.452008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:52:12.439000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/citation/,ytzev,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m5erb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/relationships/node/,m5erb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bddecdb83f6901f7656547/,57bddecdb83f6901f7656547,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytzev/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytzev/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ytzev

equities before permanently enjoining a defendant. This is a good thing.
Since eBay, the tactic of threatening injunctions to, in the Court’s words,
“extract exorbitant fees” has declined. It's now harder for a patent
assertion entity (PAE), or patent “troll,"" and in certain cases, operating
companies, to win an injunction. But eBay’s discretionary test doesn’t
apply at the ITC. This has had the unintended consequence of driving those
who seek to circumvent eBay's ruling to the ITC, where the odds of getting
an injunctions are better. In this paper, we document that trend, which is
dramatic. Increasingly, cases filed at the ITC are filed by PAEs against an
entire industry, often information technology. Practicing entities too have
turned to the ITC to seek injunctions district courts won't give them, for
example on patents covering industry standards.

Because the ITC can’t award damages, it has granted injunctions as a matter
of course. But as we suggest in this paper, the Commission has more power
to adjust the remedy it grants than previously recognized. We think it
should use that flexibility to limit exclusion orders when competitive
conditions demand it. A PAE may not be any more justified to receive an
exclusion order from the ITC under its public interest analysis than to
receive an injunction from a district court applying eBay. Even practicing
entities should be denied the power to exclude in some circumstances, for
example when the patents are standards-essential and/or encumbered by a
RAND license, there is no evidence of bad faith, and the patentee can seek
damages in the district court. When exclusion orders are issued, delays in
their implementation and grandfathering in existing products can reduce
holdup. Bond and penalty provisions could be used to ensure that patentees
are compensated for ongoing infringement during these transition periods.
Using its discretion wisely, the ITC can administer the statute to fairly

numbers to patent nanotechnology inventions. This rush to the patent office
is so significant that many law firms have established nanotechnology
practice groups, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has now created a
new technology class designed to track nanotechnology products. Three big
differences between the emerging science of nanotechnology and other
inventions make the role of patents more significant here than elsewhere.
First, this is the first new field in a century in which people started
patenting the basic ideas at the outset. In most other fields of invention
over the past century - computer hardware, software, biotechnology, the
Internet - the basic building blocks of the field were unpatented. In
nanotech, by contrast, companies and universities alike are patenting early
and often. A second factor driving the importance of patents in
nanotechnology is its unique cross-industry structure. Unlike other new
industries, in which the patentees are largely actual or at least potential
participants in the market, a significant number of nanotechnology
patentees will own rights not just in the industry in which they
participate, but in other industries as well. This may significantly affect
their incentives to license the patents. Finally, a large number of the
basic patents have issued to universities, who have become far more active
in patenting in the last 25 years. While universities have no direct
incentive to restrict competition, their interests may or may not align
with the optimal implementation of building-block nanotechnology inventions.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:08.844128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:49:10.963000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/citation/,2q9n4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bsg3r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/relationships/node/,bsg3r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bdde18b83f6901f8656276/,57bdde18b83f6901f8656276,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9n4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2q9n4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2q9n4

century to figure out why we protect trade secrets. The puzzle is not in
understanding what trade secret law covers; there seems to be widespread
agreement on the basic contours of the law. Nor is the problem that people
object to the effects of the law. Rather, the puzzle is a theoretical one:
no one can seem to agree where trade secret law comes from or how to fit it
into the broader framework of legal doctrine. Courts, lawyers, scholars,
and treatise writers argue over whether trade secrets are a creature of
contract, of tort, of property, or even of criminal law. None of these
different justifications have proven entirely persuasive. Worse, they have
contributed to inconsistent treatment of the basic elements of a trade
secret cause of action, and uncertainty as to the relationship between
trade secret laws and other causes of action. Robert Bone has gone so far
as to suggest that this theoretical incoherence suggests that there is no
need for trade secret law as a separate doctrine at all.

In this article, I suggest that trade secrets can be justified as a form,
not of traditional property, but of intellectual property (IP). The
incentive justification for encouraging new inventions is straightforward.
Granting legal protection for those new inventions not only encourages
their creation, but enables an inventor to sell her idea. And while we have
other laws that encourage inventions, notably patent law, trade secrecy
offers some significant advantages for inventors over patent protection.

It seems odd, though, for the law to encourage secrets, or to encourage
only those inventions that are kept secret. I argue that, paradoxically,
trade secret law is actually designed to encourage disclosure, not secrecy.
Without legal protection, companies in certain industries would invest too
much in keeping secrets. Trade secret law develops as a substitute for the
physical and contractual restrictions those companies would otherwise
impose in an effort to prevent a competitor from acquiring their
information.

The puzzle then becomes why the law would require secrecy as an element of
the cause of action if its goal is to reduce secrecy. I argue that the
secrecy requirement serves a channeling function. Only the developers of
some kinds of inventions have the option to over-invest in physical secrecy
in the absence of legal protection. For products that are inherently
self-disclosing (the wheel, say, or the paper clip), trying to keep the
idea secret is a lost cause. We don't need trade secret law to encourage
disclosure of inherently self-disclosing products - inventors of such
products will get patent protection or nothing. But if trade secret law
prevented the use of ideas whether or not they were secret, the result
would be less, not more, diffusion of valuable information. The secrecy
requirement therefore serves a gatekeeper function, ensuring that the law
encourages disclosure of information that would otherwise be kept secret,
while channeling inventors of self-disclosing products to the patent
system.

My argument has a number of implications for trade secret policy. First,
the theory works only if we treat trade secrets as an IP right, requiring
proof of secrecy as an element of protection. If we give the protection to
things that are public, we defeat the purpose and give windfalls to people
who may not be inventors (what we might call ""trade secret trolls""). Courts
that think of trade secret law as a common law tort rather than an IP right
are apt to overlook the secrecy requirement in their zeal to reach ""bad
actors."" Second, an IP theory of trade secrets also encourages preemption
of ""unjust enrichment"" theories and other common-law ways courts are
tempted to give private parties legal control over information in the
public domain. Thus, an IP theory of trade secrets is in part a ""negative""
one: the value of trade secret law lies in part in defining the boundaries
of the cause of action and preempting others that might reach too far.
Finally, treating trade secrets as IP rights helps secure their place in
the pantheon of legal protection for inventions. The traditional conception
of the tradeoff between patents and trade secrets views the disclosure
function of the patent system as one of its great advantages over trade
secret law. And indeed the law operates in various ways to encourage

are facilitated because the Hatch-Waxman Act has been interpreted to give
180 days of generic exclusivity to the first generic company to file for
FDA approval, whether or not that company succeeds in invalidating the
patent or finding a way to avoid infringement. As a result, the patentee
can “buy off” the first generic entrant, paying them to delay their entry
into the market while still offering them the valuable period of generic
exclusivity. And if that first generic is entitled to its 180 days, no one
else can enter until after the exclusivity period has expired or been
forfeited. The result is that the 180-day exclusivity period is not serving
its purpose of eliminating weak patents. True, it is encouraging lots of
challenges to those patents. But it is encouraging the challengers to
accept compensation to drop those challenges, rather than taking them to
judgment and benefiting the rest of the world.

We propose a change to the Hatch-Waxman statutory scheme. Our alternative
is straightforward: first-filing generic drug companies should be entitled
to 180 days of exclusivity only if they successfully defeat the patent
owner, for example, by invalidating the patent or by proving that they did
not infringe that patent. The point of 180-day exclusivity was to encourage
challenges to patents because the invalidation of bad patents benefits
society as a whole. Society doesn’t benefit from a private deal to drop a
challenge. That doesn’t mean settlement is never a good idea; it is a
commonplace in our legal system. But it seems bizarre to insulate a company
from competition just because it settles the case. Indeed, we expect that
our proposal, if implemented, would facilitate more rational settlements,
in which the settlements that result accurately reflect the likelihood of
success in litigation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:43.722700,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:45:43.356000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/citation/,n32y8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wfz9z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/relationships/node/,wfz9z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bddd48594d9001fad0defc/,57bddd48594d9001fad0defc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n32y8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n32y8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n32y8

protection to all kinds of technologies. However, we have recently noticed
an increasing divergence between the rules actually applied to different
industries. Biotechnology provides one of the best examples. In
biotechnology cases, the Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that
uncertainty in predicting the structural features of biotechnological
inventions renders them nonobvious, even if the prior art demonstrates a
clear plan for producing the invention. At the same time, the court claims
that the uncertain nature of the technology requires imposition of
stringent patent enablement and written description requirements that are
not applied to patents in other disciplines. Thus, as a practical matter it
appears that although patent law is technology-neutral in theory, it is
technology-specific in application. Much of the variance in patent
standards is attributable to the use of a legal construct, the ""person
having ordinary skill in the art"" (PHOSITA), to determine obviousness and
enablement. We do not challenge the idea that the standards in each
industry should vary with the level of skill in that industry. We think the
use of the PHOSITA provides needed flexibility for patent law, permitting
it to adapt to new technologies without losing its essential character. We
fear, however, that the Federal Circuit has not applied that standard
properly in biotechnology. The court has a static perception of the field
that was set in its initial analyses of biotechnology inventions, but which
does not reflect the realities of the industry. In the final part of the
paper, we offer a very preliminary policy assessment of these
industry-specific patent cases. We suggest that the special rules the
Federal Circuit has constructed for biotech cases are rather poorly matched
to the specific needs of the industry. Indeed, in some ways the Federal
Circuit cases have it exactly backwards. We offer a few suggestions as to
what a consciously designed biotechnology patent policy may look like.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:48.392579,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:43:17.427000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/citation/,pr7ka,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f4fjd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/relationships/node/,f4fjd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bddcb7b83f6901f3656244/,57bddcb7b83f6901f3656244,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pr7ka/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pr7ka/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pr7ka
