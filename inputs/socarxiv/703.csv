This selfhood is revealed to be essentially fragmented. The complexities of actual self-experience in the modernist period have fragmented and fractured Man, who is overwhelmed with a sense of nothingness, non-connectiveness, and disengagement. This condition is what Samuel Becket tries to convey in Murphy (2000). The aim of this paper is to study the layers of self that are operating in the novel through Murphy’s fragmented social and inner selves. Beckett parodies the traditional artistic and novelistic interest in human action. His novel, Murphy, undermines the characters’ actions, and its language exposes the essential absurdity of its social subject.

Her African American male contemporaries saw her novel as an oversimplification of racial issues. Nevertheless, a closer reading of her book proves otherwise. This paper explores her powerful, albeit subtle, portrayal of the desperation imposed not only on her race, but on her gender as well. Hurston masterfully represents racial and gender issues without resorting to the anger and hostility that appear in the works of most of her contemporary African American male writers such as Richard Wright. Hurston’s characterization of the female protagonist, her skin-color, and even the language she uses, allows her to draw an accurate image of the African American woman in the early 1900s.  Her choice of the African American dialect grants Janie Crawford a voice of her own despite society’s constant attempts to silence her.

Coetzee’s Fiction","This paper addresses corporeality as a space of subversion to hegemonic discourses in J. M. Coetzee’s fiction. The body is not only elusive to representation but it is also entrusted with a certain degree of authority that allows it to contravene the systems of normalization imposed by dominant discourse. The paper tends to appropriate poststructuralism and postcolonialism as its main theoretical grid to argue that corporeality in Coetzee’s novels is deployed as a fluid construct that offers a space of interaction between subjectivities beyond the rigid contours of discursive representation. In Dusklands, the clear-cut demarcations erect between the Self and the Other often blur and disintegrate while facing the permeability and extensiveness of the body. In Waiting for the Barbarians and Foe, however, the mutilated and silenced body of the Other is presented as a space of resistance to the Empire’s attempts to inscribe its statement of powerviolently. It is only the diseased body of Mrs. Curren, in Age of Iron, which transforms into an intersubjective space of reciprocity between Self and Other that is capable of overcoming the fixed barriers between subjects. Being an active site of contestation between subjectivities, the textual construction of corporeality in Coetzee's aforementioned novels offers creative opportunities of becoming and grants an imaginative understanding of otherness outside the limits of the logic of binarism encapsulated in colonial and imperialist discourses.",TRUE,FALSE,colonialrepresentation|corporeality|identity|resistance|subversion,2018-07-02T10:59:29.116766,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T19:49:12.810791,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/citation/,tpdxc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gqw9a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/relationships/node/,gqw9a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/593463186c613b024fed3ca5/,593463186c613b024fed3ca5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpdxc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tpdxc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tpdxc,NA

Drawing on 123 interviews with men and women engaged in different post-secondary education pathways in Australia, the study draws attention to the role of gender and to some extent class in shaping careers in a network of social relations. Three dimensions of flexible careers are examined: temporal, that is, through imagined possibilities in various stages of early adulthood; structural, including opportunities and constraints afforded by different industry sectors and workplaces; and relational, in terms of household-level role negotiations. The findings revealed that women continue to adapt their career goals to accommodate care, but that both men’s and women’s careers are shaped by contingencies including household income, home ownership, access to flexible work and ideological expectations of market/family work roles. These contextual dynamics directly impact on decisions in the present. The study underscores the need for an expanded research focus on work and care from a life course perspective in order to promote career flexibility in ways that align with young people’s broader aspirations for gender equality.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:59:29.086479,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T06:52:47.640908,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/citation/,9c5sw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/47cuz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/relationships/node/,47cuz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5933adb7b83f69024e6a798d/,5933adb7b83f69024e6a798d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c5sw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9c5sw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9c5sw,NA

Set in a fictitious Syrian neighbourhood, the stories of the collection Sour Grapes identify the bans and boundaries burdening contemporary Arab life. By presenting the unusual and the nonsensical, Tamer highlights not only the socio-political and economic problems but the impact of the various social customs and inaccurate interpretations of religious teachings on gender roles and on all that burdens the sheer existence of the Arab individual. The novelist does not name a figure or a regime but compels his reader to question the quality of existence in a working class Arab neighbourhood. Written in (2000), the collection foresees the inevitability of an Arab uprising, which was to take place ten years later. Unlike the stereotypical observations of many orientalists, Tamer’s Sour Grapes takes his readers through the narrow alleys of Queiq, introducing them to the Arab layman. Through the characters’ defiance or their commitment to the social bans and religious prohibitions, Tamer discloses the deep crisis in the Arab social fabric. Through textual analysis and the explanation of inherited bans and boundaries, this paper highlights Tamer’s clever use of the ridiculous to demonstrate how dictators are instated in most aspects of Arab life.

Abstract: It is possible that war in modern societies is largely driven by emotions, but in a way that is almost completely hidden. Modernity individualizes the self and tends to ignore emotions. As a result, conflict can be caused by sequences in which the total hiding of humiliation leads to vengeance. This essay outlines a theory of the social-emotional world implied in the work of C. H. Cooley and others. Cooley’s concept of the “looking-glass self” can be used as antidote to the assumptions of modernity: the basic self is social and emotional: selves are based on “living in the mind” of others, with a result of feeling either pride of shame. Cooley discusses shame at some length, unlike most approaches, which tend to hide it. This essay proposes that the complete hiding of shame can lead to feedback loops (spirals) with no natural limit: shame about shame and anger is only the first step. Emotion backlogs can feed back when emotional experiences are completely hidden: avoiding all pain can lead to limitless spirals. These ideas may help explain the role of France in causing WWI, and Hitler’s rise to power in Germany. To the extent that these propositions are true, the part played by emotions and especially shame in causing wars need to  be further studied.

To illustrate the purchase of this approach, this paper presents an analysis of Chicago’s most recent bout of aldermanic redistricting. In this case, racial arithmetic rested on the ubiquitous juxtaposition of “Latino” and “Black” demographics, as captured in the 2010 census.

Sensory entanglement and wonder are requisite because they bring valuable shifts supporting a more critical and transformative kind of sustainability education by (1) awakening a compassionate connection with the living world, (2) nurturing alternative epistemologies, (3) providing a strengthening function for sustainability educators and their co-learners, for stamina and ongoing engagement, and (4) generating sustainability agency and an active and authentic hope to sustain a sense of the possible in the midst of the dire. This article focuses on how awakening the senses to foster a sense of wonder can nurture grounded, authentic, active hope and agency in sustainability education. It is authored collaboratively by sixteen graduate course participants and faculty co-researchers who discuss interrelated theories pointing to a need to foster senses of wonder in sustainability education. The researchers work in research teams to explore experiential and sense-based hope- and agency-building curricula. Findings include activities and reflections across the five senses as well as with the sixth sense, intuition. Sensing, listening, intimate observing, imagining, feeling, entangling, and wondering can shift unsustainability epistemologies and transform human and cultural engagement. The sense of sound can be immersive and resonant, lending learners to relational and multispecies sensing. Scent can catalyze wonder and inspire experiential, holistic growth and integration of time. Savoring in the sense of taste can extend learners from survival to joy, offering opportunities for mindfulness that can connect cultural and biocultural mutualisms and collaborative sustainability agencies. Pattern sensing for similarity using the visual sense of wonder can support connected knowing and ecological vision. The sense of touch can offer a continuous and mutual comfort and belonging. Visual pattern and texture scavenger hunts can cultivate these sustainability sense capacities. The sixth sense, intuition, opens learners to imaginative, transformative, and connective ways of knowing as place and planet, stimulating hope-giving, integrative sustainability agencies.",TRUE,FALSE,alternative education|ecology|education|educators|#O3S17|outdoor|primary|sensory|sustainability|sustainability education|wonder,2018-07-02T10:59:28.477457,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-02T00:32:14.281935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/citation/,2tjc4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zv68b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/relationships/node/,zv68b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5930afdf594d9002d8bf2ece/,5930afdf594d9002d8bf2ece,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2tjc4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2tjc4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2tjc4,NA

Immigrant Occupational Mobility in First Half of the Twentieth Century,"Assimilation research largely assumes that Southern and Eastern European immigrants achieved assimilation due to job ladders within manufacturing firms in the first half of the twentieth century. But this literature has never tested these claims and often acknowledges that little is known about whether Italians and Slavs experienced upward mobility. Did manufacturing allow for the upward advancement among European-origin groups? Using unique datasets containing employment histories in three manufacturing companies – A.M. Byers Company, Pullman-Standard Manufacturing, and Ford Motor Company - between 1900 and 1950, this article is the first to analyze occupational mobility within factories among European-origin groups. Results suggest that organizational structures within firms through the formation of internal labor markets did little to counter or prevent other forces that kept migrants from achieving upward mobility.  Migrants ended their careers within firms where they began – positions at the bottom of the occupational hierarchy – which runs contrary to assimilation research.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:59:28.382834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-01T18:33:32.910906,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/citation/,typhg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h7ure/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/relationships/node/,h7ure,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59305a67594d9002dbbf13f6/,59305a67594d9002dbbf13f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/typhg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/typhg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/typhg,NA
