The process of managing failure in the transition to adulthood requires narrative work. Normative expectations for ambition make failure a cultural problem for emerging adults to solve. For poor and working-class emerging adults, popular narratives of failure often pathologize them as youth-gone-bad or youth-gone-sad and undermine their ability to produce narratives of ambition. Nevertheless, they will respond to the pressure to tell an ambitious story. Drawing on four waves of life history interviews over a three-and-a-half year period with 23 poor and working-class emerging adult women, I show how they tell life stories using available institutional resources to narratively manage failure by responding to popular explanations for their failure and attempting to maintain claims to ambition. I distinguish between career, practice, and care institutions, which shape the possibilities for overcoming failure through narrative agency.

Responses to Easterbrook, most notably that of Lawrence Lessig in his 1999 article The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach, have taken a theoretical approach. However, this Article — also appropriating the “Law of the Horse” moniker — concludes that Easterbrook’s challenge is primarily pedagogical, requiring a response keyed to whether cyberlaw ought to be taught in law schools. The Article concludes that despite Easterbrook’s concerns, cyberlaw presents a unique opportunity for legal educators to provide capstone learning experiences through role-playing simulations that unfold on the live Internet. In fact, cyberlaw is a subject particularly well-suited to learning through techniques that immerse students in the very technologies and networks that they are studying. In light of recommendations for educational reform contained in the recent studies Best Practices for Legal Education and the Carnegie Report, the Article examines the extent to which “Cybersimulations” are an ideal way for students to learn — in a holistic and immersive manner — legal doctrine, underlying theory, lawyering skills, and professional values.

them to act and appear as definite, bounded things in definite, bounded
spaces. Yet each school is also a process, a constant coming-into-being
enacted by students, staff and others. In this chapter, I argue that both
are useful ways of understanding school since they help to make sense of
the rich and varied activities that take place there. The successful
projection of school as a thing is therefore dependent on how the process
of school happens and is communicated. An aggregation and congealing of
space-times helps to promote one, particular, space over others and
transform a complex, heterogenous array of space-times into a phenomenon
more easily recognised as a thing with given physical and discursive
characteristics.*


*I use the concept of scales, downscaling and movement between scales after
Singh (this volume) to flag up a range of differing aggregations and
revealings of detail as a way of accounting for rather than simplifying
complexity (after Blommaert, 2015). I argue that scales afford useful
epistemological manoeuvrings that juxtapose different knowledges and can
produce second order knowledges in the process, what I call “analytic
friction”. If life requires some level of abstraction to make it
manageable, it is also the case that complexity can bring some clarity.
Analytic friction, gained in this example by moving between scales, can
both complexify and render communicable what school is and how it comes to

A central goal of modern science, objectivity, is a concept with a
documented history. Its meaning in any specific setting reflects
historically-situated understandings of both science and self. Recently,
various scientific fields have confronted growing mistrust about the
replicability of findings.  Statistical techniques familiar to forensic
investigations have been deployed to articulate a “crisis of false
positives.” In response, epistemic activists have invoked a decidedly
economic understanding of scientists’ selves. This has prompted a set of
proposed reforms including regulating disclosure of “backstage” research
details and enhancing incentives for replication. We argue that, together,
these events represent the emergence of a new formulation of objectivity.
Forensic objectivity assesses the integrity of research literatures in the
results observed in collections of studies rather than in the
methodological details of individual studies and, thus, positions
meta-analysis as the ultimate arbiter of scientific objectivity. Forensic
objectivity not only presents a challenge to scientific communities but
also raises new questions for the sociology of science.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:08.289649,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-10T23:12:03.209000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/citation/,2ft8x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ut657/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/relationships/node/,ut657,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57abb4c49ad5a101fd00c125/,57abb4c49ad5a101fd00c125,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ft8x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2ft8x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2ft8x

Children from advantaged backgrounds tend to obtain more education and consequently have higher status occupations as adults. Researchers often conceptualize the transition from school to work as discrete and the influence of education on employment characteristics as unidirectional. The goal of this research is to identify whether jobs during college are part of the status attainment process. First, it describes characteristics of student employment by family background, number of years in college, and season. College students from the most advantaged backgrounds have higher status jobs. Regardless of family background, students who have been college-enrolled for more years have higher levels of occupational status. Second, the analyses investigate the association between occupational status and college persistence. In typical college student jobs, employment (especially extensive employment) is negatively associated with college persistence. This negative association between employment and college persistence reverses, however, and becomes positive as occupational status increases.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,education|Employment|PAA2011|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:30.805163,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-10T22:06:44.812000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/citation/,76e3n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/afhtr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/relationships/node/,afhtr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57aba5766c613b01e90dbe2a/,57aba5766c613b01e90dbe2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76e3n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/76e3n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/76e3n

With this understanding in mind, the ""full scope"" and ""any mode"" language are easily reconciled: for any given target, one mode suffices.  But each and every target must be enabled.

Confronted with natural scientists’ and McCathythes’ accusations of
ideological bias, positive studies emphasizing that collective decisions
mechanisms were unstable and inefficient, and normative impossibilities,
economists largely relied on the idea the policy ends they worked with
reflected a “social consensus.” As the latter crumbled in the 1960s,
growing disagreement erupted on how to identify and aggregate those
individual values which economists believed should guide applied work, in
particular in cost-benefit analysis. The 1970s and 1980s brought new
approaches to collective decision: Arrow’s impossibility was solved by
expanding the informational basis, it was showed that true preferences
could be revealed by making decision costly, and experimentalists and
market designers enabled these mechanisms to be tested in the lab before
being sold to those public bodies looking for decision procedures that
emulated markets. In this new regime, the focus paradoxically shifted to
coordination, revelation and efficiency, and those economists studying
collective decision processes were marginalized.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,collective decision|economics|History of Economics|Preprint|socarxiv|social welfare fuction|voting,2018-07-02T10:53:44.001345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-08T22:45:45.090000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/citation/,uxzfn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cr9a8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/relationships/node/,cr9a8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57cc51059ad5a101f21aa021/,57cc51059ad5a101f21aa021,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uxzfn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uxzfn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uxzfn
