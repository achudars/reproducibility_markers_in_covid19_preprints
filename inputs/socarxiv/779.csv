years ago, courts required affirmative evidence of agreement to form a
contract. No court had enforced a shrinkwrap license, much less treated a
unilateral statement of preferences as a binding agreement. Today, by
contrast, it seems widely (though not universally) accepted that if you
write a document and call it a contract, courts will enforce it as a
contract even if no one agrees to it. Every court to consider the issue has
found clickwrap licenses, in which a user clicks I agree to standard form
terms, enforceable. A majority of courts in the last ten years have
enforced shrinkwrap licenses, on the theory that people agree to the terms
by using the software they have already purchased. Finally, and more
recently, an increasing number of courts have enforced browsewrap licenses,
in which the user does not see the contract at all but in which the license
terms provide that using a Web site constitutes agreement to a contract
whether the user knows it or not. Collectively, we can call these
agreements terms of use because they control (or purport to control) the
circumstances under which buyers of software or visitors to a public Web
site can make use of that software or site.

The rise of terms of use has drawn a great deal of attention because of the
mass-market nature of the resulting agreements. Terms of use are drafted
with consumers or other small end users in mind. Commentators - myself
among them - have focused on the impact of this new form of contract on
consumers. But in the long run they may have their most significant impact
not on consumers but on businesses. The law has paid some attention to the
impact of terms of use on consumers. Virtually all of the cases that have
refused to enforce a browsewrap license have done so in order to protect
consumers; conversely, virtually all the cases that have enforced
browsewrap licenses have done so against a commercial entity. And
shrinkwrap and clickwrap cases, while enforcing some contracts against
consumers, have protected those consumers against certain clauses
considered unreasonable. Businesses, however, are presumed to know what
they are doing when they access another company's Web site, so courts are
more likely to bind them to that site's terms of use. Sophisticated
economic entities are unlikely to persuade a court that a term is
unconscionable. And because employees are agents whose acts bind the
corporation, the proliferation of terms of use means that a large company
is likely agreeing to dozens or even hundreds of different contracts every
day, merely by using the Internet. And because no one ever reads those
terms of use, those multiple contracts are likely to have a variety of
different terms that create obligations inconsistent with each other and
with the company's own terms of use.

We have faced a situation like this before, decades ago. As
business-to-business commerce became more common in the middle of the 20th
Century, companies began putting standard contract terms on the back of
their purchase orders and shipment invoices. When each side to a contract
used such a form, courts had to confront the question of whose form
controlled. After unsuccessful judicial experimentation with a variety of
rules, the Uniform Commercial Code resolved this battle of the forms by
adopting a compromise under which if the terms conflicted, neither party's
terms became part of the contract unless the party demonstrated its
willingness to forego the deal over it. Rather, the default rules of
contract law applied where the parties' standard forms disagreed, but where
neither party in fact insisted on those terms.

I have three goals in this paper. First, I explain how courts came to
enforce browsewrap licenses, at least in some cases. Second, I suggest that
if browsewraps are to be enforceable at all, enforcement should be limited
to the context in which it has so far occurred - against sophisticated
commercial entities who are repeat players. Finally, I argue that even in
that context the enforcement of browsewraps creates problems for common
practice that need to be solved. Business-to-business (b2b) terms of use
are the modern equivalent of the battle of the forms. We need a parallel
solution to this battle of the terms. In Part I, I describe the development
of the law to the point where assent is no longer even a nominal element of
a contract. In Part II, I explain how the recent decisions concerning
browsewrap licenses likely bind businesses but not consumers, and the
problems that will create for commercial litigation. Finally, in Part III,
I discuss possible ways to solve this coming problem and some broader
implications the problem may have for browsewrap licenses generally.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:10.923470,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:11:39.419000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/citation/,gf4st,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuqks/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/relationships/node/,zuqks,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcca1c6c613b01ebd9320d/,57bcca1c6c613b01ebd9320d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gf4st/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gf4st

system is that due to continuation practice it is impossible for the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) ever to finally reject a patent
application. Continuation applications have led to abuse of the patent
prosecution process. They serve very little useful purpose, and what
benefits they confer may be outweighed by their potential for mischief. In
an effort to study the pervasiveness of continuation practice, we compiled
an original dataset comprising 2,224,379 patents, every patent issued from
1976 through 2000. We found that while continuations are filed in 23% of
all patent applications, patents based on continuation applications
represent 52% of all litigated patents. Although continuations are used in
a minority of all patents, it is the most important minority because it is
the minority most likely to end up in litigation. We examine the efforts
undertaken to control the problems associated with continuation patents
(changing the patent term, publishing applications, prosecution laches) and
find them insufficient. The world would probably be a better place if they
were abolished. Recognizing, however, that the abuse of continuation
practice is not as pervasive as some might think, we propose a number of
means by which Congress and the courts could strengthen existing rules
designed to limit their abuse while preserving the practice. At a minimum,
the empirical data we present can provide litigants and judges with a
baseline for assessing the reasonableness of delay caused by the filing of
multiple continuations by the patentee in determining the applicability of
equitable remedies such as prosecution laches.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:08.101886,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:10:22.667000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/citation/,2fecd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ut8f4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/relationships/node/,ut8f4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc9d06c613b01ecd932a4/,57bcc9d06c613b01ecd932a4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2fecd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2fecd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2fecd

Office has no way of identifying the small number of applications that are
likely to end up having real economic significance. Thus patent
applications are for the most part treated alike, with every application
getting the same - and by necessity sparse - review. In this short magazine
piece, we urge in response three basic reforms. First, we would weaken the
presumption of validity that today attaches to all issued patents. The
modern strong presumption simply does not reflect the reality of patent
review; presumptions, in short, should be earned. Second, because
legitimate inventors need as much certainty as the law can provide, we
would give applicants the option of earning a presumption of validity by
paying for a thorough examination of their inventions. Put differently,
applicants should be allowed to ""gold-plate"" their patents by paying for
the kind of searching review that would merit a strong presumption of
validity. Third and finally, because competitors also have useful
information about which patents worry them and which do not, we support
instituting a post-grant opposition system, a process by which parties
other than the applicant would have the opportunity to request and fund a
thorough examination of a recently issued patent. As we explain in the
piece, these reforms would together allow the Patent Office to focus its
resources on patents that might actually matter, and it would also both
reduce the incentive to file patents of questionable validity and reduce
the harm caused by such patents in any event.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:48.957520,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:07:50.499000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/citation/,px9g5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8bgtu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/relationships/node/,8bgtu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc9379ad5a101fa68d554/,57bcc9379ad5a101fa68d554,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/px9g5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/px9g5

patents - have a disproportionate effect on the patent system. They are
responsible for a sizeable fraction of all patent lawsuits. Their patents
should be among the strongest, according to all economic measures of patent
quality. And logic suggests that repeat patent plaintiffs should be risk
averse, settling more of their cases and taking only the very best to trial
to avoid having their patents invalidated. In this paper, we test those
hypotheses. We find that repeat patent plaintiffs are somewhat more likely
to settle their cases. But, to our surprise, we find that when they do go
to trial or judgment, overwhelmingly they lose. This result seems to be
driven by two parallel findings: both software patents and patents owned by
non-practicing entities (so-called ""patent trolls"") fare extremely poorly

literature. Unfortunately, most of that attention has been devoted to the
problem of whether software is or should be patentable subject matter. With
roughly 40,000 software patents already issued, and the Federal Circuit
endorsing patentability without qualification, those questions are for the
history books. The more pressing questions now concern the scope to be
accorded software patents. In this paper, we examine the implications of
some traditional patent law doctrines for innovation in the software
industry. We argue that patent law needs some refinement if it is to
promote rather than impede the growth of this new market, which is
characterized by rapid sequential innovation, reuse and re-combination of
components, and strong network effects that privilege interoperable
components and products. In particular, we argue for two sorts of new rules
in software patent cases.

First, we advocate a limited right to reverse engineer patented computer
programs in order to gain access to and study those programs and to
duplicate their unprotected elements. Such a right is firmly established in
copyright law, and seems unexceptional as a policy matter even in patent
law. But because patent law contains no fair use or reverse engineering
exemption, patentees could use the grant of rights on a single component of
a complex program to prevent any ""making"" or ""using"" of the program as a
whole, including those temporary uses needed in reverse engineering. While
patent law does contain doctrines of ""experimental use"" and ""exhaustion,""
it is not at all clear that those doctrines will protect legitimate reverse
engineering efforts. We suggest that if these doctrines cannot be read
broadly enough to establish such a right, Congress should create a limited
right to reverse engineer software containing patented components for
research purposes.

Second, we argue that in light of the special nature of innovation within
the software industry, courts should apply the doctrine of equivalents
narrowly in infringement cases. The doctrine of equivalents allows a
finding of infringement even when the accused product does not literally
satisfy each element of the patent, if there is substantial equivalence as
to each element. The test of equivalence is the known interchangeability of
claimed and accused elements at the time of (alleged) infringement. A
number of factors unique to software and the software industry - a culture
of reuse and incremental improvement, a lack of reliance on systems of
formal documentation used in other technical fields, the short effective
life of software innovations, and the inherent plasticity of code -
severely complicate post hoc assessments of the ""known interchangeability""
of software elements. A standard for equivalence of code elements that
ignores these factors risks stifling legitimate, successful efforts to
design around existing software patents. To avoid this danger, courts
should construe software claims narrowly, and should refuse a finding of
equivalence if the accused element is ""interchangeable"" with prior art that
should have narrowed the original patent, or if the accused improvement is
too many generations removed from the original invention.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:05.835687,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T21:49:14.772000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/citation/,rmtx4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/msqey/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/relationships/node/,msqey,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc4dc6c613b01e9d931bb/,57bcc4dc6c613b01e9d931bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmtx4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rmtx4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rmtx4

trial. These settlements involve agreements between the patentee and the
accused infringer, parties who are often competitors before the lawsuit.
Because these competitors may agree to stop competing, to regulate the
price each charges, and to exchange information about products and prices,
settlements of intellectual property disputes naturally raise antitrust
concerns. In this paper, we suggest a way to reconcile the interests of
intellectual property law and antitrust law in evaluating intellectual
property settlements. In Part I, we provide background on the issue. Part
II argues that in most cases courts can determine the legality of a
settlement agreement without inquiring into the merits of the intellectual
property dispute being settled, either because the settlement would be
legal even if the patent were invalid or not infringed, or because the
settlement would be illegal even if the patent were valid and infringed.
Only in a narrow class of cases will the merits of the intellectual
property dispute matter. In Part III, we argue that in that narrow middle
set of cases antitrust's rule of reason is unlikely to be helpful. Rather,
courts must inquire into the validity, enforceability, and infringement
issues in the underlying case, with particular sensitivity to both the type
of intellectual property right at issue and the industrial context of the
dispute. In Part IV, we apply our framework to a number of common
settlement terms, most notably the use of exclusion payments to settle
pharmaceutical patent disputes. We argue that exclusion payments that
exceed litigation costs should be deemed illegal per se. There is no
legitimate reason for such payments, and the most likely reason - to permit
the patentee to exclude competition that would likely have occurred absent
the payment - is anticompetitive. Further, legitimate patent disputes can
be settled in other ways than with an exclusion payment - for example, by
licensing the defendant or by agreeing to delay entry.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:32.741425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T21:45:35.249000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/citation/,dnv59,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cwxak/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/relationships/node/,cwxak,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc400b83f6901f8655eed/,57bcc400b83f6901f8655eed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dnv59/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dnv59/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dnv59

of examining patents, and that it should spend more time and money weeding
out bad patents. In this article, Professor Lemley challenges that
conventional wisdom. Using available data regarding the cost and incidence
of patent prosecution, litigation, licensing and other uses of patents, he
demonstrates that strengthening the examination process is not cost
effective. The core insight is that very few patents are actually litigated
or licensed; most simply sit on a shelf unused, or are used only for
noncontroversial purposes like financing. Because of this, society would be
better off spending its resources in a more searching judicial inquiry into
validity in those few cases in which it matters than paying for a more
protracted examination of all patents ex ante. In economic terms, the
patent office is ""rationally ignorant"" of the objective validity of the
patents it issues.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:43.895959,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T18:42:07.960000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/citation/,n3gre,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cxmfc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/relationships/node/,cxmfc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc99029ad5a101f668d66a/,57bc99029ad5a101f668d66a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n3gre/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n3gre/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n3gre

environment, the real stakes lie in suing those who facilitate infringement
by others. There is of course a good reason copyright owners are filing
such suits. They see themselves as under threat from a flood of cheap, easy
copies and a dramatic increase in the number of people who can make those
copies. The high volume of illegal uses, and the low return to suing any
individual, make it more cost-effective to aim as far up the chain as
possible. From the perspective of the movie industry, it's easier and more
effective to shut down Napster than to sue the millions of people who
traded files illegally on Napster. So far, the courts have been willing to
go along, shutting down a number of innovative services in the digital
music realm.

In this article, we argue that unrestricted liability for anyone who is in
any way involved with copyright infringement is a bad idea. Indirect
liability is a continuum, in which acts most closely related to
infringement and with the fewest affirmative benefits are the easiest to
condemn. Going after makers of technology for the uses to which their
technologies may be put threatens to stifle innovation. The fundamental
difficulty is that while courts can make decisions about direct
infringement on a case-by-case basis, lawsuits based on indirect liability
necessarily sweep together both socially beneficial and socially harmful
uses of a program or service, either permitting both uses or condemning
both.

Optimal digital copyright policy would do two things: stop deterring
innovators, and permit cost-effective enforcement of copyright in the
digital environment. In this paper, we suggest at least two possible
alternatives that might provide ways out of the digital copyright morass.
Both alternatives stem from the basic economics of copyright enforcement.
It is not currently cost-effective for copyright owners to sue individual
infringers, because there are tens of millions of them, because lawsuits
are expensive, and because each infringer would be liable only for minimal
damages. They are happy to sue facilitators instead, because there are
fewer of them and both damages and the benefits of injunctive relief are
substantial. Copyright owners have no incentive to permit optimal
innovation by facilitators, because they do not benefit from that
innovation except indirectly. Individual infringers in turn have no
incentive to change their behavior or to subscribe to fee-based services,
because they suffer none of the costs of infringement.

One solution is to change the incentives of individuals. Because individual
users of peer-to-peer (p2p) networks know that it is extremely unlikely
they will be sued, economic theory suggests that the only way to
effectively deter infringement is to increase the effective sanction
substantially for those who are caught. Were the government to begin
criminally prosecuting selected users of peer-to-peer services - or were
the RIAA to sue end users in earnest - it could have a substantial
deterrent effect on many illegal users. Selective prosecution has other
advantages as well - the government could target the relatively few
keystone providers of illegal files on p2p sites, and those are precisely
the users who are least likely to be engaged in fair use. While particular
prosecutions won't stop illegal file trading altogether, copyright owners
have never been able to prevent all piracy. All they need to do is reduce
piracy enough that they can make a return on their investment.

Another solution is to change the incentives of copyright owners to sue
individual infringers by reducing the cost of such a suit. One such
approach would be a levy system. Levies on equipment or services have the
virtue of permitting automatic collection of royalties, reducing the
enforcement cost dramatically, but at the cost of taxing legal as well as
illegal uses. A levy solves the enforcement problem at the front end, but
it is similar in many ways to the current approach of suing facilitators.
The main difference is that under a levy system the copyright owner is
protected by a compulsory license rather than a property rule.

An alternative proposal to reduce the cost of enforcement is to create some
sort of quick, cheap arbitration system that enables copyright owners to
get some limited relief against abusers of p2p systems. The existing domain
name trademark arbitration system is a model in some respects - its speed
and low cost - but a cautionary tale in others - its lack of process
protections. Such a system would permit low-cost enforcement of copyright
infringement against direct infringers, reducing the need for content
owners to sue facilitators. Relative to levies, an arbitration system would
trade off some increase in cost for accuracy, targeting only those making
illegal uses rather than all users of computers or p2p networks. It would
be fairer than selective criminal prosecution, because the burden would
fall more evenly on each wrongdoer, rather than imposing stark punishment
on a few in order to serve society's interest in deterring the rest. The
system could also be designed to improve accuracy relative to the binary
choice the courts face in indirect infringement cases today. We could
design the system so that it is limited to clear cases. We could also build
in a defense for arguable fair uses, so that a user who could prove they
were space-shifting CDs they already own would have a defense.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:43.982441,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T18:40:41.074000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/citation/,n4863,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r3msp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/relationships/node/,r3msp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bc98aa594d900201d0d9cf/,57bc98aa594d900201d0d9cf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n4863/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n4863/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n4863
