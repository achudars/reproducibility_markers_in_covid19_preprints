I subject this debate to an analysis in order to separate productive from destructive discursive strategies.  I find that both FGC and the literature about the practice are frequently mischaracterized in consequential ways.  Especially prior to the mid-1990s, scholars frame FGC as an example of either cultural inferiority or cultural difference.  In the 1990s, postcolonial scholars contest the framing of FGC as a measure of cultural inferiority.  However, they often argue that Western feminist engagement with FGCs, writ large, is ‘imperialist.’  I contend that both accusations of African ‘barbarism’ and of Western feminist ‘imperialism’ are empirically false and inflammatory.  Furthermore, reifying ‘African’ and ‘Western’ perspectives erases African opposition to FGC and Western feminist acknowledgement of transnational power asymmetry.

To investigate this, I analyze a debate over whether we should relieve the “cultural need” for infibulation among immigrants by offering a “nick” in U.S. hospitals.  Using interviews, newspaper coverage, and primary documents, I show that physicians and opponents of the procedure with contrasting models of culture disagreed on whether it represented cultural change.  Opponents argued that the “nick” was fairly described as “female genital mutilation” and symbolically identical to more extensive cutting. Using a reified model, they imagined Somalis to be “culture-bound”; the adoption of a “nick” was simply a move from one genital cutting procedure to another. Unable to envision meaningful cultural adaptation, and presupposing the incompatibility of multiculturalism and feminism, they supported forced assimilation. Physicians, drawing on a dynamic model of culture, believed that adoption of the “nick” was meaningful cultural change, but overly idealized their ability to protect Somali girls from both Somali and U.S. patriarchy.

Individuals in new contexts are understood to face disadvantage, making disruption of a hierarchical status quo difficult.

Here I examine a community of lindy hoppers who are re-shaping the collective body towards feminist ends.  Control over bodies is essential to partner dance.  However, these dancers revision the lead/follow dynamic.  Instead of an active/passive binary, partners happily negotiate power.  This negotiation is decidedly corporeal and cooperative and occurs spontaneously and constantly.

With an analysis of newspaper coverage supplemented by interviews and primary documents, I find that, in contrast to existing literature that shows that reporters must refrain from issue advocacy, when consensus is widespread reporters can and do collaborate with advocates, harmonize with opinion writers, and use their physical presence and access to newsprint to pressure the state.

We argue that the authors undersell the importance of their findings, especially considering shifts in the content and ubiquitousness of mass media. Advances in communication technologies have enabled a new era of objectification, marked by an increasing presence and acceptance of sexual objectification in media, greater pornographic content in mainstream media, and greater acceptance of pornography in U.S. society more broadly. In the years since U.S. scholars began critiquing sexual objectification, its normalization and degree of penetration into our daily lives have increased, largely due to a proliferation of marketing and entertainment media images enabled by the Internet and other communication technology. Given this new era of objectification, we conclude that the phenomenon identified by Heflick and Goldenberg is more likely to influence the success of female politicians now than it was in the 1970s (when the sexual objectification of women was first problematized) and that it may also help explain the recent stagnation in U.S. progress towards gender equity in political representation.",TRUE,FALSE,female politicians|gender|internet|media|politics|pornography|sarah palin|sexism|sexual objectification,2018-07-02T11:08:05.983533,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-24T05:06:06.785047,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/citation/,g6rct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tcgjb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/relationships/node/,tcgjb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599e5e5bb83f690259165e7d/,599e5e5bb83f690259165e7d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6rct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6rct/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6rct

We explore a series of hypotheses to explain this sexual paradigm shift, including: college and university policies; the gender distribution of students; changes in the nature of alcohol use; access to and consumption of pornography; the increased sexual content of non-pornographic media; rising self-objectification and narcissism; new marriage norms; and perceptions of sexual risk.  We then recommend new directions for research, emphasizing the need to explore structural and psychological as well as cultural factors, the role of discrete events alongside slowly-emerging social change, the need for intersectional research and studies of non-college-attending and post-college youth, and the benefits of longitudinal and cross-college designs.",TRUE,FALSE,alcohol|college|cultural sociology|culture|gender|higher education|hooking up|hookup culture|literature review|mental health|pornography|sex|sexual cultures|sexuality|well-being,2018-07-02T11:08:05.937681,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-24T04:56:17.507351,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/citation/,hng5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6da84/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/relationships/node/,6da84,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599e5bc36c613b0253365409/,599e5bc36c613b0253365409,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hng5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hng5v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hng5v

Sexuality (i.e., sexual orientation), however, is not as central a factor by which we conceptualize and systematize society. This study examines the impact of sexual orientation, gender, race, and education across attitudinal topics covered by the General Social Survey. Sexual orientation is an important part of people’s lives that, as I demonstrate, is a strong and exceptionally consistent predictor of social attitudes across issues regardless of whether it is measured with partnering behavior or self-identification. When sexual behavior and identity differ, however, identity is more influential. This pattern lends support to a marginalized identity explanation for why sexual minorities are consistently liberal. I conclude that future work should pay more attention to sexuality as a core factor in social scientific theory and empirical analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:08:05.580657,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-23T19:24:13.833962,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/citation/,73xsz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/saq7u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/relationships/node/,saq7u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599dd610594d90025b52fdf5/,599dd610594d90025b52fdf5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73xsz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/73xsz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/73xsz

The literature, however, has typically under-emphasized gender theory, paid insufficient attention to variation across different contexts, and failed to consider styles of religious expression. This study draws on gender theory, brings religion and political attitudes research into dialogue, and explores potential gender differences in religious dogmatism (e.g., religious absolutism, exclusivity, and intolerance). Using U.S. data from the Baylor Religion Survey and cross-national data from the International Social Survey Programme, I demonstrate that women are generally more religious, but less dogmatic. As expected based on gender theory, however, the patterns I uncover are not universal and vary by societal context (i.e., Christian vs. non-Christian nations). I argue that religion appears to be a gendered sphere like any other in which we express our gendered selves, and that gender gaps in religion are the result not of essential differences, but of context-specific gender regimes, religion regimes, and the simultaneous “doing” of both gender and religion.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes|Gender|Politics|Religion,2018-07-02T11:08:05.469702,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-23T19:03:22.745513,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/citation/,tf76d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/khdzv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/relationships/node/,khdzv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599dd11c594d900259537ec6/,599dd11c594d900259537ec6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf76d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tf76d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tf76d

This has meant exposing parts of the energy sector, such as power generation, to competitive entry, while keeping its other parts, such as electricity grids, intact as regional monopolies operating alongside liberalised energy markets. Inspired by earlier studies on economization and valuative regimes, this paper investigates the calculative framings of such transitions, using the Norwegian case as an example. We argue that it constitutes an interesting example of economization, but in a non-traditional sense. Because vital parts of the grid sector remained publicly regulated monopolies, we find the transition included a shift in governing logic from one soundly rooted in engineering and controlled by elected politicians to one influenced chiefly by economics and controlled by complex calculative regimes in which elected officials are studiously hands-off. This economization has had significant implications for the degree of democratic control over vital societal infrastructure. Thus, we argue that processes of economization that operate outside of straightforward privatization should be further studied in order to grasp clearer their implication in modern, liberal societies.",TRUE,FALSE,calculative techniques|economisation|energy infrastructure|science studies,2018-07-02T11:08:04.554721,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-23T09:19:29.489470,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/citation/,xgty9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599d47d16c613b02550a3e45/,599d47d16c613b02550a3e45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgty9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xgty9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xgty9
