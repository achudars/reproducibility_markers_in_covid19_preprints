substantial overhaul of the patent system in the past sixty years. The most
significant change in the AIA was the move from a first to invent regime to
a first inventor to file regime. The goal of the move to first to file,
besides harmonization, is to encourage inventors to move with alacrity to
share their invention with the world.

There is an ambiguity in the AIA, however, that threatens that disclosure
objective. Some commentators have argued that Congress intended to
fundamentally change the rules of prior art in a way that would encourage
secrecy rather than disclosure. Under this interpretation of the new law,
an inventor can use its process in secret for commercial purposes,
potentially forever, and still file a patent on that invention at some
point in the future. Far from encouraging disclosure, on this
interpretation the effect of the AIA is to encourage secrecy and delay in
patenting. Curiously, the argument is that Congress signaled its intent to
make this fairly radical change by re-enacting language that had been in
the Patent Act for the last 140 years: the words ""public use.""

Because two of these commentators, Bob Armitage and Joe Matal, were
involved in the drafting of the AIA, this argument has carried substantial
weight, and the PTO in 2013 adopted regulations that read the term ""public
use"" in the AIA as meaning something completely different than it had for
the century before 2011.

In this paper, I make two points. First, as a matter of statutory
interpretation it is unlikely that Congress intended to make such a change,
not only because they readopted existing statutory language but because
other parts of the statute make no sense under such an interpretation.
Second, reading the AIA as making such a change would be unwise as a policy
matter, not only because it would encourage secrecy but because it would
undermine confidence that other terms reenacted in the AIA have the same
meaning they have accrued in decades of common law.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:50.789565,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-01T17:29:22.991000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/citation/,xcebj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/js4gm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/relationships/node/,js4gm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c86574b83f6901e6cd7ee8/,57c86574b83f6901e6cd7ee8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xcebj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xcebj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xcebj

number of inventors have complained that the new patent term may reduce
patent protection because some applications spend a number of years in
“prosecution” before the PTO. Under the old law, delay in processing an
application did not hurt the patentee, but under the new rule, each day
spent in prosecuting the patent is a day of protection lost.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a neutral and systematic way
the likely effects of the new law. I conclude that on average, and for most
industries, the new law gives more protection to patentees than the old
law. However, there is some question as to whether the biotechnology
industry will receive less protection under the new law. I conclude that
there is no significant relationship between the length of time a patent
spends in prosecution and whether it will be judged valid in the courts.

they argue that we get innovation from competition, not monopoly. Further,
because monopoly imposes well-recognized social costs, we are better off
without it if it doesn’t in fact spur new innovation.

Boldrin and Levine make a plausible case on their own terms. Nonetheless, I
think their terms are misleading. IP rights are rarely if ever
“intellectual monopolies.” Most patents, to say nothing of most copyrights,
create no economic rents. What this means is that we can’t assume that IP
rights generally impose deadweight losses on society. They cause deviation
from atomistic, perfect competition, but they don’t cause monopoly pricing.
With a small number of exceptions, therefore, they don’t cause the social

affects decisionmaking in patent cases. We find that that there is a
strong, statistically significant relationship between a judge’s experience
and case outcome: more experienced judges are less likely to rule for the
patentee. Notably, the relationship exists for rulings finding
noninfringement; judicial experience had no relationship to the likelihood
a judge would find a patent invalid. The relationship appears to hold
across judges, rather than to be driven by the rulings of particular
judges. Beyond individual judges, some technologies (biotechnology,
mechanics) are associated with more patentee wins, while patentees are less
likely to win computer hardware and software cases. Some district courts
(Delaware, New Jersey) are more likely to find patents infringed. By
contrast, perhaps surprisingly, we find no significant relationship between
litigation in the Eastern District of Texas and a judge’s ruling for or
against the patentee. Finally, we find that suing on multiple patents is
associated with an increased likelihood that at least one patent will be
found to be infringed.

Our results challenge what has been an implicit assumption in the
literature and discussion that particular districts are biased in a
particular direction, driving forum shopping. And they test for the first
time the implicit assumption in the literature, in calls for specialized
patent trial courts, and in the Patent Pilot Program, that experience with
patent cases at the trial level will lead to different — usually assumed to
be “better” — outcomes from what we see from generalist courts. Our results
suggest that there is a difference, but that “better” may be in the eye of
the beholder. They suggest some sort of learning effect among district
court judges across the country, and that patentees benefit from litigating
before inexperienced judges, at least on issues of infringement. Depending
on the reason for this effect, adoption of a specialized patent trial court
might help accused infringers but not patentees, raising broader questions
