A particular attention has been focused on the coherence of their production of argumentative texts. Employing a discourse analytical case study, three texts written by three Master’s degree students of the English language education at a local university in Central Java, Indonesia, were analyzed. Coherence and cohesion is inextricable in which both are crucial in academic writing as to achieve a makes-sense text. Therefore, it is an urgent need to look at the writing competency of students as they are at graduate level, majoring in the English language education. The texts produced by the students were scrutinized through the lens of micro- and macro-level coherence (Thornburry, 2005). From this theory, cohesion is involved in micro level coherence. The findings indicate that the students show a bit weakness on achieving coherent texts due to lack of optimization of cohesive devices especially conjunctions to create interconnectedness of the whole sentences in the texts.",TRUE,FALSE,argumentative text|coherence|cohesion|graduate students|written discourse analysis,2018-07-02T11:15:53.950931,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T00:06:24.394935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/citation/,2zpsm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j58x4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/relationships/node/,j58x4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3f7609ad5a102b5890f02/,59e3f7609ad5a102b5890f02,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zpsm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2zpsm/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.17,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2zpsm

However, in recent years, various studies have shown that proper strategies in acquiring new words could be one of the keys to effective language learning among EFL learners. This study investigates how Sudanese EFL learners at Khartoum University, Sudan use and evaluate vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs). The three selected categories of vocabulary learning strategies - metacognitive, discovery, and consolidation - were chosen according to taxonomies proposed by Al-Fuhaid (2004), Schmitt (1997) and Nation (2001).  These VLSs were then evaluated using Han’s Information Processing Theory and Craik and Lockhart’s Depth of Processing Theory (1972) to meet the two objectives of this study. The first objective was to examine the most frequently used VLSs employing a set questionnaire designed to elicit the necessary data. The second objective was to evaluate the usefulness of each of these VLSs by conducting in-depth interviews with the respondents. The results showed that metacognitive strategies were the most frequently used VLS among the three. In-depth interview data revealed that respondents evaluated all three VLS positively and considered them very useful in acquiring as well as understanding words. These findings suggest that language learners in Sudan should be taught vocabulary enhancing techniques while language instructors should use and teach these VLS to learners explicitly.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language|vocabulary learning|vocabulary learning strategies,2018-07-02T11:15:53.904846,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-16T00:02:43.591202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/citation/,qpn8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w7hfv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/relationships/node/,w7hfv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3f633594d9002b0c5e223/,59e3f633594d9002b0c5e223,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qpn8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qpn8t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.16,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qpn8t

However, this relationship remained under-explored. This study would address two key research questions: (1) How did learners of English as a foreign language paraphrase texts and (2) How were their attitudes towards plagiarism. Data were drawn from texts produced by undergraduate students of English Department in reading comprehension classes. Two stages of analyses were carried out. Firstly description of quality of paraphrasing the texts by the learners were presented and distributed. Secondly, the learners’ attitudes towards plagiarism were described. These analyses were used as starting point to interpret the student plagiarism. Findings and discussion revealed that 20% of the learners’ works were 100% unique. They agreed to say that plagiarizing was as bad as stealing an exam and that plagiarism impoverished the investigative spirit. The rest were plagiarized ranging from 5% up to 24%. They said that sometimes they felt tempted to plagiarize because so many other students were doing it.  They argued sometimes they copied a sentence or two just to become inspired for further writing. Pedagogically, it implies that since paraphrasing is using one’s own words to express someone else's ideas, students should be encouraged to cite a source accurately and define unfamiliar words instead of being punished. They need to change any words or phrases that match the original so closely.

The study was conducted in Soran town, in the northern part of Iraq. The participants of the study were 58 EFL teachers from secondary and high school classrooms. In the first phase, a five-point Likert-scale questionnaire was administered (Karavas-Doukas, 1996) to examine the participants’ attitudes towards CLT principles: “place/importance of grammar, group/pair work, quality and quantity of error correction, the role of the teacher in the classroom, the role and contribution of learners in the learning process.” The second phase of the study was qualitative and consisted of semi-structured interviews to examine the reasons behind the implementation of CLT in terms of the factors that hinder and encourage the implementation of CLT in the Iraqi setting. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that the teachers held overall positive attitudes towards the use of CLT. The findings of the interview phase concluded that the main factors that cause the failure and success of the implementation of CLT in Iraq can be categorized under four headings: educational factors, teacher factors, student factors, and CLT factors.

However, its use is quite restricted in the Algerian secondary school. Thus, instead of playing a formative role, the assessment found in the Algerian EFL classroom is of a summative nature. Accordingly, the purpose behind the current research is to shed light on the importance of formative assessment in the teaching and learning processes by highlighting its effect on text comprehension, as the latter may be an obstacle to effective language learning and academic achievement among Algerian secondary school pupils. To reach this end, the present research attempts to investigate the impact of formative assessment on pupils’ text comprehension as well as their achievement and attitudes through answering the following research questions: (1) how does formative assessment develop pupils’ text comprehension? (2) What changes can the experiment bring in terms of students’ achievements and attitudes towards text comprehension? This research is based on a quasi-experimental design delivered to sixteen third year secondary school pupils as the latter are required to sit for the ‘Baccalaureate’ exam in which text comprehension is of crucial importance. A pretest, a posttest, an intervention which lasted five weeks and a questionnaire were used to find out the impact of formative assessment on the development of pupil’s text comprehension. The results obtained showed a significant progress in pupils’ outcomes in the four language competences: grammatical, textual, functional and sociolinguistic and namely in grammatical and textual competences.

Additionally, this study aims to evaluate the way in which three co-variables – vocabulary knowledge (VK), word recognition (WR) and working memory (WM) – contribute to individual differences in listening comprehension. The subjects of this study, 44 female students studying on an English programme at the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), were placed in two groups and taught a range of listening comprehension strategies, in accordance with the MetSBM and the mainstream CSBM. Seven pre- and post-tests were used (a listening comprehension test (LCT), vocabulary knowledge tests (VKK1 and VKK2), the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire (MALQ), an Aural Word Recognition test (AWR), an Orthographic Word Recognition test (OWR), a Working Memory Span test (WMS). This study considers three questions: (1) Is metacognitive teaching likely to lead to higher listening comprehension scores than the teaching of cognitive strategies, (2) Are students in the control group likely to develop metacogntive strategies on their own, and (3) Are there other variables that are likely to contribute to listening comprehension. The results suggest that the MetSBM is more effective in teaching and learning how to listen for comprehension than the CSBM. In addition, other variables – OWR, AWR, and WM contribute to listening comprehension. A number of recommendations to teachers, material developers, and researchers are provided.

Results of an in-depth content analysis of post-lesson written reflections (n = 1511), mentor feedback (n = 1624) and end-of-each-practicum reports (n = 337) reveal 23 frequent problems with teaching methodology, class control and time management as the top concerns.

However, studies that looked into the relevancy of those principles are rather limited. Thus, this study focuses on finding the common practices of vocabulary teaching and learning principles in the classroom. Interviews involving three experts were done to determine their vocabulary teaching and learning principles application in their teaching. Based on the data analysed using Atlas t.i, out of ten Vocabulary Teaching and Learning Principles, only eight were practiced by the participants. The findings revealed that these experts, even though practice the principles, the approaches were varied. Finally, the data points to the need for future studies on the importance of having good vocabulary instructions in teaching and learning vocabulary.",TRUE,FALSE,principles|vocabulary|vocabulary teaching and learning,2018-07-02T11:15:53.535320,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-15T21:51:39.017501,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/citation/,fwv6k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/86thb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/relationships/node/,86thb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3d781594d9002b0c5d72f/,59e3d781594d9002b0c5d72f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwv6k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fwv6k/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fwv6k

It also aims at evaluating the effectiveness of the online activities, from the students’ perspective, in regard to their in-class language learning skills; reading, writing, listening, speaking, and vocabulary building. The sample for this study is 200 undergraduate students at BZU who were placed at English Intermediate I level. A questionnaire was given to the students during the second month of their second semester. The overall results of the students’ responses showed inconclusive attitude towards online homework. Only 22.5% of the students thought it was more helpful than traditional homework. While an average of 66% of students’ responses showed that the online homework was beneficial to their in-class language skills activities; reading, vocabulary, and listening; an average of 48% only stated that it was effective in improving their writing skills. In addition, the written comments on the online program provided by a total of 141 students showed a negative attitude towards the online homework program with only 20% who stated that it was beneficial to their language learning.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|Cambridge Learning Management System|Cambridge Unlock online workbooks|language learning|online homework,2018-07-02T11:15:53.485399,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-15T21:46:42.098831,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/citation/,qp3em,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9pgf2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/relationships/node/,9pgf2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e3d69c9ad5a102b489bc20/,59e3d69c9ad5a102b489bc20,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qp3em/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qp3em/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no3.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qp3em
