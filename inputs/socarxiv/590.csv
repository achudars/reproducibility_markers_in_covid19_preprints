Social anthropologists have written nuanced ethnographies of how the environmental projects of governments and transnational NGOs encounter, dispossess, clash culturally with, and try to govern native people across the world. Yet, these diverse ethnographies often say little about what motivates those encounters firstly: local and global nature, especially wildlife, plants, and the planet’s ecological crisis. Thus, this paper seeks ways how ethnographic writing on conservation practice could better reflect that the planet’s many self-willed, struggling, and valued non-humans, too, enter conservation’s encounters. To find paths toward such a ‘wild-ing’ of ethnography, the paper locates and reviews disparate materials from across the social-anthropological literature on biodiversity conservation. The review is structured through three questions: How does and could the ethnography of conservation represent nature’s value? How can it show that animals, plants, and other nature make and meet worlds? How can it incorporate natural science data about non-human worlds and ecological crisis? Altogether, we understand nature conservation clearer through the interdisciplinary and more-than-human ethnography of world-making encounters. Such wilder ethnography may also better connect people’s suffering and nature’s vanishing – as problems both for anthropology and conservation science.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:53:26.730917,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T18:38:05.091435,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/citation/,5f4cp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3m72u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/relationships/node/,3m72u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b03c629e9cb340012b3334c/,5b03c629e9cb340012b3334c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5f4cp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5f4cp/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00664677.2018.1476222,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5f4cp

The more often students attend class and access on-campus learning resources, the better their grades and the lower their dropout rates. Despite the importance of on-campus participation in student outcomes, some students living in large cities face tremendous transportation and time-use barriers that make it difficult to spend more time on campus. Accordingly, the objective of our project is to examine the mobility factors that prevent students from attending their campuses in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Specifically, we examine student disparities in barriers to participate based on where they live, their mobility options, as well as the time constraints of their daily activity patterns (e.g. part time work). Data for our project is drawn from a 1-day travel survey of students across seven university campuses in the GTA. This is augmented with computationally derived transport accessibility factors. Multivariate logistic regression models are then employed to uncover the mobility-related determinants for a) if students feel commuting discourages them from travelling to campus; b) if students pick courses based on their commute; c) if commuting discourages students from participating in university organized activities; and d) how many days per week a student visits campus. The results of these models fuel a discussion of how to limit mobility-related barriers to postsecondary student participation.",TRUE,FALSE,activity participation|commuting|logistic regression|time use|university students,2018-07-02T11:53:26.061794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T18:31:17.509259,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/citation/,q652t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e7z35/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/relationships/node/,e7z35,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b035843a556d00014078808/,5b035843a556d00014078808,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q652t/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q652t

In the first half of the 20th century, natural re-source economics was firmly in Pinchot's side of that schism.  That position began to change as the post-war environmental movement gained momentum.  In particular, John Krutilla, an economist at Resources for the Future, pushed economics to the point that it could embrace Muir's vision as well as Pinchot's.

These widening class gaps are significant because parental investment is one pathway by which advantage is transmitted across generations. Using over three decades of micro-data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the American Heritage Time Use Survey linked to state-year measures of income inequality, we test the relationship between income inequality and class gaps in parental investment. We find robust evidence of wider class gaps in parental financial investments in children—but not parental time investments in children—when state-level income inequality is higher. We explore mechanisms that may drive the relationship between rising income inequality and widening class gaps in parental financial investments in children. This relationship is partially explained by the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution in state-years with higher inequality, which gives higher-earning households more money to spend on financial investments in children. In addition, we find evidence for contextual effects of higher income inequality that reshape parental preferences toward financial investment in children differentially by class.",TRUE,FALSE,family|inequality|parenting,2018-07-02T11:53:25.783670,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-21T22:32:40.411088,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/citation/,7gjdc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/628ku/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/relationships/node/,628ku,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b031b55e9cb340010b3ddd6/,5b031b55e9cb340010b3ddd6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7gjdc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7gjdc/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122418772034,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7gjdc

Indeed, Penny Dreadful is offered as a warning of a darker age to come. Accordingly, writer John Logan sets his series in a late Victorian, Gothicized London that serves as a microcosm for a contemporary Western world experiencing a psychological and spiritual disintegration that touches the individual and the larger culture. Logan calls attention to the anxieties generated by this disintegration by incorporating into his series characters from late Victorian Gothic fiction: Frankenstein and his creature, Dracula, the Wolf Man, Dorian Gray, and Dr. Jekyll. The individual and cultural anxieties suggested by these characters’ “monstrous” behaviors have their basis not only in their sexual dysfunctions but in their despair over God’s absence. This crisis is centered in sexually adventurous Vanessa Ives, whose attempts to return to the Christ Who has rejected her hold the series together. In the series’ final episode, just before her death, Vanessa has a vision of Jesus. In response to Vanessa’s death, most of the remaining characters are seized by an ennui that has its counterpart in our own culture. The suggestion is that Logan uses Vanessa Ives as a symbolic representation of a dying world view, which, somewhat ironically, provided for her remaining friends a hope that sustained them.",TRUE,FALSE,Gothic|John Logan|Media|Penny Dreadful|Television|TV,2018-07-02T11:53:24.565022,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-21T22:37:03.673468,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c90|Arts and Humanities|Television,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/citation/,g6ez4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h4ybt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/relationships/node/,h4ybt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b027640a556d0001306f4df/,5b027640a556d0001306f4df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ez4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ez4/,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/H4YBT,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ez4

Manx vernacular farmhouses, cottages, and farm buildings, alongside Manx sod hedges and small field structure, contribute to the ‘sense of place’. Current policy only allows for rural development in exceptional circumstances, which includes ‘replacement dwellings’, a policy mandating the clearance of existing rural development. There has been to date no assessment of the effectiveness of Manx planning policies at protecting built heritage within cultural landscapes. I created an evidence-based methodology with decision-trees to assess: (a) the completeness of policy implementation; and (b) its influence on decision-making. The method is demonstrated for the ‘replacement dwelling’ policy for the last 3.5 years. Public records were screened for relevance, with those remaining assigned policy assessment, compliance, and policy balance scores. Of 62 relevant applications, 58 had recommendations contrary to ‘replacement dwelling’ policy. In total, 50% of the replacement dwelling requirements were assessed by case officers in the applications. In particular, requirements establishing the principle of demolition / redevelopment (including protection for existing historic buildings) were only assessed with 23% completeness, and 14% compliance. 27 applications permitted demolition and replacement of vernacular buildings, including 17 farmhouses. Assessments of historic and architectural merit, required by policy, were uncommon, and only once was a conservation report obtained. The requirements for siting, size, and design of approved replacements were complied with 47% of the time, with 38% of these deemed ‘exceptional circumstances’. The evidence strongly suggests that policy application is inconsistent and incomplete, with the policies assessed here having no relation to the recommendations issued. Policy thus fails to provide protection to the historic buildings. I suggest that the method developed here could be used to overcome subjectivity in policy application, and allow performance tracking of individual policies.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural heritage|evidence-informed approach|rural planning|UNESCO biosphere,2018-07-02T11:53:23.222516,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-20T23:39:35.583670,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/citation/,7n9bd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nzk3p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/relationships/node/,nzk3p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b015bdae9cb340012b185ae/,5b015bdae9cb340012b185ae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7n9bd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7n9bd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7n9bd

Anime fans indicated whether they engaged in cosplaying or not, and rated the degree to which they disclose their anime fan identity to non-fans, satisfaction with life, self-esteem, and depression. Compared to non-cosplayers, cosplayers reported greater self-disclosure and better well-being across a number of indicators. Mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between cosplaying and well-being was consistently mediated by disclosure, a finding in-line with existing research. These are discussed within the context of existing research, providing both a conceptual replication of past findings from related fandoms (i.e., the furry fandom) while also suggesting a myriad of possible directions for future research on the subject.",TRUE,FALSE,anime|cosplay|cosplayers|satisfaction with life|well being|well-being,2018-07-02T11:53:22.875471,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-20T23:37:59.787524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/citation/,hujgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u96xw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/relationships/node/,u96xw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b01177ae9cb340011b14b79/,5b01177ae9cb340011b14b79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hujgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hujgs/,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HUJGS,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hujgs

In doing so, particular economic shocks are framed within the disasters literature for the first time. The institutional shift from corporate pensions to individual retirement accounts since the 1980’s changed the social and economic logics of retirement, making this financial location salient, where shocks to the stock market reveal a distinct pattern of economic action. Using the 401(k) retirement account data, I show that bear market years in 2002 and 2008 caused retirement savers to orient their portfolios toward durable conservatism – a finding that deviates from predictions made by either neoclassical or behavioral economic theory. Rather, a sociological mechanism developed in the disasters literature – the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) – provides a plausible explanation for the empirical findings. Interestingly, the practical rule of conservation that works well for many disaster scenarios, for retirement savers creates an unfortunate discrepancy between the objective chances of retirement security and the subjective aspirations of 401(k) savers by causing underinvestment in stocks that can produce suboptimal portfolio returns manifesting itself as latent retirement inequality, especially impacting the youngest savers who have the most at stake.",TRUE,FALSE,disasters|economic sociology|retirement|risk|social amplification of risk,2018-07-02T11:53:22.346077,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-20T03:30:43.827231,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Adam Hayes,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/citation/,fxgms,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kpcfd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/relationships/node/,kpcfd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b004102a556d0001405ca25/,5b004102a556d0001405ca25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxgms/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxgms/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxgms
