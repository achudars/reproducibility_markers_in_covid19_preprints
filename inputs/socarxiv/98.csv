cybertechnologies and Artificial Intelligence. However, there are increasing concerns over the privacy invasions and human rights violations associated with the exploitation of
personal data.
Various data laws were made in nations to balance the data fluidity and privacy protections. However, most laws have inherent limitations and underenforcement issues
that fail to achieve their aims and protection principles. Utilizing a behavioral economics theoretical framework, this study categorizes the issues and causes to Information
Asymmetry, Bounded Rationality, Power Imbalance, and Technical Incapacity.
The study makes a novel contribution by proposing a global data governance scheme to address the limitations of data laws. The scheme adopts a Libertarian Paternalism approach and develops seven principles in the framework design. Elements and components in the scheme include individuals, data controllers, privacy rating frameworks, meta-data and privacy configuration, reports, Automated Consent Management (ACM), Bureaus, and signatures, etc. The components will operate on an interoperable and global data management platform. Visual diagrams are developed to describe the various forms of interactions between components and procedures.
A balance between privacy protection and data fluidity is found through experimental scenarios such as Ordinary Data Request, Sensitive Data Request, Inconsistency Checks, Data Rights Exercise, Monitored Data Transfer, Broadcast and Notice. The scenarios analyzed are not exhaustive but serve as the meaningful starting
point to inspire more designs and discussions from scholars.",TRUE,FALSE,architecture|behavioral economics|big data|data protection|interoperability,2021-01-27T19:26:03.227484,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-27T19:25:47.419057,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4f|Law|Law and Economics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c79|Law|Consumer Protection Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",Bohan Hou,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/citation/,2b9dc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60102042c5784b0103d0a796/,60102042c5784b0103d0a796,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2b9dc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2b9dc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2b9dc,NA

A growing number of studies highlights the power of digital platforms to re-organize markets and thereby create new forms of dependence. But there are also indications that organizations are capable of countering platform power especially by demanding their regulation. This paper expands this view to investigate also strategies at the organizational level. It draws on resource dependence theory and studies of strategic responses to environmental changes to study how organizations strategically respond to the rise of digital platforms. To show organizations’ capacities to cope with the new digital market organization, we use a qualitative case study of the Swiss hotel sector and its reactions to so-called online travel agencies, based on interviews with hotel managers and professional representatives. We distinguish between three types of hotels –  small family-run, luxury, and chain hotels, and identify three types of strategic responses: bypassing, optimizing, and mitigating. Contrary to a platform power perspective, we find some evidence for organizations’ capacity to keep platforms at bay, by limiting dependence through mitigation, and platforms’ reach through bypassing. Hotels also learn to “play that algorithmic game” and take advantage of platforms’ technological affordances, but such strategies seem to accommodate platform power rather than countering it. Finally, we find that hotels with fewer resources (small family-run hotels) are less equipped to counter platform power, suggesting that platforms risk fostering existing hierarchies and segmentation in markets.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithm|Digital economy|hotel|platform capitalism|valuation,2021-01-27T19:26:42.018893,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-27T19:26:15.228326,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Philip Balsiger|Thomas Jammet|Nicola Cianferoni|Muriel Surdez,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/citation/,jv56d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60101d5475226b02eb516990/,60101d5475226b02eb516990,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jv56d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jv56d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jv56d,NA

We consider four different types of climate change frames: valence (positive vs. negative), theme (economic, environmental, health, and migration), scale (individual, community, country, and global), and timeframe (2050, 2030, now). The analysis also tests the effects of these different frames on individuals who are not concerned by the effects of climate change. Our results show a positive framing, in terms of the opportunities they provide, increases support for mitigation policies. We also find that an environmental and health framing of climate change increases public support for mitigation, while a migration framing reduces public support, and an economic framing has no effect. The results also show that framing climate change at a global level elicit greater public support for mitigation than at an individual level, and discussing the current impacts of climate change leads to greater support than future impacts.

Yet, little is known of the scale and severity of such PMIH-related policing demand, nor of the extent of frontline resource consumed in resolving such incidents. To address this shortfall, we deploy a bespoke text mining algorithm on police incident logs to estimate the proportion and severity of calls-for-service involving PMIH in a study of Greater Manchester, United Kingdom.  Further, and using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, we then assess the amount of time spent by frontline officers responding to these calls. Findings suggest that existing police recording practices serve to significantly underestimate the scale  and severity of PMIH-related demand.

We show that the concept translates well to the regional setting and to local and traded industries. Large cities and the Northeast have the highest complexity, while most traded industries are more complex than most local ones. In cross-section, metropolitan complexity is associated with higher incomes, though to a lesser extent recently than in the past. However, within-city increases in complexity are associated with income decreases.

We demonstrate the utility of our framework using 3-months of tweets across 42 police force areas (PFAs) of England and Wales (UK). The results reveal that public opinions on policing is overwhelmingly negative across space and time, and that these opinions have been most exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in three specific PFAs, namely Staffordshire, Thames Valley, and North Wales.

The present study aimed to investigate these issues with reference to current literature on intercultural course and materials de-velopment as well as instructional design and affordance theories. In particular, it explored the potential development of an intercultural training course consisting of teaching materials that employ three types of teaching techniques, namely the cultural awareness technique (CAT), critical incident technique (CIT) and cultural misunderstanding tech-nique (CMT). The result was a comprehensive course that included at-tainable goals, realistic learning objectives, conducive learning experi-ences, along with clear assessment criteria, scales, descriptors, methods, and tools for gauging the attainment of achievable learning outcomes.

This research/practice divide is particularly problematic for practitioners required to work within evidence-based or research-informed frameworks. To explore this issue, we conducted a nationwide survey and qualitative interviews with social work faculty regarding their research dissemination attitudes and practices, especially to non-academic audiences. The survey and interviews provide data on faculty dissemination methods; gold and green open access; and promotion and tenure considerations. Results demonstrate that faculty are primarily engaged with traditional dissemination methods, and much less engaged with dissemination to non-academic audiences. Faculty are skeptical of open access journals, avoid article processing charges, and are only minimally engaged with institutional repositories. Faculty are conflicted regarding the dissemination of applied research, especially in the context of promotion and tenure. Shifting dissemination to the field would require increased confidence in open access, support for the creation of practitioner focused materials, and reprioritizing impact of research in the field.",TRUE,FALSE,impact metrics|professional practice|research dissemination|social work,2021-01-26T05:46:03.989355,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-26T05:45:36.670810,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/citation/,23vy4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600f36dcc5784b0064d037e9/,600f36dcc5784b0064d037e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/23vy4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/23vy4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/23vy4,NA

Will the disruption caused by experiencing an environmental disaster be enough to motivate residents to change their values and behaviors?  This study answers that question by analyzing qualitative interview data collected from 40 residents of Calgary, Alberta, who survived the devastating and costly 2013 Southern Alberta Flood. Despite normally high levels of climate change denial and complacency, findings indicate that the flood prompted residents to concern themselves more with climate change and the climate crisis, and to begin adopting many household-level pro-environmental behaviors. The findings also point to important gender differences in both environmental concern and pro-environmental behaviors. Thus, the article establishes a social-psychological process of attitudinal and behavioral change, allowing us to better understand how jarring environmental events rupture complacency.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|complacency|disaster|environmental concern|oil and gas|pro-environmental behavior,2021-01-25T18:15:02.934252,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-25T18:14:05.149897,FALSE,NA,no,Qualitative interview data not public,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/citation/,kzm5u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600f03e6c5784b001dd0ad90/,600f03e6c5784b001dd0ad90,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzm5u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kzm5u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kzm5u,https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023121992934

For this reason, Sociologists avoid reading the Bible as a textual research source. Overcoming sociological resistance, however, and examining the Christian New Testament reveals a story much different than most sociologists might expect. While the Church may certainly be conservative, regressive, authoritarian, even predatorial, Jesus Christ and his apostles were not. Narrative analysis of Christian gospels reveals not a gentle shepherd of sheeple or a reactionary faith-based leader, but a revolutionary Christ that is neither conservative, gentle, nor passive—an impassioned and committed revolutionary set on progressive social change and fundamental revision of elite power structures.",TRUE,FALSE,Christian Church|Christianity|Contested Spirituality|Ideology|Jesus Christ|Sociology of Religion|Spirituality,2021-01-25T17:52:43.337616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-25T17:52:09.212251,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,Mike Sosteric,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/citation/,vf864,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600eeaa475226b01f9514fb3/,600eeaa475226b01f9514fb3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf864/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vf864/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vf864,NA
