We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for one month that exposed them to messages produced by elected officials, organizations, and other opinion leaders with opposing political ideologies. Respondents were re-surveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative post-treatment, and Democrats who followed a conservative Twitter bot became slightly more liberal post-treatment.

Changing shareholding pattern in companies established prior to liberalization and the impact.
Prior to 1991, the Indian economy was averse to policies that diluted the government’s control over the companies established in the country. A closed economy of sorts, the Indian economy perceptibly faced the pressure of global forces as well as internal turbulence's resulting in negative
economic indicators. As a result of the same, the government yielded to the situation and began the process of liberalization. The 1980s saw the advent of these policies through the delicensing of certain key industries which was then followed by the introduction of the New Economic Policy
which laid down the framework of liberalization as a formal reform in the economy in 1991.
Clusters of business groups in India formed around ethnic, religious and social communities, for example, the Marwaris of Rajasthan formed businesses in Bengal and elsewhere; the Gujaratis in the West, the Chettiars in the South, etc. There is a vast diversity in the Indian economy,
comprising of listed as well as unlisted, regional as well as foreign, private as well as public companies. The indigenous entrepreneurs in the Indian markets have now become veterans in their respective industries. Over the years, from government monopolies to family owned business
structures to the emergence of corporations’, the shareholding patterns in the Indian industrial fora have transitioned through various stages.
This research study tracks the movements in the shareholding patterns of Indian Companies spanning over a period from the 1980s up to 2015 to examine the impact of liberalization as an economic policy. The key objectives of this study are:
1. To describe the evolution of India’s listed companies’ shareholding structure.
2. To study the evolution of India’s industrial structure at the firm level as a result of
the reforms.
3. To analyze the industrial composition by ownership before and after reforms.
This study offers a captivating kaleidoscope of shareholding trends across the companies in the different industries over the years. This study is organized as follows:
Section 1: Overview of evolution in Company incorporations in India pre and post
liberalization.
Section 2: Description of trends in Industrial Structure in Non-Government Companies’
incorporations and the corresponding sectorial contributions to the GDP.
Section 3: Study of various ownership patterns in Indian Companies and the trends therein.
Section 4: Analysis of shareholding structures in listed companies (SENSEX.)
Section 5: Study of impact of foreign investments in the Indian Corporate Sector.
Section 6: Brief comparison of the shareholding patterns of business organizations as well as liberalization policies among the BRIC nations.

For instance, the attribution of positive feelings and cognitions to a stimulus leads to a positive judgment of that stimulus. We examined whether misattribution is moderated by the applicability of a distractor to the judgment question. For instance, when are people more likely to attribute to a target person the affective and cognitive experiences triggered by a kitten—when trying to judge the person's cuteness or trustworthiness? The kitten triggers experiences specifically relevant to cuteness, but people might more easily suspect the kitten's potential influence when judging cuteness rather than trustworthiness. Using the Affect Misattribution Procedure, we found that applicability increases the effect of misattribution on valenced judgments. The results emphasize the importance of specific information (rather than only general valence) in attribution and suggest that high applicability of distractors to the judgment question does not elicit effective correction.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:45:23.540015,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-21T16:21:46.542386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/citation/,ugm49,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qwbzn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/relationships/node/,qwbzn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab1edf980f2d3000e5b7fcc/,5ab1edf980f2d3000e5b7fcc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ugm49/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ugm49/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ugm49,NA

Our land use model, UrbanSim, is an open-source microsimulation platform used by metropolitan planning organizations worldwide for modeling the growth and development of cities over long (~30 year) time horizons. UrbanSim is particularly powerful as a scenario analysis tool, enabling planners to compare and contrast the impacts of different policy decisions on long term land use forecasts in a statistically rigorous way. Our travel demand model, ActivitySim, is an agent-based modeling platform that produces synthetic origin--destination travel demand data. Finally, we use a static user equilibrium traffic assignment model based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to assign vehicles to specific network paths to make trips between origins and destinations. This traffic assignment model runs in a high-performance computing environment. The resulting congested travel time data can then be fed back into UrbanSim and ActivitySim for the next model run.

Today, proponents of randomized control trials (so-called randomistas) are among the most influential of development experts. This article examines the growth of this thought collective, analysing how uncertainty has become a central concern of development institutions. It demonstrates that transformations within the aid industry – including the influence of evidence-based policy, the economization of development, and the retreat from macro-planning – created the conditions of possibility for experimentation. Within this field, the randomistas adeptly pursued a variety of rhetorical, affective, methodological, and organizational strategies that emphasized the lack of credible knowledge within aid and the ability of experiments to rectify the situation. Importantly, they have insisted on the moral worth of experimentation; indeed, the experimental ethic has been proposed as the way to change the spirit of development. Through causal certitude, they propose to reduce human suffering. The rise of experimentation has not, however, eliminated accusations of uncertainty; rather, it has redistributed the means through which knowledge about development is considered credible.",TRUE,FALSE,aid|development|evidence|experimentation|uncertainty,2018-07-02T11:45:22.966549,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T20:15:11.412618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/citation/,xygzb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m45yu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/relationships/node/,m45yu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab1588c80f2d300105b5854/,5ab1588c80f2d300105b5854,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xygzb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xygzb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xygzb,https://doi.org/10.1080/03085147.2018.1432153

As an empirical example, we study the global climate change debate in the media, by comparing frames used by NGO's, governments and experts in India and the USA. Our model identifies 12 framings of climate change, used in varied proportions by the different actors in the two countries.

Schooling has been made compulsory for all children under fourteen. The government spending on education is being raised to six per cent of the GDP. Incentives are being given to schools with best student and teacher attendance. The Government sponsored Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Universal Elementary Education), focuses on increasing enrolment rates and reducing drop-out rates. The reasons for dropout in the primary education system have been persistently disturbing not only in an emerging economy like India but also in other developing countries. Dropout by children does not mean mere refusal of attending school. It leads to wastage of the funds invested in school buildings, teachers’ salaries, equipment, textbooks and so on.

Coastal tourism and recreation are important parts of the largest and most rapidly growing activity in the world--- international tourism. Tourism and recreation-related development is one of the major factors shaping development patterns in the coastal zones of India. Hence, any analysis of India’s interests in coasts and oceans must take account of its interrelated activities. Government at all levels must assume appropriate proactive roles to shape and guide coastal tourism development. This paper reviews the importance of coastal tourism and recreation to India and its citizens and identifies gaps where action is needed.",TRUE,FALSE,coastal development|Coastal tourism|recreation|recreation-related development|tourist sites,2018-07-02T11:45:22.692702,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T20:13:14.004668,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/citation/,396aw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/83v56/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/relationships/node/,83v56,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab11565fb9476000c29532e/,5ab11565fb9476000c29532e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/396aw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/396aw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/396aw,NA

Instead of assuming members of parliaments' (MPs) intrinsic motivations to be underlying immigrants' substantive representation, we highlight extrinsic motives. Drawing on principal-agent theory, we conceptualise MPs as delegates who follow the instructions of their main principals, constituents and party bodies. On this basis, we study the link between institutional variables and substantive representation. Based on an analysis of more than 20,000 parliamentary questions for written answer tabled in the 17th German Bundestag (2009-13), we find that immigrants' substantive representation hinges strongly on the demands of MPs' principals. However, our empirical analysis suggests that electoral rules do not influence the relationships between MPs and their principals, while candidate selection methods as well as powerful parliamentary party group leaderships do.",TRUE,FALSE,Bundestag|Germany|Immigrant-origin citizens|Parliamentary institutions|Parliamentary questions|Substantive representation,2018-07-02T11:45:22.514469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T12:53:23.512648,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/citation/,xu3gh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ver2z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/relationships/node/,ver2z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab1021d80f2d3000d5b7a4a/,5ab1021d80f2d3000d5b7a4a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xu3gh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xu3gh,NA
