This paper examines police-public encounters that resulted in the fatal shooting of civilians during 2015 and 2016. Data published by The Washington Post is merged with data collected by the author regarding how encounters were initiated. Descriptive analysis and basic statistical analysis is performed and the results indicate that how police contact was initiated varies by race/ethnicity, age, sex, mental health status, and whether (or how) the individual killed by police was armed with a weapon. The implications of the results for understanding police use of force are discussed. This paper recommends that databases on civilian fatalities include information on how contact was initiated. Without this crucial information, understandings of police use of force are incomplete.",TRUE,FALSE,Mental Health|Police|Race/ethnicity,2018-07-02T10:51:06.444555,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-14T00:59:45.130000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/citation/,jsg5h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7z2rb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/relationships/node/,7z2rb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a255806c613b01f0990b7b/,58a255806c613b01f0990b7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jsg5h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jsg5h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jsg5h,NA

The use of this tobacco snuff—referred to in Tzotzil Maya as “angel” (anjel), “elder brother” (bankilal), “great old man” (muk’ta mol), or simply “tobacco” (moy)—appears to date back to the Classic Maya, and represents continuity in Mayan tobacco culture spanning more than a thousand years. Despite the central importance of this plant in highland Maya medicine and ritual, its use has not previously been documented in any systematic manner. Accordingly, this chapter seeks to present a comprehensive overview of traditional highland Maya tobacco culture among the contemporary Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya of highland Chiapas, exploring the cultural significance in this quintessentially Amerindian plant in the domains of ethnomedicine, ritual, folklore, and mythology.",TRUE,FALSE,Ancient Maya|ethnobotany|ethnomedicine|Highland Maya|Maya|Nicotiana|oral snuff|tobacco|Tzeltal|Tzotzil,2018-07-02T10:49:04.186541,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-13T18:33:36.747000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/citation/,eh2yp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yvxj7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/relationships/node/,yvxj7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a1fb499ad5a101f53cd93e/,58a1fb499ad5a101f53cd93e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh2yp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eh2yp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eh2yp,NA

Smart city technologies are promoted as an effective way to counter and manage uncertainty and urban risks through the effective and efficient delivery of services, yet paradoxically they create new vulnerabilities and threats, including making city infrastructure and services insecure, brittle, and open to extended forms of criminal activity. This paradox has largely been ignored or underestimated by commercial and governmental interests or tackled through a technically-mediated mitigation approach. We identify five forms of vulnerabilities with respect to smart city technologies, detail the present extent of cyberattacks on networked infrastructure and services, and present a number of illustrative examples. We then adopt a normative approach to explore existing mitigation strategies, suggesting a wider set of systemic interventions (including security-by-design, remedial security patching and replacement, formation of core security and computer emergency response teams, a change in procurement procedures, and continuing professional development).

What is unique about this technology is its use by women who are not currently infertile but who may anticipate a future diagnosis. This circumstance gives rise to a new ontological category of “anticipated infertility.” The author draws on participant observation and a qualitative analysis of scientific, mainstream, and marketing literature to identify and compare the representation of two different candidates for egg freezing: women with cancer and healthy young women. Although both populations experience anticipated infertility, their dichotomous portrayals as appropriate candidates are demonstrative of gender norms linking women to motherhood.

Such an invitation seeks to provide psychology with a non-reductionist and processual understanding of experience. Moreover, it encourages efforts to deploy the specific patterns of processes of heterogeneous relations that compose specific and perceivable forms of individuation. It is tempting to celebrate this new way of understanding the possibilities of psychology since it avoids what can be understood as the 'illusion of subjectivity' (Duff, 2014), i.e. it's evanescent and mediated character. Under that scope, subjectivity is an illusion psychology frequently grounds in an equally illusory reified, single-bounded, autonomous subject. What this paper seeks to propose is that along with embracing the idea of psychology as the task of experimenting with individuals as problems -and the new forms of subjectivity that might entail- we would do well by asking what kind of problems individuals are, and what does it mean to cultivate 'individuals as problems' as the raison d'etre of its work, and wonder about what 'the psychological' might become under such endeavour.",TRUE,FALSE,critical psychology|critical social psychology|experience|process philosophy|science and technology studies|subjectivity|William James,2018-07-02T10:53:42.805286,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-12T19:33:41.145000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/citation/,ujzw4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mzycc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/relationships/node/,mzycc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58a0b7836c613b01fcb35274/,58a0b7836c613b01fcb35274,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ujzw4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ujzw4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ujzw4,NA

Detailed examination shows a threshold effect: the minimum Black imprisonment rate was uncorrelated with percent Black, but very high Black imprisonment rates occurred only where the percent Black was relatively low. This is not explained by the statistical instability of small populations: although there is more instability where the percent Black is low, the pattern holds up for places with large Black populations. It is also not explained by urbanity as the pattern replicates for metropolitan areas. In addition, the assumption that imprisonment is basically an urban phenomenon is wrong: Whites have higher imprisonment rates in rural areas, and the urban-rural difference for Blacks declined to a low level by the end of the study period. Other minorities are briefly discussed, showing that each has a distinctive pattern. Overall the data refute simplistic theories of group threat and support social control theories that consider both the capacity and desire for social control.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:48:30.479976,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-11T17:36:45.565000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/citation/,cypme,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7uegn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/relationships/node/,7uegn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/589f4b329ad5a10200716382/,589f4b329ad5a10200716382,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cypme/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cypme/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cypme,NA

Overall, the national Black prison admission rate leveled off after 1995 while the White rate continued to rise. Detailed investigation of types of places reveals that the national trend for Blacks hides a steep decline in Black prison admissions in a few large metropolitan areas coupled with a continued rise in other places, especially those where Blacks were a smaller percentage of the population. White prison admission rates were consistently low and relatively stable in the large metropolitan areas. The growth in White prison admission was concentrated in rural areas and smaller cities that were overwhelmingly White.
