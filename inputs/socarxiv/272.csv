For decades, redlining limited access to homeownership and wealth creation among racial minorities, contributing to a host of adverse social outcomes, including high unemployment, poverty, and residential vacancy, that persist today. While the multigenerational socioeconomic impacts of redlining are increasingly understood, the impacts on urban environments and ecosystems remains unclear. To begin to address this gap, we investigated how the HOLC policy administered 80 years ago may relate to present-day tree canopy at the neighborhood level. Urban trees provide many ecosystem services, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and may improve quality of life in cities. In our prior research in Baltimore, MD, we discovered that redlining policy influenced the location and allocation of trees and parks. Our analysis of 37 metropolitan areas here shows that areas formerly graded D, which were mostly inhabited by racial and ethnic minorities, have on average ~23% tree canopy cover today. Areas formerly graded A, characterized by U.S.-born white populations living in newer housing stock, had nearly twice as much tree canopy (~43%). Results are consistent across small and large metropolitan regions. The ranking system used by Home Owners’ Loan Corporation to assess loan risk in the 1930s parallels the rank order of average percent tree canopy cover today.",TRUE,FALSE,Environmental Justice|Mortgage loans|Urban Tree Canopy,2020-01-06T04:14:27.445122,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-06T04:14:06.499158,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/citation/,97zcs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e110623573419011f80516f/,5e110623573419011f80516f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97zcs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/97zcs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/97zcs,NA

This makes the expected moral value of space colonization immense. However, colonizing space also creates risks --- risks whose potential harm could easily overshadow all the benefits of humankind's long-term future. In this article, I present a preliminary overview of some major risks of space colonization: Prioritization risks, aberration risks, and conflict risks. Each of these risk types contains risks that can create enormous disvalue; in some cases orders of magnitude more disvalue than all the potential positive value humankind could have. From a (weakly) negative, suffering-focused utilitarian view, we therefore have the obligation to mitigate space colonization-related risks and make space colonization as safe as possible. In order to do so, we need to start working on real-world space colonization governance. Given the near total lack of progress in the domain of space governance in recent decades, however, it is uncertain whether meaningful space colonization governance can be established in the near future, and before it is too late.",TRUE,FALSE,existential risk|risk|space colonization,2020-01-04T18:14:01.424129,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-04T18:13:45.138201,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/citation/,hj4f2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e10499e7545840100f9a0f7/,5e10499e7545840100f9a0f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hj4f2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hj4f2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hj4f2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2020.102638

The movement is predominantly located in working class communities of color and has fought for decades to turn vacant land into beneficial community spaces. However, many of these communities are struggling with gentrification, which has the potential to transform access to and use of community gardens in the city and the politics around them. Drawing on separate multi-year ethnographic projects, this article compares two community gardens in food insecure communities in Queens and Brooklyn: one that is undergoing gentrification and one that is not. We analyze how race and class transformations in each community shape the trajectories of urban agriculture spaces, specifically the ideologies, agricultural practices, and daily interactions among gardeners and as well as between gardeners and nongardeners. We find significant differences in how the two sets of community gardeners conceptualize the purpose of their gardens, particularly in constructing them as green spaces, agricultural production sites, and tools for achieving food justice. We argue that these differences can be best understood at the intersection of the personal histories of individuals, the organizational settings in which the gardens are embedded, and each neighborhood’s history of urban renewal and gentrification. Our findings show why some community gardens in food insecure communities adopt a food justice vision, while others do not, and how gentrification can amplify racial and class tensions within community gardens and between gardeners and nongardeners.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|community gardens|ethnography|food justice|gentrification|New York City|race|urban sociology,2020-01-03T19:18:22.315179,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-03T19:18:13.033801,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/citation/,kw9zd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0f4c5357341900cf803eaa/,5e0f4c5357341900cf803eaa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw9zd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw9zd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw9zd,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-019-10011-w

Boardgames also have immense potential as naturalistic laboratories for studying psychological phenomena, providing players opportunities for small-group and interpersonal interactions with social, emotional, and cognitive consequences. Although different boardgaming motivations likely modulate these processes and outcomes, no grounded, validated instrument exists to measure them. This three-study investigation explored gaming motivations of and gratifications enjoyed by boardgamers (Study 1) and drew from this exploration to develop the Boardgaming Motivations Scale (Study 2; N = 1,045). Exploratory structural equation models provided initial evidence of the scale’s validity (Study 2). The scale was further refined, confirmed, and validated with an independent sample of less involved boardgamers (Study 3; N = 652). The diverse pool of motivations for playing boardgames inductively identified in Study 1 were reduced to seven dimensions in Study 2 and finally to six in Study 3. These dimensions reflected lusory, immersion, group sociality, community, escapism, and mastery boardgaming motivations. Relationships among these motivations and preferences for boardgame mechanics and genres, individual differences, and videogaming motivations provided initial evidence of the construct, convergent, predictive, and discriminant validity of the Boardgaming Motivations Scale.

Students using the commercial and open textbook demonstrated equivalent final grades and test scores. The open resource was more likely to be used on a weekly basis by students and was described as straightforward and easy to access. Among students who extensively used the open textbook, it was associated with improved attitudes towards research methods. The impact of open textbooks on student use, perceptions, and access varied by hybrid and in-person course format.

(2018: 302) that “police killings of unarmed black Americans have effects on mental health among black American adults in the general population.” The Mapping Police Violence data used by the authors includes 91 incidents involving black decedents who were either (1) not killed by police officers in the line of duty or (2) armed when killed. These incidents should have been removed or recoded prior to analysis. Correctly recoding these incidents decreased in magnitude all of the reported coefficients, and, more importantly, eliminated the reported statistically significant effect of exposure to police killings of unarmed black individuals on the mental health of black Americans in the general population.
