The national dialogue on policing, which gained momentum following the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, coincided with a decline in arrests in Baltimore, especially on minor charges.  No changes in crime levels resulted from these declines in arrests.  After a week of unrest in Baltimore in 2015, following the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody, arrests of all types declined abruptly while crimes of all types soared during a three-month period.  Following the completion of a federal investigation in 2016, the city signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 2017 and agreed to reform the police department under a court monitor.  As of 2020, violent crime remains high, but arrests have declined in a pattern that is consistent with calls for reform.  The fourth post-Gray police commissioner, who was appointed in February 2019, introduced a crime plan that appears to have reduced robberies and property crime without increasing arrests.  Homicides and shootings remain far too high, on an absolute scale and relative to the baseline period from 2010 to 2014.",TRUE,FALSE,Arrest rates|Baltimore|Consent decree|Crime rates|Ferguson effect|Police,2020-05-15T00:01:00.816523,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-14T23:59:07.741123,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/citation/,fcm7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7t8ga/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/relationships/node/,7t8ga,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebd56ba9f896200d14d5a5b/,5ebd56ba9f896200d14d5a5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcm7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fcm7t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fcm7t,NA

Scholarly literature has mainly focused on fee-based tutoring in academic subjects supplied by individual tutors or tutoring companies outside schools. In the Czech Republic, a specific form of shadow education is offered by mainstream schools that provide compulsory education. The focus of this paper is on paid preparatory courses offered by academic-track schools to prepare pupils for entrance examinations to their study programs. It explores principals’ motivations to provide such courses, and associated issues and dilemmas. Its findings are based on a mixed-method research design, and draw mainly from qualitative interviews with principals and other management staff. Findings suggest that in the context of high school autonomy and per-capita school funding, principals perceive this kind of shadow education as a tool to marketize the school and attract more (high-achieving) pupils. Principals sometimes conduct tough negotiations with their schoolteachers about their involvement in the practice, and school shadow education may raise ethical and equity-related issues.

Part of the neglect stems from conflating the livestock owning unit, i.e. the household, with the herding group. Among Tibetan pastoralists the herding group consist of people and animals from one or several households. They herd in groups because there is an optimal size of the herd with respect to daily herding: too few animals and the animals disperse while too many negatively affect grazing efficiency and subsequently livestock survival during winter. Individual household also free up members for e.g. selling or trading livestock products. Furthermore, group formation makes it possible to split herds into smaller sub-herds that consider differing needs for varying livestock species and age-categories. While herding groups can change both seasonally and annually, they are a fundamental unit for pastoral social organisation because they are concerned with daily cooperation.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|herding|labour|nomadic pastoralism|privatisation,2020-05-14T23:56:40.588940,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-14T23:55:16.459283,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/citation/,45vzg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebd127b9f896200b64d7bfd/,5ebd127b9f896200b64d7bfd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/45vzg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/45vzg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/45vzg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.104407

Karl Brohier, a Nobel Prize winner, who is a dramatic persona in the novel, elaborates a new theory, re-reading and re-writing Pauling’s “The Nature of the Chemical Bond”; according to Brohier: “Information organizes and differentiates energy. It regularizes and stabilizes matter. Information propagates through matter-energy and mediates the interactions of matter-energy.” Dr Horton, his collaborator in the novel replies: “If the universe consists of energy and information, then the Trigger somehow alters the information envelope of certain substances –“.
“Alters it, scrambles it, overwhelms it, destabilizes it” Brohier adds.
There is a scientific debate whether or how far chemistry is fundamentally reducible to quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, the fact that many essential chemical properties and reactions are at least partly representable in terms of quantum mechanics is doubtless. For the quantum mechanics itself has been reformulated as a theory of a special kind of information, quantum information, chemistry might be in turn interpreted in the same terms.
Wave function, the fundamental concept of quantum mechanics, can be equivalently defined as a series of qubits, eventually infinite. A qubit, being defined as the normed superposition of the two orthogonal subspaces of the complex Hilbert space, can be interpreted as a generalization of the standard bit of information as to infinite sets or series. All “forces” in the Standard model, which are furthermore essential for chemical transformations, are groups [U(1),SU(2),SU(3)] of the transformations of the complex Hilbert space and thus, of series of qubits.
One can suggest that any chemical substances and changes are fundamentally representable as quantum information and its transformations. If entanglement is interpreted as a physical field, though any group above seems to be unattachable to it, it might be identified as the “Triger field”. It might cause a direct transformation of any chemical substance by from a remote distance.

In this study, we discuss factors that potentially contribute to and result from online privacy literacy. In an online questionnaire with 630 Facebook users, we found that people who spend more time on Facebook and who have changed their privacy settings more frequently reported to have more online privacy literacy. People with more online privacy literacy, in turn, felt more secure on Facebook and implemented more social privacy settings. A mediation analysis showed that time spend on Facebook and experience with privacy regulation did not per se increase safety and privacy behavior directly, stressing the importance of online privacy literacy as a mediator to a safe and privacy-enhancing online behavior.

Implementing a series of difference-in-differences designs, I find that changing a voter’s polling place location causes a 1 to 2 percentage point decline in general election turnout likelihood. The majority of the turnout decline can be attributed to the search costs associated with finding one’s new polling place location rather than the distance costs of traveling to the polling place on Election Day.

Evidence from State Earned Income Tax Credits,"Whether and how individuals link benefits they receive from the government to their voting behavior is a central question in political economy. We study this question using one of the largest social provision programs in the United States: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). We exploit the staggered roll-out of state-level EITC programs to estimate the causal effect of the program on elections, voter behavior, and attitudes about the government. Contrary to predictions from the policy feedback literature, we show that the credit leads to higher vote shares and approval ratings for the implementing governor.

Appropriate network data for this task is increasingly available. The inherent dependencies in relational data, however, pose unique challenges. This is especially true for those involved in the ascendant tasks of cross-network comparisons or multilevel network analysis. The author draws on item response theory and multilevel (mixed effects) modeling to propose a methodological approach that accounts for these dependencies and allows the analyst to model variation of latent dyadic traits across relations, actors, and groups precisely and parsimoniously. Examples demonstrate the approach’s utility for three important research areas: tie strength in adolescent friendships, group differences in how discussing personal problems relates to tie strength, and the analysis of multiple relations.",TRUE,FALSE,dyadic data|item response theory|mixed effects models|multilevel models|social networks,2020-05-17T05:04:05.262468,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-17T05:03:37.625645,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/citation/,sx9um,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/32pey/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/relationships/node/,32pey,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebc47359f896200844d84bf/,5ebc47359f896200844d84bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx9um/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sx9um/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sx9um,NA

Our paper shows that these estimates, by failing to take into account the effect of regional differences in the distribution of skin tones, tend to overestimate the gap between light and dark skin tones in Mexico. In other words, they overestimate the intergenerational rate of rank persistence for the dark skin population by omitting the effect of differences in regional economic performance. We correct for this factor by analyzing a new data set with information representative at the regional level. Our results suggest that the mobility gap between light and dark skin tone individuals persists after including the regional dimension in the analysis. Throughout the country, light skin individuals have an advantage at moving upwards the socioeconomic scale and remaining at the top compared with the rest of the population. However, the magnitude of the gap varies across regions, being smallest in Mexico City and largest in the North West and South regions of the country. We also find that, regardless of skin tone, individuals with origins in the South face a disadvantage with respect to their peers from the rest of the country.
