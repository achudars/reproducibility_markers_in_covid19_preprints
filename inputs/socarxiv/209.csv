However, the name “atom” in physics is reserved for entities, which can be divided into electrons, protons, neutrons and other “elementary particles”, some of which are in turn compounded by other, “more elementary” ones. Instead of this, quantum mechanics is grounded on the actually indivisible quanta of action limited by the fundamental Planck constant. It resolves the problem of how both discrete and continuous (even smooth) to be described uniformly and invariantly in thus. Quantum mechanics can be interpreted in terms of quantum information. Qubit is the indivisible unit (“atom”) of quantum information. The imagery of atomism in modern physics moves from atoms of matter (or energy) via “atoms” (quanta) of action to “atoms” (qubits) of quantum information.

This paper leverages a prospective-longitudinal cohort study with data before and during the pandemic to examine this question.
Methods: Data came from an ongoing cohort study (n=737). Non-compliance with public health measures and concurrent correlates were measured at age 22. Antecedent sociodemographic, social, and psychological factors were measured at ages 15-20.
Findings: Young adults generally complied with COVID-19 public health measures, although compliance with some measures (e.g., cleaning/disinfecting mobile phones, standing 1.5-2 meters apart) was relatively lower. Non-compliance, especially with hygiene-related measures, was more prevalent in males, and in individuals with higher education, higher SES, and a non- migrant background. Non-compliance was associated with “antisocial potential,” including pre-pandemic low acceptance of moral rules, legal cynicism, low shame/guilt, low self-control, engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers. Young adults with low trust, including in the government’s measures for fighting the virus, also complied less.
Interpretation: In order to increase voluntary compliance with COVID-19 measures, public health campaigns should implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information. For young adults with low self-control, self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, or nudging may increase compliance.

Analyzing data from the 2014-2018 Current Population Survey (CPS) and using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplementary Poverty Measure, we describe differences in child poverty rates across immigrant generations (first-, second-, and third+-generation immigrant children) and how these are rooted in generational differences in the prevalence and impact of key poverty risk factors. We find that (1) poverty rates among Hispanic children are very high, particularly among first- and second- generation with two foreign-born parents children; (2) limited parental employment is by far the greatest risk factor for child poverty compared to having a young or poorly educated parent, living in a single-headed family or disadvantaged place of residence; (3) inter-generational differences in risk factor prevalence explain non-trivial shares of corresponding child poverty gaps; and (4) the patterns observed among the Hispanic population are moderated by race and ethnicity.

To investigate how COVID-19-related health and socio-economic vulnerabilities occur at the household level, and how they are distributed across household types and geographical areas in the United Kingdom. 
Design. Cross-sectional, nationally representative study. 
Setting.  The United Kingdom. 
Participants.  ~19,500 households. 
Main outcome measures. Using multiple household-level indicators and principal components analysis, we derive summary measures representing different dimensions of household vulnerabilities critical during the COVID-19 epidemic: health, employment, housing, financial and digital. 
Results. Our analysis highlights three key findings. First, although COVID-19 health risks are concentrated in retirement-age households, a substantial proportion of working age households also face these risks. Second, different types of households exhibit different vulnerabilities, with working-age households more likely to face financial, housing and employment precarities, and retirement-age households health and digital vulnerabilities. Third, there are area-level differences in the distribution of vulnerabilities across England and the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. 
Conclusions. The findings imply that the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to vary by household type. Policy measures that aim to mitigate the health and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider how vulnerabilities cluster together across different household types, and how these may exacerbate already existing inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Health inequalities|Household|Principal Components Analysis|Socio-economic inequalities|United Kingdom|Vulnerability,2020-05-04T15:04:21.229802,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-02T11:43:13.424044,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/citation/,4wtz8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eac3e9f69d3e10018de7d57/,5eac3e9f69d3e10018de7d57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4wtz8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4wtz8

The effect of endorsements on candidate choice,"Candidate endorsements are known to affect the likelihood that a voter will vote for a candidate since they reduce the efforts devoted to vote choices. However, the effects of endorsements from different sources remain under-explored. Furthermore, the effects of endorsements are believed to vary with the level of political sophistication, as voters with low sophistication are more reliant on such shortcuts, but it is unclear whether these differences are similar for different sources. We study the effects of endorsements from three different sources – family and close friends, networks on social media and Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) – on candidate favorability. We do so with a choice-based conjoint experiment embedded in a survey from Finland (n=1021), where we also examine differences in effects across political sophistication (political interest, frequency of political discussions, internal political efficacy, party identification, and voting in the last parliamentary election). The results show that endorsements from VAAs and family and friends have positive effects while social media networks do not. We do not find systematic differences in effects across levels of political sophistication no matter how we operationalize it.  This shows that it is important to consider the source of an endorsement to appreciate the effect, no matter who is the recipient.",TRUE,FALSE,Candidate choice|conjoint analysis|endorsements|political sophistication,2020-05-04T15:05:03.299868,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-02T11:45:12.082823,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/fg6u7/,available,NA,https://osf.io/k5gvn,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/citation/,zhfwy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rdxct/,rdxct,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eac29abe4f08102f9075549/,5eac29abe4f08102f9075549,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zhfwy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zhfwy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zhfwy

The paper introduces a scale constructed to test the Attitude towards water conservation in India. It contains various sub-scales that include a General Attitude towards water conservation, Past behavior/experience, Moral obligation to save water resources, Perceived water right, and Behavioural intention of conserving water resources. 432 participants participated in a nationwide survey and their responses were checked for reliability. Results reveal that people generally have a positive attitude towards water conservation and that there is substantial potential of the resources’ conservation. The scale can be used to measure attitude changes and thereby the effectiveness of an implemented plan of action concerning water conservation.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes|Attitude Scale|Moral Obligation to save water|Perceived water right|Water Conservation,2020-05-04T15:04:54.484616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-02T11:44:23.390631,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/citation/,wst9d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eac1fe2e4f08102f2075bca/,5eac1fe2e4f08102f2075bca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wst9d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wst9d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wst9d

In this paper, we make three contributions to enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these disparities: First, we investigate which processes drive social disparities in competences by parents’ financial resources among pre-schoolers in Germany. We consider the family investment model, the family stress model, neighborhood effects, childcare arrangements, and educational norms. Second, we evaluate whether there are differences by parental net worth, too, and whether these are mediated by the same factors as parental income. Third, we extend the existing literature by explicitly modeling the interrelations between the different mediators. We find substantial differences in children’s math, science, and PPVT test scores by both, parental income and net worth. These differences mostly occur at the lower end of the respective distributions. The indirect effects through all mediators together account for around one-third of the differences by parental income, but at most one-sixth of differences by parental net worth. Parents’ investment is by far the most important mediator, followed by neighborhood effects. Family stress, pro-educational norms, and childcare arrangements play only a minor role. Furthermore, we find important interrelations between the mediators, especially for parents’ educational norms. Yet, these interrelations hardly affect the contribution of the different mediators.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-05-04T15:04:21.706176,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-02T11:45:46.043473,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/citation/,q7prw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eabfe47e4f08102e2077304/,5eabfe47e4f08102e2077304,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q7prw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q7prw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q7prw
