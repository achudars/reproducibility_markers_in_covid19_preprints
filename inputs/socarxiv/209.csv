The facility bears no resemblance to other observatories. Inside a dome, the telescope sits on 42 ft tall concrete pier with wrap around staircase and concrete legs. Surrounding forest is similar in height to the dome, the design of which is counter intuitive. This study investigated why, at the risk of compromising performance, there was a departure from standard design, and to identify drivers for the decision making. Observatory visitors learn of a government architect, Tadeusz Andrzejaczek who made whimsical, successive increases to the height of the structure. Though designed in collaboration with Acting Government Astronomer, Bertrand Harris, it is improbable that a public servant architect would have such influence over a scientific installation. Vibration amelioration was met by designing massive strength and rigidity into the structure. Thermal expansion and wind stresses were reduced by features including shade fins and protective walls, and ground thermal disturbance was addressed by simply making it tall. Seeing measurements were not a significant design consideration. The facility exists with its current floor height because of successive approvals for modifications. The initial design was by Harris and requests for redesigns came from him but in close negotiation with Andrzejaczek who desired a structure of futuristic shape and proportions. Harris's designs were influenced by his personal English background and the Old Perth Observatory where he worked as an astronomer. Andrzejaczek’s design was influenced by an observatory in his birth city, his alignment with contemporary designers and his artistic flair.",TRUE,FALSE,History|Lowell|Mars|Observatory|Perth|Telescope,2020-08-12T21:10:48.962384,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-12T21:10:04.900935,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/citation/,x538u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f33d8520e1155002274f659/,5f33d8520e1155002274f659,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x538u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x538u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x538u,NA

Previous research on the motives of delegation finds that authority is more likely to be delegated to the executive when policy is complex. However, policy complexity is not directly observable and the search for a reasonable proxy constitutes a major challenge for scholars. This article presents a concise and measurable definition of policy complexity based on a policy's textual sophistication and its ties to other rules and regulations. Using crowdsourcing and a pairwise comparison framework it is shown that the proposed defining features are crucial for humans' understanding of policy text.

However, leisure is not impervious to cooptation by less benevolent social processes. In this conceptual analysis, I argue that incarcerated women’s leisure must be rethought as a component of its environment and by extension, as subjected to coercive and normative prison missions. After broadly delineating incarcerated women’s leisure, I determine that some characteristics of leisure can be compatible with these prison missions. I then examine individual, organizational, and social benefits and issues with leisure in women’s prisons. I link these practices to reduced coerciveness and increased normativity. I conclude by suggesting that ensuring incarcerated people’s wellbeing through leisure is not in itself an end, but a means to achieve prison’s coercive and normative ends.

Recent research has suggested that contextual income mobility (e.g., county-level socioeconomic mobility) may play an essential role in explaining the longevity gap.  Previous studies -- based mostly on aggregate and cross-sectional individual data -- show an association between county income mobility and county mortality and individual's health. However, inferring individual effects from aggregate (county-level) data can be problematic (i.e., ecological fallacy), and measuring exposure to income mobility using the county where respondents currently live or die, might overlook the selection process associated with residential mobility. This paper aims to extend previous research by estimating the effect of average exposure to mobility regimes during childhood and adolescence on adult health using longitudinal data and accounting for selection into counties over time (i.e., residential mobility). We use both the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with geocoded data to assess the link between county-level income mobility (Chetty's estimates), behaviors (smoking) and health conditions and status (self-reported health, BMI, depressive symptoms). Furthermore, we use cohorts optimally match Chetty's estimates of income mobility in the U.S. (1980-1982) and account for selection and time-varying confounders using marginal structural models (MSM). Overall, we provide a more precise test of the hypothesis that childhood exposure to income mobility regimes may determine health status through behavior (i.e., smoking) later in life and contribute to longevity gaps.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-11T11:00:50.329355,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T10:55:52.026659,FALSE,NA,no,The NSLY97 and PSID data are restricted.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/citation/,5fdzs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f32730e75d29f0106175dc5/,5f32730e75d29f0106175dc5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fdzs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5fdzs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5fdzs,NA

In the last few years, the (re) introduction of military conscription has been a focus of public debate, but empirical analysis of the issue remains limited. We argue that democratic nations with conscription-based military recruitment in place are less likely to initiate international conflicts than those with voluntary recruitment because public opinion will estimate a higher probability of direct involvement in disputes, causing political leaders to refrain from conflicts, even though stable military resources are in place. On the other hand, authoritarian nations with conscription-based recruitment systems are more likely to engage in conflicts than those with voluntary recruitment systems because political leaders are not accountable to the people, even though the cost of war is calculated in the same manner as that in democratic nations. To test this reasoning, we use directed-dyadic data from 1816 to 2005.

But these plans began to go into decline in the 1980s, when defined-contribution retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, came to replace them. This article makes three arguments about this rise and fall to contribute toward a theory of structural contingency. First, in both episodes, state intervention into labor-management relations triggered policy changes in the private pension system. Second, policy makers were motivated to intervene because of a structural condition—namely, to manage perceived crises in capitalism. And third, the particular way they intervened and how their policy choices spurred pension marketization were driven by contingent historical circumstances. This article argues that structural constraints that inhere in capitalist democracies established a range of possible policy options available to policy makers, yet contingent and historical factors channeled policy selection within that range.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-11T07:36:40.899589,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11T07:36:32.095450,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,The University of Chicago Press,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/citation/,2vdeq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f31b48547928800fb85b20d/,5f31b48547928800fb85b20d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2vdeq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2vdeq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2vdeq,NA
