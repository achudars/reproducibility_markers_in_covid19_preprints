Such a person will not discover the existence of "" the Word"" with which he commanded order to exist out of disorder which mankind enjoys today.  This ""Word"" is the power of God.  It is with this Word that he was able to bring order in the ""tohu wabohu"" he met (Gen. 1:2).  Let it be clear from the beginning that the phrase ""tohu wabohu"" has remained enigmatic and defies all translations.  It tries to explain the 'nothingness' of the situation before God began creating the universe.  It is through the ""Word"" that we were told that everything that exists came into being (John 1:3).  This same word became flesh (John 1:14) so as to bring back the strayed (Gen. 3:24) humanity back to their original root which is eternal communion with God.  The greatest problem is that humanity has not understood the meaning of that ""Word.""  The aim of this work is to show that God created the world through the Word and this Word  always appears for the good of mankind wherever it does.  To live in opposition to this Word is to create more problems for mankind and to live in communion with him is to understand the essence of the 'Word' and thus help in solving human problems.  This paper argues that if John 1:1-18 is properly understood, most misunderstandings as regards the creation of the world would be halted and appreciation of the 'Word' will increase in the world.  Significantly, this work will benefit all human beings that seek the good of mankind.

When seeking knowledge online on specific subject matter, one may encounter a wide assortment of material ranging from professional academic research to an everyman’s personal opinion – the spectrum of information available online is infinite (Hayat &amp; Hershkovitz, 2018). The emergence and popularization of social media and networking sites in particular have led to a change in digital dynamics, segueing from the norm of mass cultural consumption to that of mass production . Today, user generated content accounts for a generous portion of online resources, and has a notable affect on people’s thoughts and actions.
Changes in the electronic landscape have also revolutionized industries in addition to transforming cultural norms. The digitization of services and products has led to the decline of print publications, a drastic shift in consumer’s purchasing habits, and a metamorphosis in the music industry. With today’s song streaming services and free and readily available online audio content, the big business of record labels and album sales are antiquated and inaccurate representations of success in the market.
This work takes into account the heavy influence that the Internet has on the music industry, and aims to find a positive correlation between the volume of online discussion on a given song and the amount of Youtube views that song will have. In other words, to what extent does social media mentions predict the success of a song on Youtube? In Section 3 of this research we will detail existing work relating to this topic and discuss the changes of the Internet in the era of Web 2.0, as well as the importance of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and it’s impact on online consumer interactions.

God after creating them, he blessed them saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that move upon the earth” (Gen. 1:28). As mankind continued to live as was commanded, they turned inwards to subdue and dominate one another.  Man against woman; village against village, town against town; state against state; region against region and worst of all tribe against tribe. This domination can come in the form of “stronger persons” dominating the “weaker ones,” “the stronger families” dominating “weaker families,” or “the stronger tribes” dominating “weaker tribes” etc. Jesus Christ when he came as God made man, he noticed these divisions among mankind hence on his last supper with his apostles he prayed, “That they may be one” (John.17: 11). He said it at the last supper to show how dear that unity is to his heart. St. Paul in trying to re-echo Jesus’ teaching among the Corinthians says, “Has Christ been divided?” (1Cor1:13). Whenever you gather among yourselves as Christians, there should be neither Jew nor Gentile, male or female, you are all one before God (Gal 3:28).The story of Good Samaritan is one of the ways through which Christ tried to tell us that we ought to look at one another fundamentally as image and likeness of God. The presence among Christians of tribal sentiments and loyalty to one’s ethnic group must be a scandal of great proportion to all of us who claim to be the agents for spreading Christ’s kingdom of love, and brotherhood in the world.

However, it is unclear if the standard model of intensification is theoretically or empirically justified. This leaves social scientists unable to make reasonable inferences about the relationship between intensification and the evolution of social complexity in past societies. To remedy this problem, I derive a novel model of intensification from human macroecology, settlement scaling theory, human behavioral ecology, cultural evolutionary theory, and niche construction theory. The standard and cultural niche construction models are formalized and their predictions are tested using a comprehensive ethnographic data set that describes food production in forty human societies ranging in complexity from foraging bands to agricultural states. Analysis of the ethnographic record suggests we reject the standard model and tentatively accept the cultural niche construction model.

I use conceptual blending analysis to analyze five representative, very small messages about solar technology that went viral (nanovirals).  I identify four distinct viral strategies that vary according to the number of belief systems used, and whether the viral message confirmed or contradicted central beliefs.  Finally, I use information systems modeling to depict a common viral mechanism underlying the strategies. I conclude with a practical heuristic to guide the design of nanoviral messages.

This paper determines the availability and accessibility of 3D printing technology in low-income communities through public libraries and gives insights on how libraries use 3D printers. By examining the 2013 Digital Inclusion Survey and conducting interviews, we found that libraries are quickly acquiring 3D printers; however, the technology is not being fully adopted by the patrons due to the lack of training, software and practical applications of the technology. Also, we found out that the cost to use a 3D printer in public libraries is relatively low, and does not prevent patrons from accessing the technology.

In this study we used data from a UK cohort to answer three related research questions. Is school enjoyment patterned by gender, socioeconomic background of cognitive ability? How well does school enjoyment explain later educational achievement? Does early school enjoyment at age 6 associate with social or gender differences in later educational achievement at age 16? Our results show that school enjoyment measured at age 6 is associated with gender and cognitive ability but not family socioeconomic background. For example, girls were twice as likely to report enjoying school than boys (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.56, 2.48). School enjoyment strongly associated with later achievement even after adjustment for socioeconomic background and cognitive ability; pupils who reported enjoying school scored on average 14.4 (95% CI: 6.9, 21.9) more points, equivalent to almost a 3-grade increase across all GCSE’s, and were 29% more likely to obtain 5+ A*-Cs including Maths and English (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.7) than those who did not enjoy school.

We propose here both a new explanation for the endurance of these statements as well as an analysis of the power, limitations, and possibilities of aphorisms. By drawing from the critical scholarship concerned with aphorisms, we demonstrate that some of the allure of the classical sociological texts derives from their form, and particularly their reliance on the relative autonomy of the aphorism. Through examining Marx’s “opiate of the people,” Weber’s “iron cage,” and, briefly, two more contemporary sociological aphorisms, we suggest that aphorisms have an ambivalent role in sociological theory: they make claims memorable even as they potentially oversimplify complex arguments. Yet that very simplification can provide a point of focus for productive misreading and reinterpretation.",TRUE,FALSE,aphorisms|Bacon|iron cage|Marx|opiate of the people|rhetoric|rhetoric of science|rhetoric of social science|sociological theory|sociology|theory|Weber,2019-08-09T22:46:12.899697,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T22:44:23.887930,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/citation/,u64f7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4dba44272b140018edb747/,5d4dba44272b140018edb747,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u64f7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u64f7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u64f7,NA

METHOD: A grid comparing bioethic stances for the major world religions was created (https://goo.gl/ZpwJL7).  The consensus, or lack thereof, within each religious group is displayed in the grid as a color coded heatmap.  An online quiz (http://bit.ly/2017ethics1) was also created and tested as an educational resource by administered the quiz twice to four years of medical students at Marian University.  The open access online quiz resource emails users personalized results comparing their last score to their prior attempts, against other quiz takers at their institution, and against an average of all quiz takers across institutions.  RESULTS: User demographics were analyzed and their knowledge of religions bioethical stances was determined to not be affected by age or sex, but was found to improve as they progressed through medical school.  There was greater variance between ethical questions than there was between quiz takers for each ethical issue, highlighting specific biomedical ethical issues that may benefit from increased educational time in curricula.  There also appeared to be differences based on the quiz takers religious background but the sample size for most backgrounds was too small to extrapolate the results to a wider population.  DISCUSSION: This bioethics quiz provides a resource to help educate those in the medical community, and will continue to generate data as it is used moving forward elucidating which populations should be targeted for increased educational intervention.",TRUE,FALSE,abortion|Bioethics|ethics|medical school|viral therapy,2019-08-09T17:46:28.925722,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T17:42:54.884011,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|Arts and Humanities|Religion|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/citation/,8vh56,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fkvyw/,fkvyw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4d92b90f488d0018918645/,5d4d92b90f488d0018918645,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vh56/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8vh56/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8vh56,NA
