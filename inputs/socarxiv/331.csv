Our objective is to utilise metaphor to instigate critical reflection about the nature of social media use behaviour and the role of habitual social media use in our experiences of reality. The first metaphor, social media as a town square, draws attention to the centrality of social media platforms in their users’ lives, fear of missing out, augmented reality and digital dualism. Through the second metaphor, social media as a beauty pageant, we explore self-presentation or image crafting, social comparison and self-evaluation. The third metaphor, social media as a parliament, emphasises the role of social media platforms as spaces for online deliberation and we consider social media capital, homophily and polarisation as themes. Finally, we explore anonymity, deindividuation and deceptive self-presentation through our fourth metaphor, social media as a masquerade ball. We argue that social media scholars can use these and other metaphors to enhance communication of their research findings. Additionally, we believe that social media metaphors can be powerful pedagogical and communication tools, particularly when working with students for whom high levels of social media use is the norm.",TRUE,FALSE,Beauty pageant|masquerade ball|Metaphor|parliament|Social Media|Town Square,2020-02-01T03:18:42.470718,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-01T03:18:19.532315,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/citation/,58bvj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e340dd7f6631d012c5a320a/,5e340dd7f6631d012c5a320a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58bvj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58bvj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58bvj,NA

The method has been implemented for Stata in the popular oaxaca program for cross-sectional analyses.  In the last decades, however, research questions have been more often focused on the decomposition of group-based differences in change over time, e.g. diverging income trajectories, as well as decomposition of change in differences between groups, e.g. change in the gender pay gap over time.  We review five existing methods for the decomposition of changes in group means and contribute a complementing interventionist perspective, which is suitable for applications with a clear before-after comparison.
        These decompositions of levels and changes over time can be implemented using a first version of the program {\tt xtoaxaca}, which works as a postestimation command for different regression commands in Stata.

Chorus and related diversity are discussed among chorus, choir, signing in unison, polyphonic singing and vocal harmony as well as “grand vocal cycle” coined by Chinese etc. The term, chorus in English, is also used for singing in unison and is still dancing together in a musical. However, community group singing in unison was not considered as chorus by some Chinese conductors. By review of literatures and videos, we discussed related terms and definition. We thought that chant is useful in popular singing and community activities. Singing in unison is still a kind of normal enjoyment of music. Singing while acting and dancing is one of the ways of a chorus performance.

As such it can occur in all media involving audio and is a key component of material news cultures. During the past decades, one of the most widely replicated findings in a wide range of countries has been that the number of sound bites is shrinking. This has attracted attention from journalism scholars and the general public because shrinking sound bites are indicative of a move toward more interpretive or even interventionist models of journalism and because they have well‐documented detrimental consequences for the quality of public discourse that journalism helps to construct.

Rental listings have increasingly moved online over the past two decades and, in turn, online platforms like Craigslist are now central to the search process. Do these technology platforms serve as information equalizers or do they reflect traditional information inequalities that correlate with neighborhood sociodemographics? We synthesize and extend analyses of millions of US Craigslist rental listings and find they supply significantly different volumes, quality, and types of information in different communities. Technology platforms have the potential to broaden, diversify, and equalize housing search information, but they rely on landlord behavior and, in turn, likely will not reach this potential without a significant redesign or policy intervention.

We introduce a new criterion based on two constraints, accounting for both ecological and human sustainability. The ecological constraint is defined through   a novel indicator, the eco-balance, grounded on the well known concept of ecological footprint and the new concept of population biodensity. The human sustainability constraint is based on the minimum per capita consumption of biocapacity needed to achieve an acceptable level of human well-being. The application of our criterion to world countries shows where technological improvements and changes in consumption patterns are sufficient to reach sustainability, and where actions on population and  restoring ecological capital are also needed.

Shifts in the distributions of temperature and precipitation may increase the volatility of farmers' yields, leading to rising but insurable risk, and/or reduce mean yields and thus cause permanent reductions in the returns to farming.  We use a multi-run climate model to predict the future distribution of yields at the district level for sixteen major crops.  For the average district, we project a sharp decline in mean agricultural revenue, but relatively small shifts in volatility.  This is because weather draws resulting in extremely low agricultural revenue -- what had once been 1-in-100-year events -- are predicted to become the norm by the end of the century, implying substantial uninsurable losses from the changing climate.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|CESM-LENS|climate change|crop yield|economics|extreme events|India|yield volatility,2020-01-31T08:33:42.978176,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-31T08:33:29.752474,FALSE,NA,no,ICRISAT Village Dynamics in South Asia (VDSA).

The main objective is to deepen the discussion on the concept of social costs in Kapp (Frigato, 2006), and its relationship with public health, also reflecting on the role of the State in the implementation of Public Health Policies. 
Methods: we follow the guidelines of Meneghetti (2011), understanding that in the essay, the object is studied in its dialectical condition, not necessarily requiring empirical proof. It starts from the guiding questions for theoretical argumentation, seeking to understand the object through associations or analogies, without the formalism of traditional scientific technique. 
Results: we can see that the Kappian perspective on social costs, expands its reach to the political level, and the concept can serve as a basis for the analysis of public policies. In particular, on public health, this concept contributes to the reflection of the role of the State, in social protection and in its permanent relationship with the market. 
Conclusion: the Kappian perspective perceives the circularity and interdependence in the relationship between health and the costs of capitalism, favours new insights and a critical reading of the associated institutional political phenomena, power games and conflicts around the public-private relationship in health.",TRUE,FALSE,Kapp|public health|public policies|social costs,2020-01-31T08:35:22.242854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-31T08:35:09.566164,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/citation/,wcxm8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e32bbfd4b201000642103f3/,5e32bbfd4b201000642103f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wcxm8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wcxm8,NA

We demonstrate that for one impact measure of all major oil crops —threatened species per volume produced —coconut, together with maize, affect far more species than all other major oil crops, including palm oil.

By doing so, they collect personal information of the user, similar to other online services. While privacy concerns in an online (website-) context are widely studied, research in the context of chatbot-interaction is lacking. This study investigates the extent to which chatbots with human-like cues influence perceptions of anthropomorphism (i.e., attribution of human like characteristics), privacy concerns, and consequently, information disclosure, attitudes and recommendation adherence. Findings show that a human-like chatbot leads to more information disclosure, and recommendation adherence mediated by higher perceived anthropomorphism and subsequently, lower privacy concerns in comparison to a machine-like chatbot. This result does not hold in comparison to a website; human-like chatbot and website were perceived as equally high in anthropomorphism.
