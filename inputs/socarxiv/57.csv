Coopting Occupational Gatekeepers to Produce Normalized Trust in Platform-mediated Interorganizational Relationships,"Interorganizational trust plays an important role in facilitating business relationships, especially for the organizational adoption of new services. Prior research suggests that interorganizational trust develops when the trustor has adequate confidence in the reliability of the trustee’s services. Nevertheless, reliability breakdowns are also an inevitable part of service provisioning. Such breakdowns are especially prominent and visible in the context of platform-based services. Yet, platform-based services continue to be adopted and used by organizational customers. This increased adoption and use of such services despite its inconsistent reliability pose the following question: how is trust produced in platform-mediated interorganizational relationships? To examine this question, I conduct a 20-month field study of a cloud computing platform provider and its customers, focusing on the practices of trust production in the wake of reliability breakdowns. I describe customer concerns about the platform’s inconsistent reliability that hampered the development of interorganizational trust. I then identify four practices of trust work enacted by the platform provider to address some of these concerns and to coopt the occupational gatekeepers in customer organizations who are responsible for technology adoption decisions. Following this, I describe how and why these occupational gatekeepers performed justification work to rationalize the continued use of the platform despite its inconsistent reliability. Together, trust work and justification work facilitate the co-production of interorganizational trust through normalizing reliability breakdowns as “business-as-usual” events. Synthesizing these findings, I develop a normalization model of trust production and discuss the implications of normalized trust for platform-mediated interorganizational relationships in the digital economy.",TRUE,FALSE,cloud computing|economic sociology|interorganizational relationships|justification|occupations|organization theory|platforms|professions|sociology of work|trust,2021-03-18T11:14:44.389024,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18T11:14:32.363563,FALSE,NA,no,Confidential/anonymized data,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",INFORMS,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/citation/,w2kfn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60525fe1e8afef00335f31f7/,60525fe1e8afef00335f31f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2kfn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w2kfn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w2kfn

Using birth data from Florida and Ohio counties through February 2021, this analysis examines whether and how much falling birth rates were associated with local pandemic conditions, specifically infection rates and reductions in geographic mobility. Results show that the vast majority of counties experienced declining births, suggestive of a general influence of the pandemic, but also that declines were steeper in places with greater prevalence of COVID-19 infections and more extensive reductions in mobility. The latter result is consistent with more direct influences of the pandemic on family planning or sexual behavior.

Denmark is an exemplar country with clear legislative practices to support gender quality, and differences between men and women with regards to unpaid house and care work are less substantial than many other places. It is largely unknown whether Danish academics experienced the same level of COVID-19-related disruption to productivity and whether women, or academics with children in general experienced more serious disruption.  To investigate the local effects of the lockdown in Danish academia, we (i) performed an analysis of preprints in a single academic field and (ii) surveyed academics employed at Denmark’s largest University.  We found that parents with young children worked less hours per day during the lockdown than academics with older or no children and that this effect was more pronounced in women with young children. The vast majority of both male and female scholars with teaching responsibility reported more time spent on teaching. A larger proportion of junior academics felt their productivity decreased compared to senior academics. Additionally, analyses of the number self-reported submitted grants and manuscripts did not show any differences differ by gender or career level. However, the gender gap did increase during the first month of the lockdown with respect to the number of manuscripts submitted to preprint servers.

The impact of the development of the global and regional strategic environment. Indonesia also cannot remove the influence of the development of ideologies from outside which threatens the unity of the state. The research currently being carried out is to determine the extent to which state policy programs regarding state defense can be implemented in universities in Indonesia. This is interesting given the vulnerability of students to be influenced by radical understandings currently developing. Researchers analyzed the implementation of this state defense policy using the theory of Gerorge Edward III, which analyzes the focus under study using factors, Communication, Resources, Disposition and Bureaucratic Structure. The results of the research show that the state defense policy that has been implemented so far still needs to be further improved, so far the state defense program with the civic education model is only carried out at the beginning when students enter university. Furthermore, no more citizenship programs were found. the related entities also have not found the best model so that the state defense program can be integrated and interactive. The recommendation from the current research is that state defense in universities needs to be optimized again, considering that several cases were found to involve students from high schools. Students are the nation's human resource which is very valuable to determine this nation in the future. Policies on national defense, especially the state defense program in higher education, must receive serious attention from the government, so that the younger generation, especially students, can avoid radicalism and terrorism.",TRUE,FALSE,Defence State|Public Policy Implementation|Universities|Urban Areas,2021-03-17T16:54:06.965440,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T16:53:41.877888,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/citation/,nwyug,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6051faf680460f00f097c792/,6051faf680460f00f097c792,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwyug/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nwyug/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.01.265,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nwyug

I develop a theory of treaty signing that emphasizes the domestic factors that motivate a government to sign BITs. Using a panel dataset of developing countries from 1960 to 2010, I find that governments scarce in natural resources are more likely to sign BITs compared to their richer counterparts. In addition, governments with middle levels of property rights are more likely to sign BITs compared to those with low or high levels. Finally, the most likely BIT signers are resource-scarce countries with middle levels of property rights. That strategic dynamics exist in BIT signing has implications for assessing the effects of these treaties in other issue areas such as trade, human rights, and the environment.",TRUE,FALSE,Bilateral Investment Treaty|Foreign Direct Investment|Natural Resources|Property Rights,2021-03-17T16:55:01.411784,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T16:54:42.736675,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/citation/,z54db,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6051f9a85ca6c70102787b3f/,6051f9a85ca6c70102787b3f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z54db/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z54db/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.01.264,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z54db

The flow of this voyage is used for international interests. Facing the factual and potential threats that occur today, the Sunda Strait waters has an important role for international interest, particularly in Indonesia, since the position of its capital city is relatively close. This study is using a qualitative descriptive method of phenomenology and using the theory of George Edward III. The results of the study indicate that the variable communication between related entities shows that it still needs to be optimized since it is still not integrated. In the variable resources of each entity related to the security of the Sunda Strait are still have many limitations, particularly in budgetary resources that are related to the availability of other resources. The disposition variable is still found by persons related to the attitude of the executor who makes the obstacle an opportunity to do negative things, and in the variable structure of the bureaucracy, opportunities are still found to optimize the security of the international shipping channel in the Sunda Strait.",TRUE,FALSE,ALKI I|International Shipping Channel|Sea Defense Strategy|Sunda Strait,2021-03-17T16:55:49.008059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T16:55:09.262945,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/citation/,rky7w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6051f86b80460f00f097bae3/,6051f86b80460f00f097bae3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rky7w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rky7w/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.01.263,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rky7w
