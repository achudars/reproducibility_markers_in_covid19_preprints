Likewise, a person's ideas can be traced where the origin comes from through memetic tracing. This article discusses case studies in several works which are assumed to be works of design product plagiarism at one of the famous universities in Indonesia. The plagiarism process is investigated through tracking changes in their memes. The research method was carried out by investigation. Data collection and analysis through field studies and in-depth interviews with participants who are actors and users of plagiarism products. The research was conducted in 2017.

However, in 2015, some Google Translate users in Indonesia, filed complaints, asserting that the machine was often inaccurate, speculating that it could only translate languages at the micro-level of words and phrases, rather than complete sentences or paragraphs. This research works to examine the accuracy as well as the shortcomings of Google Translate, in the context of English to Indonesian translations, in order to critically engage the complaints made by Google users. For the purpose of this study, 80 English sentences were translated using Google Translate and assessed for accuracy using a table adapted from Memsource criteria. Both the original sentences and their translated versions were analyzed using a sentence pair matrix to determine the machine’s failings and areas for improvement. The results challenged those initial speculations which suggested Google Translate is only effective with words and phrases. On the contrary, Memsource proved to be a useful tool in demonstrating a reasonable level of accuracy, accurately translating 60.37% of Indonesian-English sentences and vice versa.",TRUE,FALSE,English-Indonesian Translation|Google Translate|Memsource|Sentence-Pair Matrix|Statistical Machine Translation,2020-12-13T15:39:01.816937,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-13T15:38:50.910562,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/citation/,dz3e2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd5bf8a149e75026b028345/,5fd5bf8a149e75026b028345,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dz3e2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dz3e2/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.03.04.161,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dz3e2

The study was instigated by reportedly persistent increase in the cases of employee attrition in higher education institutions in Uganda in spite of Government’s attempts to improve the working conditions of the university employees. Using the cross-sectional survey research design, data were collected with the use of an adapted self-administered questionnaire from a sample of 722 academic and non-academic employees of three public and three private universities in Uganda. The results of structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated that HRMPs were significant positive predictors of affective commitment (rewards: β =.225; p&lt;.001), promotions: β =.228; p&lt;.001; and job security: β = .141; p&lt;.001). However, HRM practices were negative predictors of turnover intentions (rewards: β = -.228; p&lt;.001; promotion, β = -.215; p&lt;.001; job security, β = -.138; p&lt;.001). Furthermore, affective commitment was indeed a significant mediator of the relationship between HRMPs and turnover intentions of university employees. These findings made us draw the conclusion that when university employees perceive the institution’s HRMPs to be favourable, they will not only become committed to the organisation but also desire to remain working longer for it. Therefore, we recommend that the university managers in Uganda and similar countries should formulate and practise human resource management styles that do not only spur employee commitment but also enhance staff retention.",TRUE,FALSE,Affective Commitment|Human Resource Management Practices|Turnover Intentions|Universities,2020-12-13T15:38:21.914470,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-13T15:38:09.934625,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/citation/,9tqmu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuksr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/relationships/node/,zuksr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd5bd6d0694b702aaf3b675/,5fd5bd6d0694b702aaf3b675,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9tqmu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9tqmu/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1993.03.04.160,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9tqmu

Methods: Pre and post tests were taken and Torrance Creative Thinking Test, form (A) was used. The students in control and experimental group were given TTCT form (A). In this study through TTCT form (A) it was tested to what extent teaching through drama nurtured creative thinking of tribal students. It tested the ability of student's individual competence, to be fluent, flexible and original. Results and conclusion: There is a statistically significant difference in mean scores of the pre and post test of the experimental group. The mean of post grades of experimental group is more than the mean of pre grades of experimental group. It indicated that there are statistically significant differences in students' pre and post grades of experimental group. It means teaching English through drama is effective and it fosters creativity of tribal students. Practical application: Teachers in other tribal/rural/urban colleges can teach using drama in their classes to make teaching-learning of foreign language effective and for fostering the creativity of the students. The Torrance test can be used in other research to investigate the influence of teaching subjects other than English. Further research is needed to investigate the influence of teaching English language using drama on teacher’s performance in tribal classroom. Further research can be done to investigate the influence of teaching subjects other than English using drama on the development of tribal students' achievement. Further research can be done to investigate the influence of teaching subjects other than English using drama on the development of tribal students' creative thinking. Originality/Cognitive value: Draws attention toward the effectiveness of teaching English using drama and nurturing students' creative thinking specific for tribal students.

Even today, Chinese slogans are often employed by the government to promote policies and socio-cultural values. This paper, adopting an ecolinguistic approach, explores the development of Chinese slogans during the four economic stages since the foundation of PRC (People’s Republic of China) to find out how slogans influence the relationship between men, and man and the ecosystem. It is discovered that Chinese slogans in the recent decades have experienced great changes in terms of discourse type, the beneficial degree of discourse and the ecosophy they carry. They changed gradually from destructive discourse to harmonious discourse and they reflect the transition of Chinese ecological philosophy—from ‘anthropocentrism’, ‘growthism’, and ‘classism’ to ‘harmonism’.

In this research, I will base on the previous studies about maritime diplomacy and conclude the changes of Indian maritime diplomacy during Modi administration. Economic interdependence makes it difficult to ignore neighbouring states’ impact on energy transportation and regional cooperation.

This paper was aimed at examining that linkage, to see if it took place in reality, or rather if voting needs to be looked at as a choice made based on class and stature, not racial background. To examine the issue at hand, 2016 voting patterns were compared to 2020 exit polls based on racial background. The findings showed that support for President Trump rose across all races, sometimes more than doubling. At the same time, votes were analyzed based on a breakdown by class. For the study, three batches of districts were chosen: the poor of America, the average of America, and the rich of America.

This chapter argues that social scientists largely treated war as a national security challenge, a tool of statecraft that could be wielded wisely by expert-informed policy officials. In the hands of international relations experts, think tank analysts, and a new cohort of quantitative political scientists, war was not a social problem but rather a managerial challenge.

We found that: (1) Attention to SET originated in the US in the 1970s, spreading to German-speaking countries in the mid-1990s and continuing in China and Latin America in the early 2000s. (2) SET is commonly viewed as a control tool deserving methodological improvement, while bias is debated in the US. We also found local trajectories: (3) Whereas in the US and Latin America SET is primarily seen as a management tool, German-speaking and Chinese authors reflect more on improving teaching. Chinese scholars consider SET a valid instrument for state control associated with artificial intelligence. Also, (4) SET is commonly used in medical education in the US and the German-speaking region and in physical education in China.
