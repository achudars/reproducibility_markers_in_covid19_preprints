Building on the 'capital as power' framework, I propose that capitalists earn their income not from any productive asset, but from the legal right to command a corporate hierarchy. In short, I hypothesize that capitalist income stems from  hierarchical power. Based on this thinking, I hypothesize that the capitalist fraction of an individual's income is a gradient function of  hierarchical power (which I define as the number of subordinates under one's control). Using data from US CEOs, I find evidence that this is true. Furthermore, a hierarchical model of the United States that generalizes this data accurately reproduces many aspects of the US distribution of capitalist income, including the relation between income size and capitalist income fraction.   This evidence suggests that the ownership structure of US society is closely linked to the hierarchical structure of firms. This has important  implications for the study of income distribution.",TRUE,FALSE,capitalist income|functional income distribution|hierarchy|income distribution|personal income distribution,2018-07-16T22:13:05.460934,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-16T22:12:40.520285,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/citation/,u8epv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rn3uc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/relationships/node/,rn3uc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4cb93625fdcd0010e619ec/,5b4cb93625fdcd0010e619ec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u8epv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u8epv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u8epv,NA

A growing focus on these emission sources has led to the development of carbon offset protocols that could enable payment to farmers for reducing fertilizer use or implementing other nitrogen management strategies.  Despite the development of several protocols, the current regional scope is narrow, adoption by farmers is low, and policy implementation of protocols has a significant time lag.  Here we utilize existing research and policy structures to propose an “umbrella” approach for nitrogen management greenhouse gas emissions protocols for carbon markets that has the potential to streamline the policy implementation and acceptance of protocols.  We suggest that the umbrella protocol could set forth standard definitions common across multiple protocol options, and then “modules” could be further developed as scientific evidence advances.  Modules could be developed for specific crops, regions, and practices.  We identify a policy process that could facilitate this development in concert with emerging scientific research and conclude by acknowledging potential benefits and limitations of the approach.",TRUE,FALSE,climate policy|farmer|GHG emissions,2018-07-17T10:41:06.210277,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-17T10:40:41.929449,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/citation/,w96xb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dc397/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/relationships/node/,dc397,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4cb4f725fdcd000fe6257f/,5b4cb4f725fdcd000fe6257f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w96xb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w96xb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w96xb,NA

We reviewed a large body of literature to address this question and identified 11 studies that compare the governance and conservation results of mixed-gender resource management groups with men-only or women-only groups. The assembled evidence, while neither wide nor deep, forms the basis for a preliminary theory of change as to how participation of women in resource management groups can result in improved resource governance and conservation. Compared to men-only or women-only resource management groups, mixed-gender groups in the included studies tend to have greater community compliance with resource use rules, more transparency and accountability, better conflict resolution, increased patrolling and enforcement, and greater equity of access to resources. They also tend to have more effective resource conservation.

Von Glasersfeld aimed to emphasize that knowledge is subjectively constructed rather than objectively perceived through senses. In its original form, Radical Constructivism does not include any tenet about the outside reality, and so does not present a formal metaphysics.

G. Hawtrey was not a man of the backwaters. Through the parallel study of Treasury files and Hawtrey's scholarly publications, this work reveals his direct influence upon the most commanding minds of the Treasury and the Bank of England, the two institutions that, after WWI, shared primary responsibility over the British austerity agenda. After the war, Hawtrey advocated drastic budgetary and monetary rigor in the name of price stabilization. From 1922, Hawtrey admitted the need to decrease the bank rate; yet he remained an adamant supporter of the Gold Standard, insisting on its maintenance even if it required further monetary revaluation. Hawtrey's policy prescriptions stemmed directly from his economic model. The ""crowding out argument,"" the centrality of credit and of savings, together with the operational priority of technocratic institutions, were essential theoretical underpinnings of Hawtrey's agenda: implementing the so-called ""Treasury view.""",TRUE,FALSE,Austerity|Hawtrey|Treasury View,2018-07-13T10:14:23.791641,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-13T09:50:24.420510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History,Journal of the History of economic thought,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/citation/,2rjw9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kz2e9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/relationships/node/,kz2e9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b478084cda0b1001089a03b/,5b478084cda0b1001089a03b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rjw9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2rjw9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2rjw9,NA

Compensation benchmarking and the biasing of executive pay,"The disclosure of compensation peer groups is argued to provide shareholders with valuable information that can be used to scrutinize CEO compensation. However, research suggests that there are substantial incentives for executives and directors to bias the compensation peer group upward such that the CEO can extract additional rent. We leverage the idea that reciprocated peer nominations are unlikely to be biased in order to construct counterfactual peer groups that allow us to measure the bias of disclosed peer groups. Analyses of eleven years of comprehensive data on compensation peer groups demonstrate that the average ﬁrm uses an upwardly biased peer group. The size of the bias increases when incentives and opportunities to do so are more pronounced. Speciﬁcally, results show that bias is larger when ﬁnancial targets are not met and when exercising discretion in the selection of peer ﬁrms is justiﬁable. More importantly, upward bias in compensation peer groups is highly predictive of an increase in CEO compensation – suggesting that there is a strong incentive for CEOs to strategically select peers. Finally, while average peer group bias has gone down in recent years, the predictive eﬀect of bias on pay has gone up. These ﬁndings call into question the practical impact of recent eﬀorts to introduce greater transparency into the process for determining executive compensation.",TRUE,FALSE,executive compensation|income inequality|peer benchmarking|social comparisons,2018-07-13T10:12:41.784699,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-13T09:48:24.789241,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/citation/,r3cha,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/97ebq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/relationships/node/,97ebq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b472f00d46a08000e277249/,5b472f00d46a08000e277249,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3cha/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r3cha/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r3cha,https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3151
