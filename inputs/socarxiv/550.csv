Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units to create variables that control for social, economic or political contexts can dramatically alter analyses. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude in the literature and in their own projects. By using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we are able to construct-for all persons in the US-individual-specific contexts, which we group according to the Census-assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual-specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the magnitude of variation in context for an individual with respect to the published measures using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy-a measure of ethno-racial diversity), we find that block-level Census statistics frequently do not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the contextual variables at all three scales. Finally, we show that within-unit variation is greater in some parts of the country than in others. We publish county-level estimates of the SDIC statistics that enable scholars to assess whether mis-specification in context variables is likely to alter analytic findings when measured at any of the three common Census units.",TRUE,FALSE,census data|context|race,2018-07-02T11:39:08.656456,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-14T23:56:21.639465,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/citation/,vhmzq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y23xt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/relationships/node/,y23xt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a848f177166bd000eb82303/,5a848f177166bd000eb82303,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vhmzq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vhmzq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vhmzq,NA

Background: Individuals on their families for substantial financial support well into early adulthood, even as young adults perceive independence as a key marker of adulthood. Given known variation in transitions to adulthood and unequal exposure to financial precariousness across social groups, the authors ask whether heterogeneity emerges with regards to the timing of financial independence and types of support received, and how differences in pathways to independence may matter for financial security later in young adulthood.

Method: The authors estimate group-based trajectory models of four indicators of financial independence for 1,719 young adults from age 18 - 27 using data from the 2005-2015 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/). These trajectories are then used to estimate predicted levels of financial security at the end of the study period, using logistic and linear regression analysis. 

Results: Results show that paths to young adults’ financial independence are best characterized by four types of trajectories: Consistently Independent (23%), Quickly Independent (41%), Gradually Independent (23%), and Consistently Supported (13%), with types and duration of support varying substantially across trajectories. The authors find that young adults experiencing trajectories characterized by lower levels of familial support also report higher levels of financial insecurity by the end of the survey. 

Conclusion: The findings suggest that the patterning and timing of financial independence in the transition to adulthood has implications for financial wellbeing.",TRUE,FALSE,Aging and the Life Course|Children and Youth|Demography|Family|Inequality|Population|Poverty|Transition to Adulthood,2018-07-02T11:39:08.505649,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-14T19:07:07.545694,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/citation/,t6ar5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sbygc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/relationships/node/,sbygc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8466e795bb7b0010373127/,5a8466e795bb7b0010373127,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6ar5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t6ar5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t6ar5,NA

Independent of where they occur, the mechanisms of informal governance are expected to be largely defined by the overlapping formal and informal relational structures of these networks. This network theoretic approach yields the hypothesis that timely access to resources such as relevant information and the ability to influence key players within networks should depend on structural positions of actors; their role in the policy process should be constrained and enabled by the structural role they occupy in relation to their direct and indirect contacts. These assumptions will be tested for the case of the ongoing reform of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The central question is whether the structure of the network of European, national and sub-national interest representatives involved in the CFP and the positions of these actors may be used to explain the flow of information during the policy process and the access of actors to these information when they are not yet available to a wider public. In this paper, methods to identify the respective actor population and to measure the relations between these actors as well as ways to uncover information flows will be discussed.

Challenges in assessing the EU-level integrity system,"For over a decade now, Transparency International (TI) has undertaken National Integrity System (NIS) assessments to determine a country’s effectiveness in fighting corruption, making recommendations for institutional or policy reform.

In some contexts, incentive systems help promote collective action, while in other parts of the space, incentive systems can actually lead people to enforce outcomes that no one wants.

Recent work in stratification and demography argues for the importance of multiple familial generations in status attainment and other transmission processes. Health disparities research in this area generally assumes that the rewards of attainment are paid forward across generations, meaning grandparent and parent achievements give children a health advantage. However, an emerging literature suggests that mortality risk in old age may be more closely related to the attainments of parents and adult children. 

OBJECTIVE
We develop a new approach to understanding family attainments and mortality in later life and test the multigenerational structure of health disparities suggested by the long arm, personal attainment, and social foreground perspectives. 

METHODS
The analysis uses nearly complete mortality data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, a representative sample of U.S. men aged 45 to 59 in 1966. 

RESULTS
We find that older men with parents who farmed had a median age of death that was 1.3 years higher than those who had parents with manual occupations, and men with adult children who had 16 or more years of schooling had a median age of death almost 2 years higher than those with children with 12 or fewer years of schooling. 

CONCLUSIONS
We find evidence of a three-generation model in which parent occupation, personal wealth, and adult child attainments are independently associated with older men’s mortality. 

CONTRIBUTION
These findings highlight the relevance of adjacent generations for health and mortality in later life and the importance of historical context for accurately measuring socioeconomic attainments in different generations and cohorts.",TRUE,FALSE,adult children|health disparities|mortality|multigenerational|older men|socioeconomic status,2018-07-02T11:39:04.522230,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-10T17:03:52.318599,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/citation/,vcxg3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8pc4q/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/relationships/node/,8pc4q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a7f2426e83246000decbf56/,5a7f2426e83246000decbf56,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vcxg3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vcxg3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vcxg3,https://doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2018.39.26

An emerging literature suggests that the socioeconomic attainments of adjacent generations, one's parents and adult children, provide an array of life-extending resources in old age. Prior research, however, has demonstrated neither how multigenerational resources are implicated in women's longevity nor how racial disparities faced by Silent Generation women may differentially structure the relationships between socioeconomic attainments and mortality. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women, the analysis provides evidence of a three-generation model in which parent occupation, personal wealth, and adult child education are independently associated with women's mortality.
