But how does the expansion of police presence in poor urban communities affect educational outcomes? Previous research points at multiple mechanisms with opposing effects. This article presents the first causal evidence of the impact of aggressive policing on minority youths’ educational performance. Under Operation Impact, the New York Police Department (NYPD) saturated high-crime areas with additional police officers with the mission to engage in aggressive, order-maintenance policing. To estimate the effect of this policing program, we use administrative data from more than 250,000 adolescents age 9 to 15 and a difference-in-differences approach based on variation in the timing of police surges across neighborhoods. We find that exposure to police surges significantly reduced test scores for African American boys, consistent with their greater exposure to policing. The size of the effect increases with age, but there is no discernible effect for African American girls and Hispanic students. Aggressive policing can thus lower educational performance for some minority groups. These findings provide evidence that the consequences of policing extend into key domains of social life, with implications for the educational trajectories of minority youth and social inequality more broadly.",TRUE,FALSE,Education|Inequality|Policing|Race,2018-08-29T20:42:25.519259,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-29T20:41:41.831131,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/citation/,rdchf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5mzue/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/relationships/node/,5mzue,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b86eeeeb57ff50016ec9413/,5b86eeeeb57ff50016ec9413,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rdchf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rdchf/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122419826020,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rdchf

Parental evaluation of child’s participation is often the decision-making factor in the process of special education and/or rehabilitation.
Aims: Examine and compare home and community participation of children with CP and typical development (TD) and the associations between their parents’ desire for change and participation dimensions in both settings.
Methods and procedures: This cross-sectional study included a convenience sample of 110 children with CP (55% males; mean age 12.7 years) and 134 children with TD (49% males; mean age 12.1 years). The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) was used. 
Outcomes and results: Home and community participation and environmental supportiveness of children with CP were lower compared to children with TD (p &lt; .001, family income controlled). The effect sizes indicated that there may be no clinically important difference in participation frequency. Parents of children with CP desired change if participation was less diverse at home, less frequent in the community, or if involvement was lower in both settings (environmental supportiveness and income controlled).
Conclusions and implications: At home, parents expressed a desire for change more intensely through the range of activities, while parents of children with TD emphasized participation frequency. In the community, parents of children with CP equally perceived participation diversity and focused more on frequency and involvement.",TRUE,FALSE,change|children with cerebral palsy|environmental supportiveness|Home and community participation|parental perspective|participation,2018-08-28T11:24:41.468729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-28T11:24:26.443780,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/citation/,wqvh8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3jnb9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/relationships/node/,3jnb9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b850d7b465d2100180765ca/,5b850d7b465d2100180765ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wqvh8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wqvh8/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2018.06.010,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wqvh8

Probing into the instrumental efforts made via the colonizer’s language entails investigating the way the colonizer sought to racially segregate the Moroccan subjects, ascertain inaccessibility to religion, and instill the colonial language and the associated foreign ‘elitist’ values via the educational policies initially established within the postcolonial project. French language reflects a colonialism, of which the nature was racial, religious, linguistic, and identity based. The ensuing postcolonial effects of the curriculum adopted during the ‘protectorate’ have given birth to the surviving outcomes of Francization and the need to adopt French—a language that is foreign, ‘prestigious,’ ‘elitist,’ and practical in the job market.

It puts forward irony as the vehicle for shifting the traditional stature of the hero, and his successful errand towards the anti-hero as the apotheosis of doom and failure. The paper suggests history’s force of abruptness as undeniable in the unsuccessful quest of the hero through the shattering historical events Charles Frazier (1950-) and Philip Roth (1933-) create in their modern novels, Cold Mountain (1997) and Nemesis (2010). It furthermore gets in-depth within the romantic psyche of both heroes to get across that their ‘consciousness’ is, in fact, mythical and not historical. Absence of historical consciousness in these characters, it is explained, participates considerably in the collapse which gets them eventually. Even the pastoral round which their aspiration hovers becomes a site for death and paralysis instead of the rejuvenation they sought after passionately.

Rapid changes in labor force participation, access to high-paying jobs, and gender attitudes have radically altered the meaning of education for women’s lives and their dependence on the socioeconomic attainments of their families.

Overall, the health of women did not change substantially across cohorts, but results did uncover cohort differences among low-educated women that were linked to parental and spousal educational attainments and personal earnings.

In the study of a collection of performances, then, applause can serve as a signifier of structures such as the point at which the performance itself has changed from introductory comments to main performance, from single speaker to a question-and-answer period with the audience, or from the end of one poem to the start of the next, but it can also serve, as used here, as a discovery point for considering how a poet interacts with an audience in a particular poetry culture.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-08-28T00:48:24.781547,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-28T00:45:35.915680,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/citation/,8p5cf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yc86d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/relationships/node/,yc86d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8481fe5f932f001ba3f88a/,5b8481fe5f932f001ba3f88a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8p5cf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8p5cf/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.002,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8p5cf

This article describes efforts undertaken by Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and partners (2007 to present) to convert abatement opportunities into carbon offsets with the aim of reducing GHGs in this sector and providing revenue to landowners. Analyses of emission-abating practices for rice, rangelands and almonds demonstrate that abatement costs are significant for most practices and are accompanied by high break-even carbon prices — often due to high transaction costs. Nonetheless, total abatement potential is shown to be large for certain activities. For this reason, and given the large series of opportunities not yet explored, a focal point of subsequent efforts should be to reduce transaction costs and barriers to entry.",TRUE,FALSE,AGRICULTURAL EMISSIONS|CARBON OFFSETS|CLIMATE POLICY|UNITED STATES,2018-08-28T00:31:24.483090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-28T00:28:22.139098,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/citation/,zea8g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xshcj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/relationships/node/,xshcj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b843457465d210016069119/,5b843457465d210016069119,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zea8g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zea8g/,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3699751,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zea8g

Recent technological advances have made it easy for archaeologists to rely on Geographic Information Systems’ least-cost path tools to identify the single easiest path to move between two points set in a realistically rugged landscape; however, least-cost path tools work on the assumption that the whole world is perfectly known, which does not represent human mobility accurately in all cases. Here, we present an agent-based least-cost path (AB-LCP) model, which does not make the assumption of complete landscape knowledge, and allows creating multiple anisotropic least-cost paths that take the traveler’s local perspective and incomplete knowledge into consideration. We demonstrate the model’s potential through a case study of the geographical distribution of Cantabrian (Spain) Lower Magdalenian engraved scapulae, which provides an interesting extension to current understanding of Magdalenian mobility, showcasing the flexibility and potential of this new LCP tool to study archaeological landscapes. The results of our study suggest that the studied engraved scapulae may have been created at El Castillo, and then brought to Altamira for transmission to other sites. The results show that El Castillo was strategically located on a bottleneck for coastal-to-plain mobility, whereas Altamira was located along social paths connecting other contemporaneous sites. This supports the already-accepted notion that both sites may have served for Upper Paleolithic population aggregation. However, our research builds on this idea by explaining why these two sites would have become so important. We suggest that Altamira was strategically placed near the boundary of inter-regional groups, thus taking the role as an aggregation site for unrelated populations, whereas El Castillo would have been used by the intra-regional group population to congregate during the summer and take advantage of the local mosaic of resources.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-based model|Altamira|El Castillo|El Cierro|Geographic Information System|Least-cost path|Lower Magdalenian|Mobility,2018-08-28T00:30:45.808202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-28T00:27:13.793097,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/citation/,ac2r6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f2ymj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/relationships/node/,f2ymj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b8432c1465d210018068a3b/,5b8432c1465d210018068a3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ac2r6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ac2r6/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2018.08.014,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ac2r6
