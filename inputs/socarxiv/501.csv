The ‘Enhanced School Health Initiative’ (ESHI) targeted 30 primary schools in southern Ethiopia and aimed to improve the health and educational outcomes of school children through an integrated package of school feeding, deworming and the provision of improved water sanitation and hygiene (WASH). This study investigated parental perceptions of this integrated school health and nutrition programme. 
Methods. The data was collected through group interviews with parents of children at schools targeted by the programme. Ten schools were purposively selected to represent geographical diversity. A team of two trained facilitators led the group interview in each school. All interviews were conducted in local dialects and then directly translated into English and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings are structured around key themes identified from the discussions.
Results and Discussion. Three main themes are identified from the interviews. The first relates to the perceptions of equity and opportunity generated for the children and the parents as a result of the programme. The second theme identifies the dissemination of learning throughout the community reported by parents. This includes the use of children as messengers, particularly for good hygiene practices and importance of deworming. The final theme explores concerns about ownership and sustainability of the programme within the communities. When probed on the topic of sustainability, parents raised conflicts surrounding ownership, and their ability to sustain the programme without further external input. 
Conclusions. The findings highlight the parent’s perceptions of this integrated school health and nutrition programme, and the multiple mechanisms through which it has an impact on the wider community. They also highlight what aspects of the programme are felt to be sustainable without further input, particularly behaviour change.",TRUE,FALSE,deworming|Focus Group Discussions|intestinal worms|Local perceptions|School Feeding|WASH,2019-01-08T20:04:02.714401,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-08T20:03:14.530131,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/citation/,s9ac7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ehfyr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/relationships/node/,ehfyr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c34dc528047080018f87d2a/,5c34dc528047080018f87d2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s9ac7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s9ac7,NA

We find that place based factors predicting whether homeless individuals are victimized or the offender being homeless are largely consistent with one another. Out of 26 different crime attractors and generators, prior drug arrests, homeless shelters, and bus stops are the three biggest factors in predicting homeless related crime. We show how the RTM model can effectively forecast future homeless related crimes as well. This suggests that targeted spatial strategies can reduce both homeless offending and victimization risk. Given that the majority of homeless individuals are only intermittently homeless, place based strategies may be a more an effective way to limit risk than strategies that focus on individuals.

This construct was articulated to support and strengthen doctoral education. This paper expands the construct of stewardship so that it can be applied to both scholars and non-academic practitioners, and can be initiated earlier than doctoral education. To accomplish this, we describe a general developmental trajectory supporting cross-curriculum teaching for stewardship of a discipline as well as of a profession. We argue that the most important features of stewardship, comprising the public trust for the future of their discipline or profession, are obtainable by all practitioners, and are not limited to those who have completed doctoral training. The developmental trajectory is a Mastery Rubric, which requires articulating the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be targeted with a curriculum; recognizable stages of performance of these KSAs; and performance level descriptors of each KSA at each stage. Concrete KSAs of stewardship that can be taught and practiced throughout the career (professional or scholarly) were derived directly from the original definition. We used the European guild structure’s stages of Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master for the trajectory, and through a consensus-based standard setting exercise, created performance level descriptors featuring development of Bloom’s taxonometric cognitive abilities for each KSA. Together, these create the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship (MR-S). The MR-S articulates how stewardly behaviour can be cultivated and documented for individuals in any disciplinary curriculum, whether research-intensive (preparing “scholars”) or professional (preparing members of a profession or more generally for the work force). We qualitatively assess the validity of the MR-S by examining its applicability to, and concordance with professional practice standards in three diverse disciplinary examples: 1) History; 2) Statistics and Data Science; and 3) Neurosciences. These domains differ dramatically in terms of content and methodologies, but students in each discipline could either continue on to doctoral training and scholarship, or utilize doctoral or pre-doctoral training in other professions. The MR-S is highly aligned with the practice standards of all three of these domains, suggesting that stewardship can be meaningfully cultivated and utilized by those working in or outside of academia. The MR-S can be used for curriculum development or revision in order to purposefully promote stewardship at all levels of higher education and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-08T03:29:26.910611,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-07T20:15:27.061470,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/citation/,vw7j5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/relationships/node/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3394fa7cf3f5001bb1d812/,5c3394fa7cf3f5001bb1d812,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vw7j5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vw7j5,NA

This has been done using longitudinal data on all schoolchildren in state schools in England, from the National Pupil Database. The results show that the effects of school autonomy on educational inclusion depend on schools’ previous performance and socio-economic composition.

In politics, business and academia, renewable energy is often framed as the key solution to the global climate challenge. We, however, argue that the concept of renewable energy is problematic and should be abandoned in favor of more unambiguous conceptualization.

Building on the theoretical literature on framing and based on document analysis, case examples and statistical data, we discuss how renewable energy is framed and has come to be a central energy policy concept and analyze how its use has affected the way energy policy is debated and conducted. We demonstrate the key problems the concept of renewable energy has in terms of sustainability, incoherence, policy impacts, bait-and-switch tactics and generally misleading nature. After analyzing these issues, we discuss alternative conceptualizations and present our model of categorizing energy production according to carbon content and combustion.

How short-term exposure to refugees influences attitudes and voting behavior in Hungary,"How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting and sentiment. We code exposure to refugees at the settlement level using news reports from state media, an independent online news site, and an online social media aggregator. Settlements through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee voting in a national referendum on resettlement in 2016. The effect, estimated between 1.7% and 3.6%, decreases sharply with distance from points of exposure. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition party Jobbik gained, while the governing right-wing Fidesz party lost votes in these settlements in subsequent parliamentary elections, suggesting incumbents are punished by voters in these settlements skeptical of immigration regardless of their policy position.

The subject has sparked interest within China to contribute to building a positive national image, while foreign analysts seek out ulterior motives, questioning the credibility of state-led soft power. This study will attempt to identify how China’s soft power is perceived and implemented by comparatively analyzing the extant data and literature on the subject. Through examining the various perceptions of soft power and how it is used by China, I aim to demonstrate that despite the myriad of research, soft power remains ambiguous in its embryonic stage and therefore should not be assessed without an aggregated measurement to operationalize soft power.",TRUE,FALSE,China soft power|Chinese Foreign Policy|Chinese soft power,2019-01-05T20:01:41.498792,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05T20:01:19.733420,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Ryan Avery,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/citation/,tuj6x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c310c138047080019f49e11/,5c310c138047080019f49e11,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuj6x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tuj6x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tuj6x,NA

Thus, an impactful digital community is flourishing within the country. It has been thought online community would be a sub-culture and mere clique. However, proving this surmise wrong, netizens constitute half of the country’s entire population in Bangladesh. As digital neighborhood is becoming larger as well as second-home to its users in Bangladesh, so the interaction and discourse is growing at an incredible pace. What we now call online is nothing but a reflection of offline except its physicality, where, like other real-life contents, religion has also been accommodated. Religion in cyberspace is dubbed as “cyber-religion”. Netizens perform virtual religious practices, express emotions regarding their religion, and participate in discussion. Debates on religion often leads to the intention of malice, and contending faiths transform peace into communal animosity. Thus, society get heated by hostile communal performances. In contemporary Bangladesh, “digital piety” as an exclusive phenomenon attained immense social significance.
