The low TFR has obviously negative impacts on quality of life of individuals as well as society as a whole, and it could lead to societal decline. Widening of a gap between early beginning of sexual activities and late reproduction start of individuals is a phenomenon specific to humans, not observed in apes, other mammals or other species. We believe that this gap significantly impacts the TFR, while not only economic but also social and cultural aspects like ethics, morals, and religions are important to reverse the low TFR. We contemplate social, moral and economic actions that could reduce this gap.

Shamanism also existed among nearly all documented hunter-gatherers, likely characterized the religious lives of many ancestral humans, and is often proposed by anthropologists to be the “first profession”, representing the first institutionalized division of labor beyond age and sex. This paper proposes a cultural evolutionary theory to explain why shamanism consistently develops, and in particular, (1) why shamanic traditions exhibit recurrent features around the world, (2) why shamanism professionalizes early, often in the absence of other specialization, and (3) how shifting social conditions affect the form or existence of shamanism. According to this theory, shamanism is a set of traditions developed through cultural evolution that adapts to people’s intuitions to convince observers that a practitioner can influence otherwise unpredictable, significant events. The shaman does this by ostensibly transforming during initiation and trance, violating folk-intuitions of humanness to assure group-members that he or she can interact with the invisible forces that control uncertain outcomes. Entry requirements for becoming a shaman persist because the practitioner’s credibility depends on them “transforming”. This contrasts with dealing with problems that have identifiable solutions (like building a canoe), where credibility hinges on showing results and outsiders can invade the jurisdiction by producing the outcome. Shamanism is an ancient human institution that recurs because of the capacity of cultural evolution to produce practices adapted to innate psychological tendencies.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|evolution|religion|shamanism|trance,2018-07-02T10:58:08.253699,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-16T00:27:19.492306,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/citation/,bemhx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dsmqg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/relationships/node/,dsmqg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591a461d594d90024dc2fc49/,591a461d594d90024dc2fc49,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bemhx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bemhx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bemhx,NA

A smaller literature has begun to examine the intergenerational impacts of in utero conditions.  A link between these two literatures—the impacts of in utero conditions on family formation—has had few examinations but offers a potential set of mechanisms for the intergenerational reach of early conditions.  This paper draws from the 1960 US Decennial Census to examine whether exposed individuals had different family formation patterns than adjacent unexposed cohorts.  The findings suggest small overall effects on marriage rates, number of children, and several measures of “type” of spouse for men, but moderate effects for women. The findings also show that exposed individuals have spouses with lower schooling than unexposed counterparts, this effect is particularly large for women, and it increases the likelihood of marrying spouses with very low levels of schooling.",TRUE,FALSE,1918 Influenza Pandemic|Family Formation|In Utero Exposure|Life Course Analysis,2018-07-02T10:58:08.109648,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-15T18:35:36.391655,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/citation/,bp7sv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c6xdp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/relationships/node/,c6xdp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5919f4939ad5a10251a72a6e/,5919f4939ad5a10251a72a6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bp7sv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bp7sv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bp7sv,NA

Reacting to critiques that the smart city is overly technocratic and instrumental, companies and cities have reframed their initiatives as ‘citizen-centric’. However, what ‘citizen-centric’ means in practice is rarely articulated. We draw on and extend Sherry Arnstein’s seminal work on participation in planning and renewal programmes to create the ‘Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation’ – a conceptual tool to unpack the diverse ways in which the smart city frames citizens. We then use this scaffold to measure smart citizen inclusion, participation, and empowerment in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland. Our analysis illustrates how most ‘citizen-centric’ smart city initiatives are rooted in stewardship, civic paternalism, and a neoliberal conception of citizenship that prioritizes consumption choice and individual autonomy within a framework of state and corporate defined constraints that prioritize market-led solutions to urban issues, rather than being grounded in civil, social and political rights and the common good. We conclude that significant normative work is required to rethink ‘smart citizens’ and ‘smart citizenship’ and to remake smart cities if they are to truly become ‘citizen-centric’.",TRUE,FALSE,citizens|citizenship|engagement|participation|rights|smart city,2018-07-02T10:58:07.682566,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-15T10:13:47.522686,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/citation/,v24jn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rjbnw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/relationships/node/,rjbnw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59197e9b9ad5a10250a6e15f/,59197e9b9ad5a10250a6e15f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v24jn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v24jn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v24jn,NA

However, there were stark differences in the trend for the non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white populations. In this paper we assess differences in opioid deaths by race. We analyze patterns and trends in multiple cause-of-death data to gain a better understanding of how deaths differ by race and what has contributed to changes over time. The trend in race-specific opioid death rates over 2000–2015 can be divided into two periods: 2000–2010 and 2010–2015. The increase in 2000–2010 was more substantial for the white population and was driven by prescription painkillers. Since 2010, the rates of opioid-mortality increase for both the white and black populations have been similar and largely due to heroin and fentanyl-type opioids. For the white population, death rates due to heroin and fentanyl-type drugs decrease with age, but for the black population, the opposite is true.

Based upon a queer feminist political economic critique and evidenced in my teaching critical GIS at two elite liberal arts colleges, I argue that “status quo” between ESRI and geography as a field must be interrupted. Extending a critical GIS focus beyond data structures and data ethics, I argue that geographic researchers and instructors have a responsibility in queering our choice and production of software, algorithms, and code alike. I call this production and choice of democratic, accessible, and useful software by, for, and about the needs of its users good enough software.

It is very difficult to understand the symbols on Stećak tombstones without the essential knowledge of the basic principles and philosophy of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, so even the most dedicated researchers of Bosnian Middle Ages observed Stečak symbols only as a decorative  motifs denying the tombstones' enormous amount of ""philosophical and spiritual content"" that greatly can help in the study of the religious character of the Bosnian Church in the Middle Ages. To understand the meaning of many symbols of alchemy and theurgy on Stećak tombstones, a researcher of Bosnian medieval spirituality has to relate himself with one world in which mystery and spirituality are central. For example alchemical imagination constantly reminds us that opposing forces in nature have to unite thus forming a special relationships in a way that through their unification the mysterious ""third"" occurs (Alchemical ""Egg"",""Philosopher's Stone"", ""Tree of Life"") that transcends an ordinary existence.",TRUE,FALSE,Alchemical Egg|alchemical symbols|Alchemy|Bosnian Church|gold and silver|Hermeticism|Lapis Philosophorum|Neoplatonism|Spirit and Soul|Stećci tombstones|sulphur and mercury|sun and moon|theurgy|Tree of Life,2018-07-02T10:58:06.966998,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-13T06:58:27.882645,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d21|Arts and Humanities|Medieval Studies,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/citation/,xn5k6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uca97/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/relationships/node/,uca97,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5916ad296c613b024c2775d2/,5916ad296c613b024c2775d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn5k6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xn5k6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xn5k6,NA

Plotinus believed that the teachings of Gnostics were horrible because hey apparently followed the teachings of Plato and had some compatible views on the origin and nature of the cosmos with Platonism, but ""Gnostic myth"" actually twisted Plato's original teachings, and ultimately turned against him. Neoplatonists had a generally cheerful and optimistic view of the world as opposed to the Gnostics who despised it. Evil does not exist, it is just a ""lack or deficit of Goodness"" according to Neoplatonism. The only source of evil for Neoplatonists is being in the state of distance from the One, as a result of turning to the excessive material pleasures downwards and not toward superior spiritual reality upwards. Augustine became Neoplatonist in indirect way, and we know that Neoplatonistic texts helped in his transition to Christianity. He used the Platonic writings to attack Manichaeism, a sect which he once belonged. He came across Neoplatonic works of Plotinus and Ambrose written in Latin that helped him to change his Manichaean way of thinking about good and evil. Augustine said that Manichaean God is not true God because He is vulnerable to evil, stating that a true God is omnipotent and can't be affected in any way. After Augustine encountered  Neoplatonic teachings he called Manichean teachings extremely simplified, pointing out that people are not found in every life situation torn between just two alternatives: good and evil, since people have multiple, complex and complicated desires and needs. According to Augustine we do not have two substances in us that are in war with each other, light and darkness, good and evil, but the problem is in our will that longs for a multitude of things that we want, of which only some are good. In this way he formulated his doctrine of good and evil influenced by  Neoplatonism which was completely different from the dualistic approach we find in Gnosticim and Manichaeism.",TRUE,FALSE,dualism|Gnosticism|Good and Evil|Goodness|Manichaeism|Neoplatonism|Plotinus|st.Augustine,2018-07-02T10:58:06.900952,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-13T06:33:10.573392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/citation/,krj2n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c37js/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/relationships/node/,c37js,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5916a761b83f69024c1aa66c/,5916a761b83f69024c1aa66c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/krj2n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/krj2n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/krj2n,NA

We find that social entrepreneurs often express a common motivation: an aspiration to integrate their religious beliefs and work.
