Questions formulated to achieve the purpose of the study focused on. (1) Determining the habits of mind suitable for EFL students. (2) Finding out differences in both English as a foreign language (EFL) students’ writing performance test regarding experimental and control group. (3) Finding out differences in both EFL students’ autonomy scale of experimental and control group. Thirty three EFL students constituted the sample for this study and four instruments-designed by the researchers- were used for data collection. Results indicated that students of experimental group outperformed their counterparts of the control group in EFL writing performance test and autonomy scale scores.

This paper investigates the integration of local knowledge into English language learning by examining the cultural content of the Your Language My Culture supplementary reading module and teachers and students’ acceptance of the module. Using a conceptual framework that incorporated types of culture, cultural senses and representation of cultural information, data were collected using a questionnaire, reflective blogs and evaluation checklists from 57 teachers from various schools in the state of Terengganu in Malaysia. Content and thematic analysis were carried out and the findings show that while local, target and international culture were represented, the emphasis was towards local culture. Most of the cultural information was represented in the form of visual illustrations and less in dialogue and video recordings with the aesthetic sense dominating in terms of cultural sense. It is recommended that types of representations like dialogues, recordings, written tasks, visuals, texts and realia be included to help students attain pragmatic skills to use the language.

This study is unique in the sense that there has been hardly any systematic investigation that has considered the professional identity of Pakistani EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia. This study has two considerations: the way EFL teachers' selves evolve and the personal, professional, social and pedagogical factors constructing a teacher’s professional identity. This study was conducted at the English Language Institute of Saudi Arabian University and the study employed a quantitative survey method. The quantitative data was collected from 41 Pakistani EFL teachers by using an online questionnaire. The findings from the research revealed that a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors develop the professional identity of Pakistani EFL teachers. Among these factors are the participants' pre-Saudi Arabia lives and the decision to become EFL teachers, the decision to come to Saudi Arabia, the impact of their overseas EFL experience, and the social influence on their own professional identity. Moreover, other factors that develop these teachers' professional identities are:  being non-native, their views on continuing professional development (CPD), interaction with other EFL teachers, and their professional futures.",TRUE,FALSE,constructing teaching selves|NNEST|Pakistani EFL teachers|professional identity|Saudi EFL context,2018-07-02T11:31:09.122161,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:28:01.680861,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/citation/,npxh3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/csjxy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/relationships/node/,csjxy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45a102b794960013afc2cc/,5a45a102b794960013afc2cc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/npxh3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/npxh3/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/npxh3

Among the well-known endeavors in this regard is the morphological annotation of the Quranic Arabic Corpus (QAC) which was carried out in Leeds University, UK. In addition, researchers in the University of Haifa had previously implemented a computational system for the morphological analysis of the Qur'an. More recently, a new Quranic corpus has been built in Mohammed I University in Morocco. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only three studies to produce a morphologically analyzed part-of-speech tagged Qur'an encoded as a structured linguistic database. This paper surveys the morphological analysis in the above-mentioned annotation projects and compares between them to test the quality of their analysis using five criteria related to display of the text in the corpus, word segmentation, morphological disambiguation, part of speech (POS) tag set and manual verification. The paper concludes that the QAC of Leeds and the Quranic corpus of Morocco surpass the Quranic corpus of Haifa with regard to most of these criteria. Furthermore, some additional POS tags for derivative nouns are suggested in a step to reach a more fine-grained tag set that could be proposed for POS tagging of Qur'anic Arabic.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic morphological analysis|Arabic POS tagging|corpus annotation|corpus linguistics|the Glorious Qur'an,2018-07-02T11:31:08.960453,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:29:27.408691,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/citation/,wgt9x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8jde7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/relationships/node/,8jde7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a459d76b794960013afc200/,5a459d76b794960013afc200,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wgt9x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wgt9x/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wgt9x

Its data were gathered within a two- month period using a pre-post-test design for equivalent groups. The researcher taught both groups deliberately using contrasting instructional approaches; the first were solely exposed to textbook content, excluding all visual aids throughout the process; whereas the second had authentic videos incorporated. As his work pressed ahead,  these methodological techniques  variably had a visible influence on the trainees' in-class interactivity, attentiveness, and keenness to grasp information.

While many quasi-experimental studies confirm efficacy and positive student attitudes towards these types of tools, little is known about existing teaching practices that utilize messaging tools in tertiary contexts, or the attitudes of students or instructors towards them. This qualitative study investigates the use of WhatsApp, one popular messaging application, in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) through examining the attitudes of Preparatory Year students and faculty members at a university in the central-north of Saudi Arabia. Thematic analysis of focus group interviews indicated that WhatsApp is used in EFL instruction for information exchange, language learning support, and language practice. This is achieved through teacher-directed learning, peer learning, and autonomous learning instructional strategies. Thematic analysis also identified the affordances and affective outcomes of using WhatsApp. Student and faculty attitudes towards WhatsApp were positive although some faculty members expressed reservations towards its use. It is argued that applications such as WhatsApp should be leveraged to encourage autonomous and peer learning, repositioning instructors as facilitators, and to develop learning communities. However, increasing the informal, anywhere-anytime learning supported by mobile learning must be tempered with guidelines for students regarding faculty contact hours and response times to allay faculty fears and encourage greater student autonomy.",TRUE,FALSE,application|attitudes|EFL Saudi students|mobile learning|WhatsApp,2018-07-02T11:31:08.869112,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:30:10.179673,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/citation/,gux3h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wmuer/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/relationships/node/,wmuer,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a459af667d19e000d6c6589/,5a459af667d19e000d6c6589,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gux3h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gux3h/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gux3h

It is questioning why Sudanese tertiary students are unable to express themselves efficiently and comfortably. This seems crucial and imperative for a college student and it shouldn’t shape any obstacle as a prerequisite for future development. Accordingly, this paper poses a significant issue that every learner of English needs to ponder. To collect data for the study, three tools has been used; a questionnaire, an interview and an observational checklist. The questionnaire was distributed throughout the students of second, third and fourth year university students who had been selected from different Sudanese universities. The collected data is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Data analysis has shown that dialogic teaching enables students to develop the skills of argumentation, questioning and debate which contribute to the development of their critical thinking and speaking skills. Generally, the findings indicate that authentic dialogic teaching components are effective if students are given enough time to practice its skills. Hence recommendations for exposing learners to a variety of medium of speaking like dialogues, debate, argumentation and questioning are made to facilitate teachers to be more well-informed with dialogic teaching approach.",TRUE,FALSE,dialogic teaching|English language learners|speaking skill critical thinking skills,2018-07-02T11:31:08.823439,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:30:36.370366,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/citation/,d6euf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s25q7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/relationships/node/,s25q7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4599aeb794960012aff295/,5a4599aeb794960012aff295,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6euf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d6euf/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d6euf

Beauchamp and Thomas (2009) point out that examining new teacher identity can be considered as an important step to develop more effective teacher training programmes and identity development of a teacher is related to understanding the notion of ‘self’. This study investigates the possible selves of pre-service EFL teachers in relation to the concept of developing new teacher identity. Aim of the study is to measure possible selves of new teachers that they expect to become and/or fear becoming in the near feature.  In order to achieve this goal, ‘New Teacher Possible Selves Questionnaire’ (Hamman, Wang &amp; Burley, 2013; Dalioğlu &amp; Adıgüzel, 2015) was used to measure EFL teacher candidates’ expected and feared teacher possible-selves. A six-point Likert type scale of questionnaire on possible selves was applied to 149 pre-service EFL teachers from two universities. Results indicate that EFL teacher candidates have positive expectations and no certain fears for their first year of teaching, especially female teacher candidates who have higher scores than males in terms of expected possible-selves.",TRUE,FALSE,New teacher identity|Possible-selves theory|Pre-service EFL teachers,2018-07-02T11:31:08.785497,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:30:53.999950,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/citation/,w5htc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dkfj7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/relationships/node/,dkfj7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4598c7b794960010b05e03/,5a4598c7b794960010b05e03,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5htc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w5htc/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w5htc
