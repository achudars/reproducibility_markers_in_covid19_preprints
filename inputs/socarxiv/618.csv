Yet SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) registration schemes are threatening to throttle the technology’s developmental potential. These mandates, which require the registration of identity information to activate a mobile SIM card, are fast becoming universal in Africa, with little to no public debate about the wider social or political effects. Whereas some authors have explored the motivations behind these drives, as well as their potential economic impacts, this paper focuses its critique on the broader diversity of implications of this regulatory transformation.

Latour’s approach to constructivism and translation, his analytical commitment to ‘keeping the social flat’, and his distribution of agency offer novel ways of maintaining some of the strengths of post-development without falling prey to some of its weaknesses.

Nearly 19 million social welfare beneficiaries enrolled in a novel biometric identification scheme that uses fingerprints and voice recognition to authenticate social grant recipients. This article seeks to understand the meaning of biometric technology in post-apartheid South African welfare through a study of the bureaucratic and policy elite's motivation. It argues that biometric technology was conceived of and implemented as the most recent in a series of institutional, infrastructural and policy reforms that seek to deliver welfare in a standardised and objective manner.

Yet despite major shifts in both medical education and in medicine writ-large, medical sociologists' focus on emotions has largely disappeared. In this paper, we argue that due to recent radical transformations in the medical arena, emotional socialization within medical education should be of renewed interest for sociologists. Developments in medical education such as increased diversity among enrollees, the rise of patient health movements, and curricular transformation have made this context a particularly interesting case for sociologists working on a variety of questions related to structural, organizational, and cultural change. We offer three areas of debate within studies in medical education that sociologists may be interested in studying: 1) gendered and racialized differences in the performance of clinical skills related to emotion, 2) differences in self-reported empathy among subspecialties, and 3) loss of empathy during the third year or clinical year of medical school.",TRUE,FALSE,Biomedicine|Emotion|Emotional Socialization|Medical education|Professional socialization,2018-07-02T11:03:29.388556,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-15T00:08:07.577753,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/citation/,3wcr2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/69hnw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/relationships/node/,69hnw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59695bc0594d90022bee067a/,59695bc0594d90022bee067a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3wcr2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3wcr2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.05.027

Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture. We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers. We find that the program had substantial impacts on plantain revenue and production, while achieving nearly complete irrigation coverage of plantain land among beneficiaries.

How oralce-bone inscriptions had been created? and who created it? Those questions have been debated more than one hundred years. Proto-cuneiform is the earliest form of the cuneiform script, the earliest writing system attested in history. It emerged towards the end of the fourth millennium B.C. in ancient a region of Mesopotamia of West Asia. By comparing Sumerian proto-cuineform vs oracle-bone inscription, there are some common basic symbols could be found in both inscriptions. Those symbols had same or derivative meaning in both side. There are a lot of such symbols have been found in both side, they existed in both side simultaneously. It are sufficient and logically. Those evidences indicate that oracle-bone inscription could ascend to proto-cuineform and oracle-bone inscription did not origin in China . At same time the common basic symbol of both inscription could be used to re-explanation of the oracle-bone and help to understand the its real means.",TRUE,FALSE,china history|ealy China|Oracle-bone inscription； Proto-cuineform； Sumerian；Original of the Oracle-bone inscriptions|Shang Dynasty,2018-07-02T11:03:28.450616,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-13T03:04:48.125210,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/citation/,5yjuq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ypez2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/relationships/node/,ypez2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5966e0aa9ad5a1022c9d4e85/,5966e0aa9ad5a1022c9d4e85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yjuq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5yjuq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5yjuq,NA

Legal scholars have long recognized the influence of the New York lawyer David Dudley Field on American legal codification, but tracing the influence of Field’s code of civil procedure with precision across some 30,000 pages of statutes is a daunting task. By adapting methods of digital text analysis to observe text reuse in legal sources, this article provides a methodological guide to show how the evolution of law can be studied at a macro level—across many codes and jurisdictions—and at a micro level—regulation by regulation. Applying these techniques to the Field Code and its emulators, we show that by a combination of creditors’ remedies the code exchanged the rhythms of agriculture for those of merchant capitalism. Archival research confirmed that the spread of the Field Code united the American South and American West in one Greater Reconstruction. Instead of just a national political development centered in Washington, we show that Reconstruction was also a state-level legal development centered on a procedure code from the Empire State of finance capitalism.",TRUE,FALSE,codes of civil procedure|digital history|federalism|history of capitalism|legal history|text analysis,2018-07-02T11:03:28.358022,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-12T20:53:21.366861,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c72|Law|Civil Procedure|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cce|Arts and Humanities|History|United States History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdf|Arts and Humanities|History|Legal,Kellen Funk and Lincoln Mullen,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/citation/,w8un4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xup2h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/relationships/node/,xup2h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596688e26c613b00446ff69e/,596688e26c613b00446ff69e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8un4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8un4,https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/123.1.132
