Seven (7) participants were gathered as co-researchers and were selected thoroughly based on the following criteria: 1) They are Filipino who had stroke at the age of 15-35 and 2) They are able and willing to articulate, participate, and share their life experiences. 
	Further, the experiences of the participants were gathered and enhanced through the following methods: 1) Interview, and 2) Storytelling. Subsequently, three levels of analysis were done ensuing the process developed by Martinez (2013), grounded on interpretative phenomenology. Through the process of reflective analysis, three themes have emerged and are as follows: 
(a) “Sometimes, what is forbidden is pleasurable”: Dilemma of Needs and Wants
(b) “I accepted it... my family is still accepting it”: Centrality and Ambiguity of the Family
(c) “I become feeble but stronger”: Resilience in Vulnerability

	The themes represent a recurring pattern among the lives of the co-researchers from having the desire to change their old ways and habits but acting otherwise. Further, these patterns are reflected in the positionality of their family as both a burden that reminds them that they have a disease yet serves as the main reason they continue to fight. This also mirrors how they view stroke as something that defeated them but in the process taught them resilience in life. The insight of a “life in paradox”, then serves as the central essence of the study.
	Insights from the study suggest that the experience of the co-researchers is more than an individual experience of conflict resolution but a phenomenon of family’s contextualization.

Given this context, it is interesting to note that few research have been done on the experiences of these individuals who provide care to their dying relatives.
     This research aims to understand the lives of these informal carers as they provide care to their dying relatives. After securing clearance from an IRB, seven (5) informants, deemed as coresearchers, were recruited and agreed to participate in this study. The co-researchers where selected based on a pre-set criteria and the number were reached based on theoretical saturation. Multiple individual in-depth face-to-face interviews were done to create the individual narratives which was later reflectively analysed. Interpretive phenomenology as espoused by van Manen served as the philosophical underpinning of the study. Consequently, the proposed analytic technique of van Manen was utilized as the process of reflective analysis.
     After the process of reflective analysis, three (3) themes were gathered, namely: Ambivalence in anticipation, Courage in uncertainty, Meaning in suffering. These themes represent for the co-researchers their lives as they care for their dying relatives. Further, these themes reflects for the co-researchers a phenomenon of living moment-to-moment, unsure of what tomorrow will bring, patiently waiting for their relative to cross over. For them, there seems to be a constant struggle of finding a reason for being and a sense of what has happened, what is happening and what could happen to their dying relative and their family after their death. This essence can be symbolically represented by a swinging pendulum, constantly in motion trying to situate ambivalence in their anticipation, looking for courage amidst uncertainty and finding for
meaning in their experience of suffering.
     The insights suggest that there is a need for constant dialogue among family members and health care providers as they assumed the role of primary caregivers. Further continued emotional, moral and spiritual support is implied during this transition as well as follow-ups when the families are at the home setting.",TRUE,FALSE,caregiver|caring|death|dying|family member|phenomenology,2019-10-08T16:44:21.613921,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-08T16:44:07.809907,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/citation/,tqzp6,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c3af4a7bc73000be6b545/,5d9c3af4a7bc73000be6b545,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqzp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqzp6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqzp6

Grounded on focused ethnography, seven (7) informants from two stroke unit from two selected hospitals within Metro Manila were chosen to be informants in this study. Participants were selected based on the criteria that (1) They are currently working as nurses in the stroke unit with at least five years of exposure in the said area and (2) they are fluent in English and Tagalog and are willing to participate in this study. Interviews and story-telling sessions were done to gather the necessary narratives which was then analyzed via the process of thematization. 
After the process of analysis, three themes were identified and are as follows: (1) Technical proficiency as a sign of competence; (2) Perceived autonomy as a mark of dignity; (3) Relational expertise as a manifestation of seniority. The themes show in general how technical competence, perceived autonomy and relational expertise were seen by the informants as distinctive marks of their professional identity as nurses working in a stroke units.  
Insights from this study reveal the unique appreciation of nurses working in stroke unit of their concept of competence, autonomy and expertise. The said concepts are deeply ingrained in their everyday lives that it has become part of their disciplinary hallmarks.

Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level) to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling approach bridges a significant gap in the availability of migration data at administrative unit levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded.

However, it is yet unclear how these two types of knowledge contribute to making predictions about other people’s choice behavior. To fill this gap, we had participants learn probabilistic preferences by predicting object choices of agents that either belonged to a social group (Group condition) or not (Individual condition). We quantified how close predictions for a specific agent are relative to the objective individual preferences of that agent and how close these predictions are relative to the objective group-level preferences to which that agent belongs. As expected, we found that participants’ predictions in the Group condition, relative to the Individual condition, were more similar to the group-level preference, while less similar to the individual-level preferences.

But within archaeological discourse, these practices have been neglected by the community of archaeologists.

Magic and Medicine were intertwined in ancient civilization and are acutely embedded in folk healing culture currently. The Indigenous Knowledge (IK) of healing as cultural intangible heritage have been widely discussed by anthropologists, historians and fictional novelists. But within archaeological discourse, these practices have been neglected by the community of archaeologists. Here, the focus has been placed to the ethnoarchaeological investigation of the Black Magic (BM) practices of Mayong, Assam through the re-elucidation of its the material culture and symbolism used during Magico-Medicinal Practices (MMPs) or Magical Practices (MPs). Whereas, the fundamental objective is to critically review the existing archaeological as well as a socio-cultural approach to IK of Magico-Medicinal healing, in which  MMPs and MPs have been diminished to the extent of social exclusion.",NA,NA,,NA,2019-10-06T12:25:54.225494,,TRUE,withdrawn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities,I want to withdraw this version and upload a pdf version,Rakesh Kumar,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z57pe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z57pe/bibliographic_contributors/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z57pe/review_actions/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z57pe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z57pe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z57pe

It is commonly believed that Monte-Carlo simulation is the only viable method available for the LIBOR Market Model. In this article, however, we propose a lattice approach to price interest rate products within the LIBOR Market Model by introducing a shifted forward measure and several novel fast drift approximation methods. This model should achieve the best performance without losing much accuracy. Moreover, the calibration is almost automatic and it is simple and easy to implement. Adding this model to the valuation toolkit is actually quite useful; especially for risk management or in the case there is a need for a quick turnaround.",TRUE,FALSE,asset pricing|callable bond|derivatives valuation|lattice approach|LIBOR Market Model|risk management,2019-10-06T04:04:22.968660,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-06T04:04:04.731815,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/citation/,qmh9c,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d98f165ffd249000e730a76/,5d98f165ffd249000e730a76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qmh9c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qmh9c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qmh9c
