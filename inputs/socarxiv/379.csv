Due to this, many PSETs often choose to use traditional teaching methods in the classroom which can have counteractive effects on their math anxiety (Harper &amp; Daane, 1998; Olson &amp; Stoehr, 2019; Tooke &amp; Lindstrom, 1998). The goal of this paper is to better comprehend and discover the ways in which math anxiety in PSETs impacts their teaching and whether there are ways to limit these negative emotions about mathematics. Much of the research on this topic look at either PSETs’ beliefs/views or their teaching practices. The focus of this paper will be to analyze the relationship between their beliefs/views and their teaching such to look at how one influences the other or if they have a symbiotic relationship as well as looking at how one’s individual psychology influences these beliefs/views. Using a symbolic interactionist lens, the arguments provide evidence from the literature that looks at the relationships between people and others. Moreover, in touching upon these relationships, this paper also delves into gender issues and stereotypes that have influenced these relationships. The implications of this paper deal primarily with the impact of gender stereotypes on teaching and anxiety as well as what teaching practices are most favourable when looking at reducing anxiety levels in PSETs.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-04-25T18:40:22.401993,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-25T18:40:10.902981,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/citation/,536qg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc0f890fad565001806ffe1/,5cc0f890fad565001806ffe1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/536qg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/536qg,NA

Casamançais multilingual practices,"This paper enquires into the role of multilingual practices in conviviality in shared, socially and culturally mixed localities. I ask how Casamançais use diverse repertoires to get by in everyday life in both Casamance, Senegal and Catalonia, Spain. The concept of conviviality stresses fragile, dynamic processes characteristic of everyday ways of living together with maintained difference. I argue that minimal, but diversified language practices, which compose linguistically diverse repertoires, are central in facilitating conviviality among local residents. Minimal interactions and ‘small talk’, or phatic communion, cushion potentially conflictual socio-cultural differences and inequalities. Firstly, I will evaluate discourses on multilingual practices of Casamançais in both contexts. Second, I will critically explore the reasons for and quality of the widespread use of diverse repertoires. I conclude that multilingual practices facilitate phatic communion sometimes playfully and sometimes as part of coping strategies in situations in which structural forces determine which choices will be more successful than others. The process of conviviality spans both these aspects describing ever-dynamic and ever-fragile ways of living with difference.",TRUE,FALSE,Casamance|Catalonia|conviviality|difference|inequality|minimal interaction|multilingualism|phatic communion|polylanguaging,2019-04-24T13:18:10.412958,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-24T13:17:42.027412,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/citation/,pnv5h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc02c59d9de11001d80f655/,5cc02c59d9de11001d80f655,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pnv5h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pnv5h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pnv5h,https://doi.org/10.14426/mm.v2i1.58

Most empirical and all experimental sciences require some form of data analysis, including qualitative methods. However, even those in degree or formal educational programs learning about statistics/biostatistics/data science do not receive training in what constitutes “ethical practice”. The American Statistical Association (ASA) maintains, and recently (2018) updated, Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice. Understanding and being able to utilize these Guidelines (GLs) is relevant for all applications of statistical and data science methodologies – whether for true “research” (following the scientific method) or for business or other predictive/decision-making support. Thus, students who will go on to be statisticians and non-statisticians alike need to learn about ethical statistical practice, including those who seek to apply these methods in marketing, policy, and higher education. This article describes how to employ the case study method to teach the ASA GLs, using simple vignettes and a specific tool called a “stakeholder analysis template”. The template is introduced as a method for understanding the harms and benefits, as well as the stakeholders, in each of a series of tasks common to the collection, analysis/manipulation, and drawing of inferences or conclusions based on data in any shape or size. The ASA Ethical Guidelines are discussed with respect to their potential to guide data collection and munging (two specific tasks), with three learning objectives: 1. describe how different individuals (“stakeholders”) may be affected by decisions and actions; 2. enumerate harms and benefits that are most clearly relevant for each stakeholder with respect to the activity; and 3. identify which ASA GL Principles (and/or specific elements) seem most relevant to this activity.

The concept will be defined, particularly with respect to what about stewardship can be demonstrated by the practitioner so that others – including other stewards – can recognize this professional identity. Stewardship is an important aspect of professionalism, and although data science is a very new profession, its growth in terms of the number of practitioners should also include growth in the commitment to integrity in practice. Although an undergraduate program may seem early to begin understanding what this commitment means, and how to generate evidence of that commitment for yourself, those with a strong understanding of stewardship and how to recognize it will be better able to select jobs in contexts where this commitment to integrity is nurtured and valued. Learning about stewardship engages students in taking responsibility for their role in the profession, and so taking responsibility for the profession and the professional community.

We study the diverse sample of immigrants in the European Social Survey and use the fact that, due to country differences in educational distributions, a given education level can entail a very different rank in the sending and receiving countries.

Children from minority ethnic groups are, on average, 17% less likely to be admitted into their top-ranked secondary school, compared to white children. This gap is large even after controlling for socio-economic status and prior attainment. However, constraints on the length of preference lists mean that stated preferences may not be truthful, as parents may have incentives to strategise by excluding preferred schools. By accounting for strategic stated preferences and biased beliefs about chances of admission, this paper recovers parametric estimates of preference parameters and the degree of strategic selection. To examine the relative contribution of geographic sorting, strategies, and market design (mechanism and admission rules), the corrected revealed preference estimates are used to estimate expected welfare under three scenarios. The analysis reveals that both underlying preferences and strategising behaviour exhibit substantial heterogeneity by ethnicity, income and ability. When comparing welfare, I find that differences in admissions priority between white and minority ethnic families create small but significant and consistent differences in welfare. However, larger welfare differences are due to differences in preferences and strategy between the two groups.",TRUE,FALSE,manipulable mechanism|preference estimation|school admissions|school choice,2019-04-23T20:45:01.302869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23T20:44:45.111145,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/citation/,bj6gr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf2cb0d9de1100207eff30/,5cbf2cb0d9de1100207eff30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bj6gr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bj6gr,NA

By appealing to intended parents to come to the United States as a means to “select” traits in their future offspring by way of egg donation, American fertility industry practices may serve to undermine officially sanctioned norms and values regarding eugenics and selection in those intended parents’ own countries.",TRUE,FALSE,assisted reproductive technologies|egg donation|eugenics|fertility industry|reproductive tourism|selective reproduction|third-party reproduction,2019-04-23T20:46:46.833724,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23T20:46:32.850889,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",Lauren Jade Martin,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/citation/,kznvh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf2a03d9de11001d7f8a06/,5cbf2a03d9de11001d7f8a06,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kznvh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kznvh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kznvh,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58220-7_7

The experiment also varies the overlap between social identity and resources. The results show that both heterogeneity in social identities and inequality in resources reduce cooperation. When social identity and unequal resources are crossed orthogonally, the existence of composite group memberships mitigates the negative effects of inequality, but not of heterogeneity in social identities. When social identity and unequal resources overlap, cooperation decreases substantially among the participants with low resources, in both ingroup and outgroup interactions.  My results also show that participants who are assigned to advantaged roles cooperate significantly less than those who are assigned to disadvantaged roles.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|crosscutting circles|heterogeneity|inequality|social dilemmas,2019-04-24T13:17:33.084986,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-24T13:17:00.952524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/citation/,ah3g2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wkts8/,wkts8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf177ed9de11001f7f0c6b/,5cbf177ed9de11001f7f0c6b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ah3g2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ah3g2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ah3g2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2019.04.009

Nearly three decades ago, the Austrian government deployed special accommodations to handle a similarly sized influx of refugees entering Europe, individuals and families who were fleeing ethnic cleansing from the Bosnian War. These accommodations, and their eventual economic integration components, provide longitudinal data that indicates a system that allowed employment rates of Bosnian refugees to match the rate of host country populations within a generation. 
Through thematic analysis of an extensive literature review and field consultations in Vienna, this research will investigate what lessons the global community can learn from Austria’s treatment of Bosnians refugees, and whether these lessons can contribute to improved procedures for integrating refugees into host societies. Preliminary results indicate the role of social capital, civil society, and religion as factors of labor market integration, while also acknowledging rates of underemployment and stagnation in the asylum process as deterrents to positive relationship formation between host societies and refugee populations. The culmination of this year-long project will be a series of recommendations on how local and national actors can enact services that will benefit the longer-term goals of both refugee populations and host societies.",TRUE,FALSE,Labor market|Migration policy|Refugee integration|Refugees,2019-04-23T10:25:41.683884,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23T10:25:16.426048,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/citation/,sda9u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbdfd7cf2be3c0018072363/,5cbdfd7cf2be3c0018072363,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sda9u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sda9u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sda9u,NA

The rise of the Women’s March as a massive effort to mobilize women primarily on the basis of gender coincided with calls for it to pay greater attention to intersectionality. This study considers the effectiveness of the Women’s March at using intersectional activism as a collective action frame. Drawing on surveys conducted at Women’s March events in five cities and four other Washington, DC activist events in 2018, this study examines the extent to which activists think that the movements should place a priority on intersectional activism. The results show that participants in Women’s March events were more supportive of prioritizing intersectional activism than were activists at comparable protest events that were not mobilized using intersectional collective action frames. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that ideology may be a barrier to embracing intersectional activism, with more moderate and conservative activists placing a lower priority on intersectionality than did more liberal activists. Women’s March activists were more likely to prioritize intersectional activism if they were trans- or LGBTQIA+-identified, or if they had a history of backing intersectionally marginalized causes, than if they did not.",TRUE,FALSE,activism|collective action|grassroots|Intersectionality|social movements|Women's March,2019-04-22T02:59:42.440152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-22T02:59:29.693541,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/citation/,sdxvz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbcf9f8a3bc970019f50180/,5cbcf9f8a3bc970019f50180,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sdxvz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sdxvz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sdxvz,NA
