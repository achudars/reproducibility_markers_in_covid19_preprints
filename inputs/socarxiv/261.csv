Each user has the capacity to potentially reach others, and in this way, social media challenges the traditional distribution of content through mass media. The advertising industry has had to adapt to this new ecosystem and develop audiovisual pieces specifically tailored to this environment as part of their communication strategies. These pieces aim at achieving not only views but to engage viewers in sharing content with their contacts. Recent research indicates that there are certain aspects of human behaviour related to emotions and motivations that have an impact on the decision to share information, news and content with others. However, there are few studies analysing how the features of the content shared influence that decision. This article presents the content analysis results of the 100 most widely shared advertising viral videos around the world from 2011 to 2015 according to Adweek. The analysis was conducted from an emotional perspective in order to establish the common features of the most shared videos and to identify the frequency in which emotional narrative resources are used.",TRUE,FALSE,advertising|content analysis|emotions|social media|viral video,2020-01-28T21:33:26.971918,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-28T17:40:14.623198,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e10|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Public Relations and Advertising|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/citation/,nwmqg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2ec35b87a1d9020b1ce746/,5e2ec35b87a1d9020b1ce746,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nwmqg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nwmqg/,https://doi.org/10.15581/003.33.1.107-120,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nwmqg

Evidence from a case study on the individual and collective adaptation of British Sociologists.,"According to the Academic Capitalism-approach, research assessments have a negative impact on research autonomy and research diversity. They urge scholars to tailor their research in order to obtain funding and positive evaluations, which are indispensable for career advancement based on a limited set of quality-criteria. This is supposed to reduce the potential to understand phenomena and to diminish research diversity by nudging scholars to tailor their research towards short-termed, applied research. Our paper seeks to analyse the impact of research assessments on research autonomy, research diversity and the adaptation of scholars to quality criteria imposed by assessments. To do so, we focus on the impact of the British Research Excellence Framework (REF) on British sociology. In line with the Academic Capitalism-approach and Habitus-Fieldtheory, we suggest that the Research Excellence Framework exerts symbolic power and symbolic dominance on scholars. This affects both habitus and working conditions of scholars. To analyse the impact of the REF, a convergent parallel mixed methods-design is applied. On the individual level, we analysed interview data of six British sociologists. On the collective level, we analysed abstracts of 2546 REF submissions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our qualitative findings show that sociologists adapt by “focusing on mainstream topics” and apply strategies of “publication management”. Furthermore, “research profile development” and “recruitment of REFable” scholars is forced by the university management. The LDA uncovers a collective focus on a limited number of research foci including youth sociology, medical sociology, gender studies, or political sociology. The Jensen-Shannon divergence indicates research specialisation within universities, but low research diversity between universities. Taken together, the symbolic power and symbolic dominance of the REF urge scholars to use gaming the system strategies mirrored by low research diversity and high research specialisation on the collective level.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Capitalism|Habitus-Fieldtheory|Latent Dirichlet Allocation|Mixed Methods|Narrative Interviews|Natural Language Processing|Research Excellence Framework|Sociology of Sociology|Symbolic Dominance|Symbolic Power|Topic Modeling,2020-01-27T17:38:03.525542,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-27T17:37:41.751231,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/citation/,wda3j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2eb8c0c19c5d0209ee001e/,5e2eb8c0c19c5d0209ee001e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wda3j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wda3j/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wda3j

online distance learning courses. Although recording on-campus lectures for on-
campus students is increasingly common, there has been little scrutiny of the role
of lecture capture in online courses. We address this gap by exploring online
distance learning students’ perceptions of two types of recorded media; video-to-
camera lectures and lecture captures through the lens of the Community of
Inquiry (COI) Framework. The study concluded that lecture captures do not
contribute to the creation of a COI as they do not substantially increase cognitive,
social or teaching presence. However, students were enthusiastic about lecture
captures due to the naturalistic lecturing style and the opportunity to learn
vicariously. We suggest that these findings should prompt greater consideration
of the role of vicarious learning in online education and the tendency to perceive
campus-based education as being more ‘authentic’.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-31T08:34:25.635211,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-31T08:34:06.712624,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5e|Education|Higher Education|Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/citation/,wy9da,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g2rky/,g2rky,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2dce9887a1d9018d1ce6c9/,5e2dce9887a1d9018d1ce6c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wy9da/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wy9da/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wy9da

While their purpose and form varies greatly, they all rely on the discretion of a professionalised bureaucracy to manage these processes and prepare their outcomes in a manner that they can feed into policy-making. Bureaucrats thus have a gate-keeping role. They can substantially influence whether and how information from participatory processes feeds into policy-making. Bureaucrats can thereby impact to what extent participatory mechanisms can deliver on their promise of giving citizens greater direct control over the policy-making process. Formal political control over the bureaucracy is limited in this case. Could informal controls make bureaucrats comply more with the demands of participatory mechanisms? This study employs a large field experiment (N=7,532) to test (1) whether citizen input filters through to bureaucrats tasked with policy design and implementation and (2) whether bureaucrats’ engagement with citizen input can be in- creased by using non-monetary rewards and value-based communication. The experiment accounts for heterogeneity by bureaucrat seniority, central versus street-level roles and involvement in the collection of citizen input. It finds no meaningful engagement at the baseline (C=0%) but that motivational interventions can significantly increase engagement (T1= 14%, T2=15%). The findings suggest that currently little input from citizens filters through to bureaucrats, but small tweaks substantially increase the democratic potential of participatory initiatives.",TRUE,FALSE,bureaucrat|field experiment|gate-keeping|participation|responsiveness,2020-01-26T19:12:45.683444,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-26T19:12:18.745949,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,Annabelle S.

However, this form of stigma, termed weight stigma by association, is poorly understood.

Objective: To investigate the sources, forms, and impacts of weight stigma by association among mothers of children with overweight or obesity. 

Methods: Mothers of 5 to 16-year-old children (N=34; 54% non-Hispanic White) participated in semi-structured interviews. A coding scheme was developed using the constant comparative method and reliably applied to interview transcripts. Mothers’ self-reported sociodemographic information, and height and weight were measured.

Results: Family members were a common source of negative comments to parents about children’s weight; these comments were often critical of mothers’ parenting and caused hurt feelings and family estrangement. Many mothers also reported negative feelings about their children’s physicians due to interactions about their children’s weight. Almost all mothers expressed guilt and sadness for not parenting differently; many internalized beliefs that they were bad parents because of their children’s weight. 

Conclusion: Mothers of children with overweight and obesity are frequently the target of weight stigma by association.

This literature has argued that high schools are an important determinant of college attendance, with some contending that high schools matter more for college attendance than for academic achievement. A separate branch of research has illustrated how place-based opportunities facilitate college attendance. We merge these two literatures by asking if schools’ geographic context can explain apparent variation in effectiveness among Wisconsin high schools. We find that geographic context explains nearly a third of the variance in traditional estimates of school effectiveness on college attendance, because factors like proximity to colleges are strongly associated with college attendance. Accounting for geography is therefore important in order not to overstate high schools’ role in higher education outcomes. In contrast, geographic context explains little of the variance in academic achievement growth. Thus, if high schools seem to matter more for college attendance than for academic achievement under traditional estimates, schools’ apparent importance for the two outcomes converge upon adjusting for differences in geographic context.

Reanalyzing Bor et al. (2018)”","Nix and Lozada (2020) provide a critique of our 2018 paper, “Police killings and their spillover effects on the mental health of black Americans: a population-based, quasi-experimental study.” They take issue to our use of crowdsourced data from the Mapping Police Violence project database on whether or not a given victim was unarmed, our main exposure measure, and argue that 93 cases were miscoded as unarmed in these data. They then argue that recoding or dropping these 30% cases led to an attenuated and statistically non-significant estimate of the effect of these events on mental health outcomes among black American adults. In this reply, we argue that (1) our use of the Mapping Police Violence project data was carefully considered and scientifically valid both from a theoretical and analytic perspective, and (2) that the difference between our estimates and Nix and Lozada’s do not arise from “miscoding” as the authors claim, but rather a different definition of what constitutes an unarmed victim. To probe the robustness of our results, we estimate 128 regressions models representing all combinations of exclusions of the seven classes of events Nix and Lozada dispute as being unarmed. The estimates are uniformly positive (i.e., all indicative of a harmful relationship between exposure to these events at the state-level and mental health outcomes), and the range of estimates overlap substantially with the 95% confidence interval for our original point estimate.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-24T16:18:22.633584,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T16:17:14.911847,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/citation/,h6y5w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2af9f087a1d900e81ce0db/,5e2af9f087a1d900e81ce0db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6y5w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h6y5w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h6y5w

However, participation rates typically are low and disadvantaged groups under-represented. A large body of evidence shows that communication campaigns can increase participation in elections. However, the evidence base for non-electoral participation is scarce and in many aspects completely lacking. 
This study contributes to the literature by theorising and empirically testing whether such inequalities can be redressed. It uses a randomised field experiment with 29,008 households in a large city in the UK to test the effect of different direct mail messages on participation.  It illustrates that rigorous testing of interventions is necessary to understand their impact across different democratic contexts: Contrary to what theory would predict for electoral contexts and paid-for work, all tested interventions significantly decrease participation in the governance initiative under study.",TRUE,FALSE,behaviour|field experiment|get out the vote|participation,2020-01-24T12:09:01.275458,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T12:08:51.209045,NA,NA,no,the data will be made publicly available once the manuscript has been accepted for publication,,available,NA,http://osf.io/8geb3/,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/citation/,we6vb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n7s5e/,n7s5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2ad878c19c5d00ddedf5d8/,5e2ad878c19c5d00ddedf5d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we6vb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/we6vb/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/we6vb
