As a region that puts forward the notions of consensus and non-sovereignty, concluding regional human rights norms is seen as a first step in solidifying human rights protection in the region. Unfortunately, since its establishment, the commission has failed to fulfill the expectations to implement protection-based regional norms in Southeast Asia, measured by their failure to effectively respond to systemic human rights abuses in the region. This article employs the Neoliberal Institutionalist’s view of Hegemonic Stability Theory (specifically to Robert Keohane) in analyzing how regional hegemons such as Indonesia, have deliberately directed the establishment of a weak human rights regime, in the form of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, which is proven by; (1) The Commission’s deficiencies in human rights protection, and (2) Indonesia’s lack of political will in solidifying human rights regimes in Southeast Asia.",TRUE,FALSE,AICHR|ASEAN|Foreign Policy|Indonesia|Regionalism,2020-12-04T18:37:42.971328,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-04T17:01:26.809557,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/citation/,xkfrp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/relationships/node/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc9ef316ebcc6021b46e330/,5fc9ef316ebcc6021b46e330,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkfrp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xkfrp/,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.03.04.227,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xkfrp

Basing analysis on social media data such as Yelp is a challenging task because review data is highly sparse and direct analysis may fail to uncover hidden trends. To this end, we propose a deep autoencoder approach for embedding the language of neighbourhood-based business reviews into a reduced dimensional space that facilitates similarity comparison of neighbourhoods and their change over time. Our model improves performance in distinguishing real and fake neighbourhood descriptions derived from real reviews, increasing performance in the task from an average accuracy of 0.46 to 0.77. This improvement in performance indicates that this novel application of embedded language analysis permits us to uncover comparative trends in neighbourhood change through the lens of their venues' reviews, providing a computational methodology for reading a city through its neighbourhoods. The resulting toolkit makes it possible to examine a city's current sociological trends in terms of its neighbourhoods' collective identities.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-04T17:02:02.203795,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-04T16:58:06.458259,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/citation/,8jbvg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc94e1aaa60b801d9894305/,5fc94e1aaa60b801d9894305,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8jbvg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8jbvg/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2020.103045,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8jbvg

As a result, individuals that reached college age in the years immediately after the military coup experienced a sharp decline in college enrollment. These individuals had worse labor market outcomes throughout the life cycle and struggled to climb up the socioeconomic ladder. Children with a parent in the affected cohorts are themselves less likely to enroll in university, even after democratization.

But how can we make sense of the potential landscape of all such research discovery tools? This paper conceptualizes a typology based on the common variable of bibliometric redundancy/variety. On the redundancy-reproducing end of the spectrum are machines that draw from co-citations or keyword queries (such as academic search engines and paper recommender systems). The variety-end harbours services that enable categorial browsing or that suggest publications randomly (such as journals’ tables of contents or random paper bots on Twitter). Currently, redundancy-reproducing research discovery tools proliferate. There is, in contrast, little awareness about variety-generating ones.

My claim is that recasting vacancy analysis in terms of agent-based models (ABMs) opens new possibilities both for vacancy chain analysis and for agent-based modelling. Concretely, I introduce the White-Chase-Sørensen (WCS) model, which leverages Harrison White’s insight of position-occupant duality to specify an ABM that explicitly casts absences–vacancies–as agents. WCS is superior to analytic, closed-form models of vacancy dynamics because it allows us to: 1) model off-equilibrium situations; 2) simulate multiple, overlapping, exogenous shocks of varying duration and intensity, e.g. social revolutions; 3) instantiate dynamic systems with an inherent tendency towards stability, i.e. prototypical bureaucracies; 4) refine theory through pattern-oriented modelling; 5) increase realism by relaxing standard Markovian assumptions of embeddedness, homogeneity, and stationarity; and 6) generate confidence bands for point estimates.

An Example from the Late Pre-hispanic US Southwest,"Archaeologists have regarded social networks as both the links through which people transmitted information and goods as well as a form of social storage creating relationships that could be drawn upon in times of subsistence shortfalls or other deleterious environmental conditions. In this article, formal social network analytical (SNA) methods are applied to archaeological data from the late pre-Hispanic North American Southwest to look at what kinds of social networks characterized those regions that were the most enduring versus those that were depopulated over a 250-year period (A.D. 1200–1450). In that time, large areas of the Southwest were no longer used for residential purposes, some of which corresponds with well-documented region-wide drought. Past research has demonstrated that some population levels could have been maintained in these regions, yet regional scale depopulation occurred. We look at the degree to which the network level property of embeddedness, along with population size, can help to explain why some regions were depopulated and others were not. SNA can help archaeologists examine why emigration occurred in some areas following an environmental crisis while other areas continued to be inhabited and even received migrants. Moreover, we modify SNA techniques to take full advantage of the time depth and spatial and demographic variability of our archaeological data set. The results of this study should be of interest to those who seek to understand human responses to past, present, and future worldwide catastrophes since it is now widely recognized that responses to major human disasters, such as hurricanes, were “likely to be shaped by pre-existing or new social networks” (as reported by Suter et al. (Research and Policy Review 28:1–10, 2009)).",TRUE,FALSE,archaeological networks|drought|E-I index|geosocial analysis|Hohokam|migration|Persistence|resilience|Salado|Social network analysis|social responses to crises|spatial analysis|spatial network analysis|Zuni,2020-12-02T21:38:42.023041,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-02T21:37:15.765740,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://cybersw.org/|https://lewisborck.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/e-i-index-script-hosted-online.docx,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/citation/,ubvxy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7nyqx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/relationships/node/,7nyqx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc7e287aa60b80133894a85/,5fc7e287aa60b80133894a85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubvxy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ubvxy/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-014-9236-5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ubvxy

Understanding the relationship between populations at different scales plays an important role in many demographic analyses.
OBJECTIVE
We show that when a population can be partitioned into subgroups, the death rate for the entire population can be written as the weighted harmonic mean of the death rates in each subgroup, where the weights are given by the numbers of deaths in each subgroup. This decomposition can be generalized to other types of occurrence-exposure rate. Using different weights, the death rate for the entire population can also be expressed as an arithmetic mean of the death rates in each subgroup.
CONTRIBUTION
We use these relationships as a starting point for investigating how demographers can correctly aggregate rates across non-overlapping subgroups. Our analysis reveals conceptual links between classic demographic
models and length-biased sampling. To illustrate how the harmonic mean can suggest new interpretations of demographic relationships, we present as an application a new expression for the frailty of the dying, given a standard demographic frailty model.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-02T21:40:41.052173,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-02T21:39:02.851051,FALSE,NA,no,"The empirical examples use the United States Mortality Database (https://usa.mortality.org/).
