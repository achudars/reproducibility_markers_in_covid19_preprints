It examines the students’ opinion regarding English online learning using the different internet or mobile applications. The participants were approximately 80 students from RAK Medical and Health Sciences University located in Ras Al Khaimah in The United Arab Emirates. A closed-ended questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. The results revealed that internet applications have a positive impact on learning English as a foreign language. Students’ attitudes towards using internet applications for learning English scored very high in certain areas, while the impact was lower in some other areas that is related to speaking, listening or to group discussions. Based on these results, the researcher suggests that internet applications can be activated at all stages of English language learning and teaching. The implementation of mobile and internet applications is recommended together with the face-to-face learning as a sort of blended learning. It can be budget friendly for universities and at the same time effortless for the students as long as it gives the same impact as face-to-face learning. Therefore, the significance of the study is to try to utilize the best online technological method for teaching and learning English Language that is useful to instructors, institutions as well as students.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-20T09:57:03.607601,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:25:43.449106,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/citation/,qk2dp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e50f60c818202e651071a/,607e50f60c818202e651071a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qk2dp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qk2dp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qk2dp

It adopts a case study methodology that relies on qualitative data-collection techniques, including reflections written by female undergraduates, informal conversations with these undergraduates, observational fieldnotes of classroom activities and a research journal. Relying on a social understanding of literacy, collected data are thematically analysed to examine how students view their experiences in this academic literacy event. Three major themes are highlighted in this study in relation to students’ experiences with this event: topic choice, fear and anxiety and the gains and losses associated with learning to prepare and make short presentations in English. Discussion sheds light on the impact of these experiences on the identity positions that learners develop and negotiate to participate in this event. It also highlights some of the challenges that mediate students’ experiences in this event and how they recognize and address these challenges.

Data were collected by means of a survey in which demographic data were elicited from the participants. Furthermore, the participants, whose ages were above 18 years, were asked to write their first names and reasons behind being given such names. The sample comprised 400 subjects who participated in the online survey distributed through social media network groups. The results revealed that names and naming practices are not haphazard ones. By and large, there is a relationship between the name and its usage, as stated by the causal theory of names. Whenever people choose a name, they are under the influence of; naming after people who are admired for their virtues, the aesthetic taste of the name, parents’ and relatives’ religious beliefs, maintaining rhyming names, circumstantial names, and respecting social and cultural traditions. Another striking finding is that nature and the environment are no longer rich resources for choosing names. Moreover, the analysis found evidence for the complete absence of names related to occupational and achievement names, death prevention and survival names, horrific names, and proverbial names. It is envisaged that the findings might be beneficial for sociolinguists, onomasticians, learners of Arabic as a foreign language, i.e. non-native speakers of Arabic.

This study is based on the results obtained from a previous research investigating interlanguage requests. The findings in that study suggested that the second language learners were not aware of some of the request strategies which were exclusively employed by the British English native speakers. The aim and the question of this study is to find out whether explicit instruction of request strategies will be effective in helping Saudi EFL learners gain linguistic knowledge and achieve pragmatic appropriateness in making requests in L2. Thirty female foundation year students participated in this study. They were all EFL learners studying at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The group underwent three phases of instruction: pre-test, instruction/intervention, and post-test. The first and last phases consisted of written questionnaires which were distributed right before and after the instruction phase. The results showed that in the third phase, the students demonstrated great progress in their understanding of request forms in L2.

(2) Are there any significant differences between male and female L2 Vietnamese students in metacognitive awareness of reading strategies? (3) Are there any significant differences between good, medium, and poor L2 Vietnamese readers in metacognitive awareness of reading strategies? One hundred and twenty-three English-majored undergraduates of Hong Bang International University completed an online survey which discovers their frequencies of using problem-solving, global, and support reading strategies. They next took a comprehension test on the TOEIC format test, whose results were adopted to classify students into three levels, namely good, medium, and poor readers. Reading strategies usage mean scores were compared across three strategy types and these scores were collated between groups. Results showed; first, reading strategies were used in academic texts at medium frequency level with the high usage of problem-solving strategies, followed by medium usage of support and global reading strategies. Second, female readers showed a higher frequency of using support strategies than males did. Third, learners’ proficiency levels were found to predict the levels of metacognitive awareness in reading with high-reading-ability students applying reading strategies more frequently than poor-reading-ability ones.

EFL teachers can lay the groundwork for their students to attain critical thinking through various methods, models, and strategies.  The present investigation suggests that the teacher could promote EFL learners’ critical thinking through guided discovery model of instruction. Henceforth, the current paper endeavors to enlighten the adequacy of applying guided discovery for developing learners’ critical thinking skills. It is an experimental research that investigates: how may guided discovery contribute to the development of EFL learners’ critical thinking? It attempts to examine the utility of discovery learning in teaching students how to process and think critically about the education they receive where information has become readily available and accessible. To this aim, 40 EFL Master students who took educational psychology courses were nominated from the university center of Naama, Algeria. The researcher selected Peter Honey Critical Thinking test and focus group discussions to attain data on students’ critical thinking skills. The test results demonstrated that the experimental group outperformed the control group.

To fill in the gaps regarding literature, this research paper was designed to explore the views of three Master of Art (MA) TESOL student-teachers on the advantages they gained and challenges they faced during their TP course at a Saudi university. Participants were interviewed, observed, and the two reflective assignments of the course were analyzed to find answers to the research questions. The research questions focused on the instructional benefits of the TP course and the interventions needed to enhance the effectiveness of the course. The findings revealed that the practical teaching component was the most helpful part of the course and the peer-observation report was the most appropriate evaluation method. Moreover, the study found that the limitedness of the teaching timeframe poses a significant challenge, and hence increasing the teaching practice time was the most significant change the participants suggested. Finally, the study recommends interventions that will help improve the quality of the TP course.",TRUE,FALSE,English language teaching in Saudi Arabia|qualitative research|Saudi EFL teachers|student-teachers|teaching practicum (TP),2021-04-20T09:35:04.274438,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:22:40.994987,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/citation/,azjcg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e4916eb9cc902d915310a/,607e4916eb9cc902d915310a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/azjcg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/azjcg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/azjcg

Most of the current available Arabic corpora, modern standard or dialectical, are monolingual in nature and there is an apparent lack in the Arabic-English parallel corpora for translation classroom. The present study was aimed to investigate the translation problems encountered by Omani translation major students when translating from Arabic into English with a view to proposing some corpus-informed pedagogy approach for training student translators to overcome these challenges by looking at some model samples of professional translation. Thirty students voluntarily took part in the investigation. The study adopted a combination of both corpus and qualitative methodology whereby some typical problems students would encounter when translating from Arabic-into-English were selected along with some specific Arabic texts involving these problems were prepared and the participants were asked to translate them into English. The participants were provided with some samples of the parallel English translated texts and were asked to compare and contrast their translations with these samples and reflect on the overall experience. They were then interviewed to explore their impressions about and the extent to which they think that parallel corpora would help them improve their translation. Results of data analysis indicated that the participants experienced several translation challenges. They, however, showed an overall positive attitude towards parallel Arabic-English corpora as they reportedly found them very helpful in improving their translation. Pedagogical implications for corpus-informed translation teaching, training and materials design and development are presented and discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-20T09:33:02.678820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-20T09:21:46.077066,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/citation/,ewf62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607e482deb9cc902df1555f2/,607e482deb9cc902df1555f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewf62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewf62/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol12no1.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewf62
