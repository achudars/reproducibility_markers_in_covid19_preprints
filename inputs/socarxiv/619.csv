This research evaluates the legacy of slavery on long-run development and its detailed mechanism which consists of two key factors, labor market institutions and human capital structure. Using county-level data of the U.S. South and exploiting exogenous variation in ecological conditions, I show that slavery has had persistent negative impact on economic development through the human capital structure. To explain the link between slavery and human capital, I find from complete count census data in 1940 that the legacy of slavery impeded integration of black workers into the competitive labor market which accordingly reduced the incentives of blacks to invest in human capital. In addition, evidence from the progressive Era along the border counties shows that the legacy of slavery on the labor market was operated through selective enforcement of labor market regulations. Lastly, I present the roles of racial wage discrimination and selective migration which reinforced persistence of the mechanism.",TRUE,FALSE,human capital|institutions|labor market|mechanism|persistence|slavery,2018-07-02T11:39:51.312946,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-23T11:05:54.874096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Yeonha Jung,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/citation/,snpg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8f42dada91d4000faedb85/,5a8f42dada91d4000faedb85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snpg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/snpg2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/snpg2,NA

In conjunction with amicus briefs filed by the Department of Justice seemingly supporting LGBT+ discrimination by employers or businesses, LGBTQ+ students may feel even more vulnerable in the college environment. But, to assume that homophobia or transphobia is felt only by those who identify under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, is to misunderstand the fluidity and complexity of gender and sexuality. Because gender is a material aspect of their college experience for all students. 
College admissions forms typically only ask for the students' sex assigned at birth, and sexuality is typically not asked on admissions' forms. Facilities on campus including bathrooms, changing facilities, campus housing, and athletics are commonly segregated by sex (Beemyn, 2005). Rules that police what genders are allowed in certain spaces do not just impact trans* and non-binary people; however, the extent to which anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment has had negative repercussions for heterosexual and cisgender students, is unknown and understudied.
Our goal for this study is twofold. First, we want to explore levels of gender marginalization on college campuses and then, we want to better understand who is at risk of feeling marginalized. In addition to conventional measures of sex, gender and sexual identities we explore novel, scaled measures of how students see themselves, and how they think others see them, with respect to masculinity, femininity, and androgyny.",TRUE,FALSE,androgyny|college|femininity|gender|gender image|LGBT|marginalization|masculinity|students,2018-07-02T11:39:50.436107,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-22T22:38:01.666729,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/citation/,kg6f2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vxbty/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/relationships/node/,vxbty,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8e423d91b689000f9e3796/,5a8e423d91b689000f9e3796,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kg6f2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kg6f2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kg6f2,NA

I provide a unified framework incorporating both channels by allowing for non-homothetic preferences and worker heterogeneity across jobs. Because skill-intensive goods are also high-income elastic in the data, I find an intuitive, previously unexplored, and strong interaction between the two channels. I parametrize the model for 40 regions using sector-level trade and production data, and find that trade cost reductions decrease the relative nominal wage of the poor and the relative price index for the poor in all regions. On net, real-wage inequality falls everywhere.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:39:49.089692,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-21T19:06:04.565070,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,Zheli he,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/citation/,bme6k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qpb63/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/relationships/node/,qpb63,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8ce230da91d4000fad253c/,5a8ce230da91d4000fad253c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bme6k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bme6k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bme6k,NA

The study finds shift in spatial and temporal deixis that manifests a strong tendency towards increasing the ‘level of enunciation’ of narrators’ spatial and temporal location within the narrative. This shift brings the main narrator closer to the other characters in temporal, spatial, and mental space, hence increasing her involvement in events and empathy towards characters. At the same time, it distances the outside frame narrator, who has limited contact with characters, and increases his detachment and antipathy. In both cases more is revealed of narrator-character relationships and the narrator’s evaluations, leading to a more subjective narrative mood. It is hoped that the study will be applicable to different translated literary works to compare the findings and gain more understanding on the norms of English-Arabic fiction translation.",TRUE,FALSE,deixis|literary translation|narrative point of view|standardization|translation shifts,2018-07-02T11:39:48.074606,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-02-20T17:39:52.525132,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/citation/,ytaz6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hxkfa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/relationships/node/,hxkfa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a8babb060511e000ddcdaaa/,5a8babb060511e000ddcdaaa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ytaz6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytaz6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ytaz6,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no1.14
