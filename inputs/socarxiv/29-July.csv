High Uyghur population concentrations are deemed a national security threat. “Optimizing” such concentrations is achieved by embedding substantial Han populations. Scenarios that do not overburden the region’s population carrying capacity entail drastic reductions in ethnic minority natural population growth. The intent to “optimize” the population serves as a basis to assess the intent to destroy an ethnic minority population in part, as outlined in the 1948 U.N. Genocide Convention. The “destruction in part” is assessed as the difference between projected natural population growth without substantial government interference, and reduced growth scenarios in line with population “optimization” requirements.

For example, at present, there is widespread debate about how individuals come to perceive events as immoral. In this paper, I use sociological approaches to cultural meaning to test one of the leading theories of moral cognition: the idea that individuals attribute immorality through template matching. I use spatial measures of cultural meaning to define and locate a prototypical moral wrong. I then test the theory of template matching, and find evidence that distance from the typical moral transgression - in semantic space - is related to the time it takes to categorize an event as immoral or harmful. I then test these results on a corpus of naturally occurring text to assess their external validity. These studies provide empirical evidence supporting the notion that the attribution of immorality occurs through template matching.

However, as time goes by, Indonesian culture has begun to be displaced. Indonesians, especially the younger generations, are beginning to abandon the local culture. They prefer more on Western culture, which they found as modern ones and adopt their lifestyle without even filtering it.  As a result,  Indonesia has their character identity. Other countries have repeatedly claimed some Indonesian heritage because of its people habits that don't care about their culture. Therefore, it is important to build a cultural character for the young generations to reflect, loves and cherishes their culture.           
Ways to Improve the Young Generations Culture was written for Indonesian people, especially the young generations who have forgotten about their culture. Hopefully, it will help the young generations realize how much they have abandoned their own culture and how their preferred foreign cultures are unsuitable. Ways to Improve the Young Generations Culture reintroduced Indonesian culture from each region to remind millennials about that the identity of the Indonesian nation has begun to drift away was also explained. Aside from that, there are solutions and tips to preserve and introduce Indonesian culture to the international market. It contains various new information widely unknown by the young generation, such as cultural awareness, the theory of cultural synchronization, cultural confrontation, cultural experience, cultural knowledge, and how millennials preserve their culture. With that being said, it will be undoubtedly helpful for the readers' lives that persuade them to care more about their society and their culture. The evidence presented was pretty convincing because, in reality, the young generations does consider Indonesian culture outdated. They even tend to boast about Western culture more than Indonesian culture. It discusses an interesting and relevant theme; hence, people are attracted to this Siti Nur Aidah’s work. As Indonesians, especially the young generations who holds the key to taking care of our culture, we should read this book as it plays an important part in improving the character of the young generations so Indonesian culture will continue to rise instead of facing extinction due to globalization.

Blockmodeling is one of the most commonly used approaches in the analysis of (social) networks, which deals with the analysis of relationships or connections, between the units studied (e.g., peoples, organizations, journals etc.). The R package blockmodeling implements several approaches for the generalized blockmodeling of binary and valued networks. Generalized blockmodeling is commonly used to cluster nodes in a network with regard to the structure of their links. The theoretical foundations of generalized blockmodeling for binary and valued networks are summarized in the paper while the use of the R package blockmodeling is illustrated by applying it to an empirical dataset.",TRUE,FALSE,blockmodeling|network analysis|R programming language,2021-06-08T07:37:41.805275,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-08T07:37:19.886382,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/citation/,b8cxp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qk8h2/,qk8h2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60be32899096b70507643a8f/,60be32899096b70507643a8f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8cxp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8cxp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8cxp

Hence, the capital has the inclination for concentration and centralization in the hands of the richest and big capitalists. Actually, the concentration and centralization of capital are two capital accumulation (or self-expansion of capital) techniques. Such concentration and centralization of capital can be clearly detected at this modern time, especially in the USA, in the enormous occurrences of mergers, acquisitions and conglomerates. In this assignment, henceforth, I will be trying to cultivate an analytical discussion about these two interlinked concepts and their implications and repercussions in this modern world of capitalism.",TRUE,FALSE,Capital|Capital Centralization|Capital Concentration,2021-06-07T15:07:22.266811,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-07T15:01:06.899652,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/citation/,7qbe9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60be15c4cb2a5e04f868a9ca/,60be15c4cb2a5e04f868a9ca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7qbe9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7qbe9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7qbe9
