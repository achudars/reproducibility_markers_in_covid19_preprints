These prohibitions are entirely separate from the exclusive rights under copyright, causing some commentators to dub the anti-circumvention right as ""paracopyright."" Such ""paracopyright"" effectively grants copyright holders sweeping new ability to impose terms of access on content users: consumers who access content without accepting the content owner's terms would violate the owner's ""paracopyright"" even if the material accessed is not itself copyrighted or copyrightable.


At some point, such leveraging of access control seems certain to overstep the bounds militated by sound policy or intended by Congress. In the past, abuse of intellectual property rights has been curtailed under the doctrine of misuse. Misuse claims first arose in the patent context, where the patent might be leveraged into licensing terms that exceeded the proper scope of the patent grant. More recently, overreaching in copyright licensing has been recognized to constitute a form of misuse.  This paper argues that because DMCA ""paracopyright"" is ripe for abuse, limits on overreaching may be imposed by applying the misuse doctrine in this new area. Just as improper leveraging of patent and copyright may be curtailed by application of the misuse doctrine, so improper leveraging of paracopyright should be curtailed by application of misuse. This new application of misuse doctrine may be guided by the standards established in previous applications to patent and copyright law, and may serve a similar function in regulating the excesses invited by the anticircumvention right.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,copyright|digital rights management|DMCA|DRM|paracopyright|Preprint|socarxiv|technical protection measures|TPM,2018-07-02T10:47:34.245545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T19:02:34.087000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/citation/,9w6rz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/etde3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/relationships/node/,etde3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578a84cc594d9001f5859eed/,578a84cc594d9001f5859eed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9w6rz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9w6rz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9w6rz

Previous explanations for these differences range from biological predispositions of risk aversion to patriarchal gender socialization, but all largely overlook the intersection of social statuses. Drawing on theories of intersectionality, we contribute to the cultural and empirical analysis of gender gaps in religiosity by documenting an interactive effect between gender, education, and political views for predicting religious nonaffiliation and infrequent attendance at religious services among Americans. For highly educated political liberals, gender gaps effectively disappear, such that men and women are almost equally likely to be secular (or religious). The results have implications for the long-standing disputes about the gendered ""nature"" of religiosity and highlight the importance of multiple intersecting statuses and modalities in shaping aggregate patterns of religiosity and secularity.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,education|gender|intersectionality|politics|Preprint|religion|religiosity|secularity|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:05.246562,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T18:53:42.543000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/citation/,re8sk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mw7qc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/relationships/node/,mw7qc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578a82b89ad5a101f5f5c3ac/,578a82b89ad5a101f5f5c3ac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re8sk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/re8sk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/re8sk

digital edition and invite everyone? What if millions of scholars,
first-time readers, book clubs, teachers and their students show up and
annotate a text with their infinite interpretations, questions, and
contextualizations?"". Approaching digital editions as Morris Eaves'
""problem-solving mechanism""s, the project designed, built, and user-tested
a digital edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses with various experimental
interface features: InfiniteUlysses.com. Three areas of research advanced
through the project are presented: designing public and participatory
edition projects, and whether critical participation is necessary to such
projects; designing digital edition functionalities and appearance to serve
a participatory audience, and what we learn about such an endeavor through
Infinite Ulysses' user experience data; and separating the values of
textual scholarship from their embodiments to imagine new types of edition.
A review of theoretical and built precedents from textual scholarship,
scholarly design and code projects, public and participatory humanities
endeavors, and theories around a digital Ulysses grounds the report,
followed by an overview of the features of the Infinite Ulysses
participatory digital edition. Section 2 discusses existing examples of
public participation in digital humanities (DH) projects, Section 3 focuses

success or failure at learning through digital texts. The narrative
responses suggest that while the idea of new learning from digital texts is

Their efforts have met with resistance at each of these points, however, because they have failed to appreciate the insight articulated by Michel Foucault that governing people, in the broad sense, is not only a matter of making them behave; it's also a matter of making them want to behave. This article surveys a decade's worth of anti-piracy regulation and examines the ways in which the entertainment industry's recourse to coercion at every point of intervention has functioned to undermine rather than advance the anti-piracy cause.

Lime Group pending in federal district court in New York, then New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo began pressuring broadband providers to agree voluntarily to play a greater role in fighting online infringement. Subsequently, the Obama administration, represented nationally by the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) and internationally by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), expressly endorsed the concept of privately negotiated anti-piracy collaborations between corporate rights owners and broadband providers.

In July of 2011, broadband providers finally bowed to the mounting political pressure and to changing economic realities in the business of corporate content ownership and delivery. Five of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with trade groups representing major corporate copyright owners. The MOU creates what the parties characterize as a common framework of 'best practices' to effectively alert subscribers, protect copyrighted content and promote access to legal online content.

This Article is an assessment of the MOU's Copyright Alert System (CAS) with respect to five norms that are central to consumer protection in the enterprise of online copyright enforcement: freedom of expression, privacy, fairness, proportionality, and transparency. Part I provides an introduction to graduated response, which is the genus of online copyright enforcement to which CAS belongs. Part II takes a comparative look at two pre-existing graduated response systems: the government mandated and administered program in France, Hadopi, and a privately administered program in Ireland run by the broadband provider Eircom. Part III provides a detailed overview of CAS, including the structure by which it is governed, the division of labor it prescribes between copyright owners and broadband providers, the progression of warnings and sanctions it implements, and the appeals process it makes available for affected broadband subscribers. Part IV evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of CAS with respect to each of the five norms listed above, using the systems in France and Ireland as reference points.

In this paper I look at how Asian immigrant parents’ own marital decisions shape their understanding of their children’s marriageability and race in the U.S. I introduce an analytical framework that I call ‘marital boundary-making’ to show how differences between ‘marriageable us’ and ‘undesirable them’ are perceived by individuals in different family positions. I use data from 35 interviews with Taiwan-origin immigrant parents residing in San Diego to show how structural assimilation does not necessarily lead to white desirability, even among immigrants who have collectively achieved high socioeconomic status. I found that while the intermarried parents described a color-blind type of marital boundary that plays down race, the coethnic parents expressed a preference hierarchy with Taiwanese at the top. Neither group expressed a strong preference for whites. Further, even though the parents’ marriageable perceptions were inconsistent, their undesirable interpretations were identical—evidence of a black/non-black racial divide. The findings challenge the assumption commonly found in immigration studies that intermarriage with whites represents a form of social mobility.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:11.489011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T12:26:35.287000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/citation/,m98hy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hxp6n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/relationships/node/,hxp6n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578a27fdb83f6901f0c062ef/,578a27fdb83f6901f0c062ef,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m98hy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m98hy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m98hy
