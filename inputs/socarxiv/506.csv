The researcher adopts the view of social learning, particularly in reaching better understandings of the learners’ experiences in learning English. As there exists a tendency to gauge learners’ success in English based on examinations, this study asserts that language learning involves more than a cognitive process, thus values the social aspects of experiential English learning. The focus lies on investigating the perceptions of these high achieving English language learners of their success in learning English as well as the influences contributing to it. Two methods are used to collect data: focus groups and interviews. The findings indicate the participants’ perceptions of their own success in learning English in three main aspects:  English language ability, examination performance and skills in teaching others. In particular, the ability to speak English fluently and correctly appears to be of utmost importance for a successful English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learner. It is also found that most learners identify their own performance in class, the teacher, including teacher rapport, and school culture as contributing to their English learning achievement. In focusing on the learners’ perceptions and their actual experiences, insights into how the learners actually undergo the learning opportunities provided by the education system can be obtained. To understand the extent to which innovations in English language teaching and learning have been successful, the everyday realities of the language classroom and school have to be accentuated.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL learners|English learning|learning context|learning experiences,2019-01-04T19:20:46.826332,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T19:20:09.350762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/citation/,ze7mr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2be74da7c0a700193c7491/,5c2be74da7c0a700193c7491,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ze7mr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ze7mr/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ze7mr

Among the difficulties to incorporate IC into FLT can be due to the fact that teachers may not have sufficient knowledge on the concept. To test this hypothesis, we attempt to answer the following question: how do Algerian English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers perceive the concepts of culture and IC as well as the objectives of the intercultural approach (ICA) in English language teaching (ELT) contexts? The present study proceeds to analyze teachers’ knowledge, perceptions and understanding of the concepts of culture, IC and the ICA and seeks to identify any potential deficiencies that may hinder effective IC teaching. The main aim of the study is then to help teacher trainers establish training programs that address more efficiently targeted teachers’ needs with regard to IC teaching. This paper will hopefully assist in improving the implementation of IC into FLT classrooms. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with eight teachers and then analyzed thematically. The findings revealed that many EFL teachers displayed a lack of theoretical understanding concerning the ICA and its objectives, which may well impact negatively on their IC teaching practices. Teacher educators therefore need to focus more on updating EFL teachers’ on both the theoretical and practical levels that learners are today expected to grow as cultural mediators equipped with a set of skills rather than as native-like proficient language users.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|ELT|intercultural competence|perceptions,2019-01-04T18:01:21.419894,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T18:00:59.597175,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/citation/,c67ns,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2be63c28af78001c646fd0/,5c2be63c28af78001c646fd0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c67ns/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c67ns/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c67ns

This study proposes that there is a negative treatment of athletes by other students in the classroom. It also reveals that athletes have lower GPAs than non-athletes. Using a data set collected at Skidmore College in 2006, these questions are analyzed. This study investigates the degree to which athletes perform compared to non-athletes and their treatment by other students. The sample had 361 valid respondents of whom 50 percent were athletes, and 66 percent of the sample were women. The results demonstrate that athletes, on the whole, have lower GPAs than non-athletes. It also shows that women have higher GPAs than men, which was expected. Based on the findings at Skidmore College in 2006, students did not feel that they were treated poorly by other students just because they were athletes.

The signs were first coded according to language, and then categorized within the framework of material practices enacted by sign designers. The results show that signs written on stone and metal surfaces often displaying English in uppercase letters and replicating governmental practices convey a sense of quality, continuity and permanence within economic and tourism-centered ideologies and polices; the visibility of English painted on wooden board signs is evidence of the creativity further manifested in block capitals to denote a sense of freshness and newness; signs printed and hand-written on paper often appearing in uppercase letters manifest the dynamic nature of the LL, ensuring the flow of special offers and even linguistic and non-linguistic changes; most remarkably, monolingual English signs painted inside sand bottles symbolize important environmental, historical, and cultural information on the ancient city of Petra, which contributes significantly to the popularity of Petra as a worldwide tourist destination among members of the tourist population, particularly the international visitors.",TRUE,FALSE,English|linguistic and paralinguistic practices|linguistic landscape|materiality|Petra,2019-01-04T18:00:27.124462,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-04T18:00:13.135137,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/citation/,zt8xg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2be35f0e8efd0017d08dd6/,5c2be35f0e8efd0017d08dd6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt8xg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zt8xg/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zt8xg

The study follows the methodological synergy approach proposed by Baker et al. (2008), a heuristic methodological approach that combines methods of discourse analysis and corpus-assisted statistical tools including keyword, collocation, and concordance analysis. Drawing on this methodological synergy approach, the investigation yields significant findings contextualized within the socio-economic-political context of the European Union (EU) leave referendum to trace how the issue of immigration is represented in the discourses of the Remain and Leave campaigns. The frequency results show that immigration is one of the most salient topics in the Brexit corpus. Concordance analysis of the word immigrants and collocation investigation of the word immigration reveal opposing attitudes toward immigration in the EU referendum debate. The analysis uncovers negative attitudes toward the uncontrolled flow of immigrants from other EU countries and public concerns about immigrants' negative impacts on wages, education, and health services. Other findings reveal positive attitudes toward immigrants emphasizing their positive contributions to the UK economy.

Additionally, findings from the study elucidate the learning principles of good games that incorporate the dynamics of gaming which induce the language learner to be active generators of information, knowledge and language.

Indeed, visual sequences of punctuation from different authors produce marvelously different (and visually striking) sequences. Punctuation is a largely overlooked stylistic feature in ``stylometry'', the quantitative analysis of written text. In this paper, we examine punctuation sequences in a corpus of literary documents and ask the following questions: Are the properties of such sequences a distinctive feature of different authors? Is it possible to distinguish literary genres based on their punctuation sequences? Do the punctuation styles of authors evolve over time? Are we on to something interesting in trying to do stylometry without words, or are we full of sound and fury (signifying nothing)?",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-01-01T13:21:27.115741,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-01T13:20:53.535031,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dff|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/citation/,2rzsg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2acbdda7c0a700193c293a/,5c2acbdda7c0a700193c293a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2rzsg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2rzsg

The cultural evolutionary scholarship disagrees regarding what was the main factor responsible for the emergence and spread of these innovations over the past few millennia. Proponents of the Big Gods Hypothesis suggest that this development should be primarily associated with changes in social complexity, since representations of powerful and morally concerned deities represent a factor promoting cooperation among strangers in large-scale societies and thus a cultural selection advantage for groups adopting these innovations. Advocates of the Affluence Hypothesis suggest that the emergence and spread of morally oriented religious systems has to be primarily coupled with economic development, namely with an increase in affluence, which occurred during the so-called “Axial Age” period. According to this proposal, an increase in affluence enabled adoption of ""slow"" life-history strategies by certain proportion of the population, what led to emergence of new form of religion, emphasizing morality, long-terms goals and practices of self-control. This paper contributes to this debate by focusing on historical setting often referred to in both of these proposals: the ancient Mediterranean. Using quantitative text analysis methods in analyzing a corpus of ancient Greek texts from the period from 800 BC to 400 CE, this study offers a more nuanced view of the process under scrutiny than the one which has been proposed in previous ethnographic and comparative studies. Finding statistically significant differences in the context of usage of the Greek term theos (god) in the texts from the pre-axial and axial period, the obtained results can be more easily interpreted in terms of the Affluence Hypothesis than in terms of the competing account.",TRUE,FALSE,Affluence Hypothesis|Axial Age|Big Gods|Cognitive Science of Religion|Cultural Evolution|Life History Theory|Quantitative Text Analysis|Vector Semantics,2018-12-31T17:30:01.764013,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-31T17:29:46.020628,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb4|Arts and Humanities|Religion|History of Religions of Western Origin|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb7|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Comparative Methodologies and Theories|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/citation/,3tjb7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8j5vm/,8j5vm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c298791a7c0a700183e83e3/,5c298791a7c0a700183e83e3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3tjb7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3tjb7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3tjb7
