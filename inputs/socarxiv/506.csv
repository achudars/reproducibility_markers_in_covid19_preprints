Vogues in name usage can be easily shown on a case by case basis, by plotting the rise and fall in their popularity over time. However, individual name choices are not made in isolation and trends in naming are better understood as group-level phenomena. Here we use network analysis to examine onomastic (name) datasets in order to explore the influences on name choices within the UK over the last 170 years. Using a large representative sample of approximately 22 million chosen forenames from England and Wales given between 1838 and 2014, along with a complete population sample of births registered between 1996 and 2016, we demonstrate how trends in name usage can be visualised as network graphs.
By exploring the structure of these graphs, various patterns of name use become readily apparent, which can be interpreted in the context of historic events, such as known waves of migration. In general, we show that the topology of network graphs can reveal naming vogues, and that naming vogues are a reflection of social and demographic changes.
Many name choices are consistent with a self-correcting feedback loop, whereby rarer names become common because there are virtues perceived in their rarity, yet with these perceived virtues lost upon increasing commonality. Towards the present day, the comparatively greater range of media, freedom of movement, and ability to maintain globally-distributed social networks increases the number of possible names, but also ensures they may more quickly be perceived as commonplace. Consequently, contemporary naming vogues are relatively short-lived with many name choices appearing a balance struck between recognisability and rarity.

Despite the dependence of many rural communities in India on communal water sources and treatment plants for safe drinking water, they often fail to collectively manage these resources, resulting in abandoned water points and treatment systems with consequent health and mortality impacts. Results of public goods games framed in terms of the management of communal water treatment systems suggest that observability (public disclosure of behaviour) had the very significant effect of decreasing contributions to the public good. Analysis suggests this was mainly due to conformity to frequently-observed free-riding. Only when participants were actively encouraged to negotiate agreements, did cooperation increase significantly - albeit intermittently. These results show that the success of institutional design principles devised to increase cooperation depends on existing social norms and practices in the community of interest.

We find that in the aggregate, individuals positively condition their redistribution choices on the contributions of first-movers in their group, suggesting conformity to peers. However, examination of second-mover ‘types’ (classified using the full vector of individual contributions stated in response to a range of first-mover donations) indicates that only 17% can be classed as ‘conformists’; the remaining major 'types' include self-interested players (42%), unconditional givers (22%) and ‘compensators’ (8.3%). Most strikingly, the first observable amount presented to second-movers in the strategy game (the anchor) is found to influence the likelihood of choosing a giving strategy versus a self-interested strategy. Specifically, low anchors increase the likelihood of selecting self-interested strategies, whilst high anchors increase the likelihood of conformist and compensating strategies. The distribution of ‘types’ is therefore dependent on the initial conditions of play in the strategy game.

The dimension problem consists of a simple dilemma: when we aggregate, the observer must choose the dimension of analysis. The dilemma is that this choice affects the resulting measurement. This means that aggregate measurements are dependent on one's goals, and on underlying theory. I explore the consequences of this predicament for ecological and biophysical economics.  I discuss the many problems of using 'real' monetary value as the dimension of analysis.  And I highlight how the dimension problem undermines the  practice of seeking 'optimal' policy.  Although there are no solutions, I discuss ways that ecological and biophysical economists can deal with the dimension problem.",TRUE,FALSE,aggregation|ecological economics|GDP|measurement|sustainability,2018-07-02T11:56:46.665700,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-21T13:57:31.535494,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/citation/,tfwju,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3smra/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/relationships/node/,3smra,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2a692e0465ee001200790e/,5b2a692e0465ee001200790e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfwju/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tfwju/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tfwju,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41247-018-0051-6

Despite some evidence that risk concerns vary across societies and risk domains, these variations remain understudied. To address this gap, this paper conducts a multi-level analysis of public concerns about biological and chemical/technical food risks in 26 European countries. Findings confirm previous work on individual predictors of risk concern and suggest that several contextual factors contribute to cross-national variations: aggregate perceptions of risks as unnatural, retail concentration in the food sector, and media coverage. The effect of institutional trust on risk concerns varies substantially across nations. Findings also reveal important differences in public concerns about biological versus chemical/technical food risks, supporting the view that food risk perception is multi-dimensional and complex.",TRUE,FALSE,cross-national|food safety|multi-level modeling|risk perception,2018-07-02T11:56:46.274469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-20T13:43:41.166303,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/citation/,c2khw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hz4wn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/relationships/node/,hz4wn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b29e55b76e62b000d27ed94/,5b29e55b76e62b000d27ed94,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c2khw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2khw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c2khw,https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2017.1422789
