The strike was called in opposition to a 75 per cent increase in university tuition fees announced by Québec’s Liberal government under then-Premier, Jean Charest. From February 2012 until the following September, the streets of Montreal, Québec City and other towns in the province were alive with demonstrations and protest actions. Students walked out of class and stayed out, picketing their academic institutions and even holding barricades against police intervention; over 3,000 people were arrested over the course of those few months, new repressive laws were introduced and resisted, and solidarity between groups and across sectors was built and tested.
The aim of this book is both to provide a glimpse into the lived experience of this social movement for the benefit of those who were not a part of it, and to uncover some of the lessons that can be garnered from a reflexive look back at the movement. It brings together contributions by students and non-students, academics, parents, activists, anarchists, artists, and others, most of which were written as the mass mobilizations began to subside in the fall of 2012. The book is meant to be accessible to a wide audience, including those without previous knowledge of the 2012 strike or the Québec context. It is our hope that the information and ideas shared in the chapters that follow will inspire and inform reflection and future social movement action in Québec and elsewhere.

This project represents a massive undertaking – it is billed as the largest drinking water project in the world – and is part of a broader predilection toward large, concrete-heavy supply-side solutions to water insecurity across present-day India. This paper tracks the claims and narratives used to promote the project, the political context in which it has emerged, the purposes it serves and, following Ferguson (1990), the functioning of the discursive-bureaucratic 'machine' of which it is a product.
The dam’s reinvention as the solution to Gujarat’s drinking water shortfall – increasingly for cities and Special Industrial Regions – reflects a concern with attracting and retaining foreign investment through the creation of so-called 'world-class' infrastructure. At the same time, this reinvention has contributed to a project of nation-building, while remaining cloaked in a discourse of technological neutrality. The heavy infrastructure renders visible Gujarat’s commitment to 'development' even when that promise has yet to be realised for many, while the promise of Narmada water gives Gujarat’s leaders political capital with favoured investors and political supporters. In conclusion, I suggest that the success of infrastructure mega-projects as a political tool is not intrinsically tied to their ability to achieve their technical and social objectives. Instead, the 'spectacle' of ambitious infrastructural development projects may well yield political gains that outweigh, for a time, the real-world costs of their inequity and unsustainability.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-politics|Development|Gujarat|Narmada pipeline project|Sardar Sarovar Dam,2018-07-02T10:59:30.543199,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-07T14:58:45.694386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d17|Arts and Humanities|South and Southeast Asian Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/citation/,ewa8b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vr8hs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/relationships/node/,vr8hs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59381261b83f69022b7c6bf5/,59381261b83f69022b7c6bf5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ewa8b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ewa8b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ewa8b,NA

Scant attention, however, has been paid to associations between religious participation and safety risks among adolescents. Using data from Add Health (N = 18,449), a nationally representative school-based sample of US adolescents, this study examines the relationship between adolescents’ religious affiliation and easy access to firearms at home. Regression analyses adjust for complex sampling design and compare easy firearm access at home among conservative Protestant adolescents to adolescent firearm access in other religious traditions. Conservative Protestant adolescents have a substantially greater likelihood of easy access to a gun at home compared to adolescents of all other major religious traditions in the United States. Recognizing differences in adolescent firearm access between subcultural groups can help public health interventions more effectively identify and address the needs of vulnerable populations.

For D. H. Lawrence (1885 –1930), myth became one of the most important elements in both his fictional and non fictional works. Taking well-known examples, he reinterpreted them as an illustration of his own personal vision. This article is limited to a study of three major fictional works: The Rainbow, Women in Love and The Virgin and The Gypsy and attempts to analyse them in the light of the Genesis myth. It hinges on the hypothesis that Lawrence, by condemning orthodox religious beliefs, formulated his own creation myth: his regenesis.  He attempted to expose the false ideals of conventional society, which had for centuries destroyed man’s natural intuition, by a re-examination of the Genesis myth. By using an analytical approach, this article aims to answer several provocative questions. Firstly, how far did Lawrence succeed in undermining conventional authority? Secondly, how successful was he in formulating his philosophy of regenesis? Thirdly, to what extent can this philosophy be seen as an answer to the problems of the age?",TRUE,FALSE,Darwinism|genesis|myth|mythical revival|regenesis,2018-07-02T10:59:29.538026,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T20:36:52.123474,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/citation/,8wyba,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mz3vn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/relationships/node/,mz3vn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59346e9a9ad5a10250079b85/,59346e9a9ad5a10250079b85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wyba/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8wyba/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8wyba,NA

This is the main question of this paper. In reading Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time (1927), the readers construct a figure in their mind of a persona about whom all the philosophical reflections are discussed. Heidegger presents Dasein as a ‘particular being’ that characterizes all the features of human existence. Heidegger did not want to define and explain ‘being’, but he aimed at presenting a ‘sense of being’ in the form of characterizing the philosophical reflections he was presenting. After discussing how it can be claimed that Dasein can be considered a ‘fictional character’ in the absence of a ‘plot,’ the present article explains the main aspects through which a ‘fictional character’ is constructed, or figured out, in readers’ mind. It tries, also, to show how and why Heidegger resorts to this technique of fictional characterization in this highly influential philosophical book. The article specifies four main personality models, that help construct Dasein as a ‘fictional character’ in the reader’s mind. These personality models are: being-in-world, being-in-time, living-by-activity, and living-to-an-end. By ascribing such personality models to Dasein, Heidegger managed to present in his work a character that can be easily remembered all the time Being and Time is mentioned.",TRUE,FALSE,being|character|characterization|fiction|Heidegger,2018-07-02T10:59:29.503178,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T20:31:38.971094,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/citation/,5hxm8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kqz6r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/relationships/node/,kqz6r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59346d98594d90024fe8842d/,59346d98594d90024fe8842d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5hxm8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5hxm8,NA

Because the pair of languages under investigation is genetically and thus typologically different, it calls into question how to tackle complexity in morphology and syntax in translation. The paper brings into focus Arabic inflections which indicate ‘emphasis, duality and gender’, and how they may be properly approached. Additionally, the syntactic constituents of Cognate Accusative Object, Causative Object, Accusative of State and Substitute are examined in Arabic and how they can be overcome in translation. Evidence from the Holy Quran has been adduced for illustration and elucidation purposes as necessity demands. Last but not least, pleonasm and paronomasia have been linguistically pulled apart, to be followed by an approach to grappling with such phenomena in translation. Some strategies have been referred to, or devised in cases of the above constituents and the like.",TRUE,FALSE,Al-Muallaqat|Arberry’s Translation|inflections|morpho-syntactic complexity|pleonasm,2018-07-02T10:59:29.467556,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T20:28:11.339057,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/citation/,p6xn5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8xmpn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/relationships/node/,8xmpn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59346ce19ad5a1025207840f/,59346ce19ad5a1025207840f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6xn5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p6xn5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p6xn5,NA

It examines the Chinese translation of an English legal judgment “Attorney General v Lee Kwong-kut and Attorney General v Lo Chak-man and another”(Hong Kong Public Law Reports, 1993) by the Privy Council. It combines the source-text analysis with translation strategies from the perspective of semantics, syntax and register, in order to discuss how theories can be applied in real-life legal translation setting. The source text contains distinctive examples of legalese, convoluted sentence structure and honorific addresses specific to Anglo legal context. The Chinese translation is challenging as to how to cope with the linguistic and cultural differences, and most significantly, how to carry over the central meanings while retaining the equivalent effect and the authenticity of a legal judgment. Furthermore, this paper is based on the author’s teaching experiences, and will refer to the syllabuses and curriculum design of the “Programme Intended Learning Outcomes” and the “Course Intended Learning Outcomes”. It demonstrates the applicable value of translation theory, and how practical translation can be taught with theoretical explanation and vice versa.Translation bases on practice, all kinds of theories area guideline to be applied.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:59:29.425288,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T20:25:06.790146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/citation/,vgf2n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4a6m9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/relationships/node/,4a6m9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59346c23594d90024fe883d3/,59346c23594d90024fe883d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vgf2n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vgf2n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vgf2n,NA
