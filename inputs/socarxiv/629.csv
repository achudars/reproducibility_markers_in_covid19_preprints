Theoretical models suggest that cultural variation among ethnic groups can be maintained if inter-ethnic interaction is curtailed, or if groups are balanced in size and prestige. However, inter-ethnic interaction often takes place between members of groups that differ in size and prestige, as well as in power. We construct a model to examine the effects of ethnic asymmetries in inter-ethnic coordination benefits on changes in the frequency of cultural norms in a population comprising minority and majority ethnic groups. In the absence of other processes, conditions favourable for the sustainability of minority culture may be broadened through establishment of a territory with a border that is permeable to members of a dis-empowered minority group, but not to members of a powerful majority. We show how model predictions can complement empirical studies of cultural change, and demonstrate the model's relevance to our understanding of norm dynamics in an indigenous Amazonian population.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|cultural evolution|ethnicity|minorities|norms|territory,2018-07-02T11:35:35.247378,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-19T14:29:00.596399,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/citation/,bpgt3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8be5z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/relationships/node/,8be5z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a61dd3c94ef6d000f614bf1/,5a61dd3c94ef6d000f614bf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bpgt3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bpgt3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bpgt3,NA

As part of its regulatory duties, the FDA provides guidance documents on various regulatory topics as mandated by the U.S. code of federal regulations. Since 2015, the FDA has begun to issue many substantial revisions to their guidance documents that directly affects the regulatory framework on biocompatibility, reprocessing, and sterilization.

These regulatory issues are of paramount importance for many companies because of the potential high costs involved in changing their internal design, controls, manufacturing, and quality systems. This master’s thesis examines the various changes made by the FDA in recent years on the inter-related topics of biocompatibility, reprocessing, and sterilization. Some of the major changes by the FDA involve an increase in the importance of chemical characterization, a reduction in the use of animal testing, a requirement for an independent validation of the user instructions for reusable devices, and increased usability testing.

The principal reasons for these major policy changes by the FDA are shown to be the major device scandals that recently involved duodenoscopes, metal-on-metal hip implants, and vaginal surgical mesh implants. Along with several other regulatory failures that made national news headlines in the United States, the FDA began to revise several of their previous medical device guidances. The information from this master’s thesis can be used by medical device developers and manufacturers, especially when they are located outside of the United States and lack sufficient regulatory affairs resources to provide independent advice and recommendations on these important FDA changes. A thorough analysis is made of the new FDA guidances to clarify several potentially difficult questions for medical device manufacturers, specifically the following: (1) ""Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process"", (2) ""Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and Labeling"", and (3) ""Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile"".

Researchers rely on these items as proxy indicators of gender inequality within households, although there are reasons to doubt decision-making is equated with power. I review relative resources and exchange theory predictions about decision-making and two potential moderators: the gender system and methods of allocating income. Using original data (n = 3,975) from a vignette-survey experiment to disentangle the mechanisms leading to decision making authority, I find higher relative earners within families are not regarded as entitled to the final word in decisions. Whether respondents considered earnings individually or community owned did not explain the lack of association between financial resources and decision-making clout. Findings show a significant association between the decider’s gender and perceptions of fairness: specifically, when women were presented as the decider over monetary family choices, unilateral decision-making was viewed more favorably. Results from the qualitative analysis of the reasoning behind these evaluations were consistent with beliefs in egalitarian essentialism, that women and men are equal but characteristically different.

Respondents were asked to select a preferred income allocation strategy for a fictional couple with varied circumstances. Findings showed that despite differences in fictional couples’ marital and parental statuses, the majority of respondents indicated all couples should ideally pursue some level of autonomy within their relationships. Respondents also believed higher-earning partners ought to hold back a greater absolute value of their income, potentially reproducing unequal labor market conditions within families. When women were presented as the primary earner, the ideal level of withholding income was slightly larger in magnitude than when men were shown as the primary earner.

Using data from Monitoring the Future surveys (1976–2015), the authors assessed three components of trends in youth’s beliefs about gender: the marketplace, the family, and mothers’ employment. Findings showed continued increases in egalitarianism from 1976 through
the mid-1990s across all three dimensions. Thereafter, support for egalitarianism in the public sphere plateaued at high levels, rising support for mothers’ employment persisted at a slower pace, and conventional ideology about gender in families returned. The changing demographic composition of American high school students did not account for the gender attitude trends. Youth’s mothers’ employment and increased education were related to increased egalitarianism. Changes in population averages of mothers’ employment and educational attainment were only weakly associated with
increases in egalitarian attitudes.",TRUE,FALSE,family dynamics|gender|gender revolution|inequality,2018-07-02T11:35:30.910128,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-17T22:46:46.393514,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Joanna Pepin; David Cotter,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/citation/,d72s3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z7quy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/relationships/node/,z7quy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5f90ccf8a0b5000df477ff/,5a5f90ccf8a0b5000df477ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d72s3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d72s3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d72s3,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12434

This article suggests the labour theory value (LTV) as an appropriate concept for embedding heterodox ideas into sociology and social policy teaching. While often seen as a relic of nineteenth century political economy, teaching LTV is beneficial as (1) it is one of few economic theories addressing causes of economic inequality and (2) the contrast with neoclassical subjective value theory (STV) facilitates discussion about relationships between different ideas of ‘value’ and conflicting political ideas about social justice. We present a series of exercises designed to introduce students to differences between STV and LTV. After running and modifying exercises over three years, we find the intervention broadly successful in encouraging students to engage with economic ideas and draw connections between personal experience, society, economics and politics.",TRUE,FALSE,economic sociology|heterodox economics|inequality|pedagogy|social policy|value theory,2018-07-02T11:35:30.775429,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-17T22:45:39.300188,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/citation/,p8bmh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k72jv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/relationships/node/,k72jv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5f7fe7ff20fa000cedb881/,5a5f7fe7ff20fa000cedb881,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p8bmh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p8bmh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p8bmh,NA

Using data newly analyzed from the National Corrections Reporting Program restricted files for 2000-2013, this report documents the higher rates of prison admissions for Whites in rural areas and shows that these higher rates are tied to the higher rates of White poverty and lower White educational levels in rural areas. Further, places with less educated White people showed more growth in White imprisonment. Poverty and education explain the urban-rural difference in a statistical sense, but this does not mean that there is no rural-urban difference. Rather, the analysis points to the high concentration of White disadvantage in rural areas and smaller cities. The Black patterns are different: although rates of poverty and high school dropouts are higher in rural areas for Blacks, the correlations are weaker than for Whites and rural areas have lower Black imprisonment rates both before and after controls for education and poverty. Looking at changes in imprisonment rates between 2000-6 and 2007-11, both Black and White imprisonment rose in areas with higher high school dropout rates and lower Black percentages, but the effects of poverty and college graduation rates and percent Hispanic varied by race in multivariate models. Overall, the findings point to the importance both of disaggregating Black and White imprisonment rates and of recognizing that overall national trends obscure marked differences in the trends between places. They also point to concentrated White disadvantage in White rural areas as linked to rising White imprisonment rates. Further research is necessary to understand these trends.",TRUE,FALSE,imprisonment rates|poverty|rural|white,2018-07-02T11:35:29.952340,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-17T14:01:47.716025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/citation/,xzq7w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x873k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/relationships/node/,x873k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a5ee684f8a0b50010f10843/,5a5ee684f8a0b50010f10843,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xzq7w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xzq7w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xzq7w,NA
