Based on in-depth interviews with 16 surgeons, drawn from qualitative research, this study reveals that surgeons subjectively construct the idea of incompetency through their understanding of the perceived circumstantial characteristics of the patients and family members. The findings largely suggest that surgeons dismiss their capacity based on constructed assessments, which leads to paternalistic practice. The findings  illustrate how these assessments structure the surgeons’ practices and provide the moral and practical justifications for their actions. The constructed knowledge becomes a source for drawing normative justification for surgeons’ actions and, in conjunction with socially enforced relationships, leads patients and family members to be on the receiving end of disrespectful attitudes. By  employing the ethical framework, this paper argues for physicians to pursue “respect for persons,” beyond the framework of “capacity/autonomy,” and to practice respect in hospital settings.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-11T14:12:21.909291,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-11T14:11:54.975812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/citation/,nhdrv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/auxz2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/relationships/node/,auxz2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0f593d9cdb9f00186611a8/,5c0f593d9cdb9f00186611a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nhdrv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nhdrv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nhdrv,NA

Young adults of Generation Y are found to drive less and, in some contexts, are found to exhibit more multimodal travel patterns and to use public transit more often. Potential causes for these observed shifts in transport mode use have also been theorised: One view is that period effects in the form of contemporaneous changes in socio-cultural, socio-economic and socio-technical factors are responsible for the observed shifts in transport mode use; another view is that members of Generation Y have inherently different preferences and values due to formative socio-cultural, socio-economic and historical experiences. Motivated by this yet-to-be-resolved dialectic, this paper uses a hierarchical Bayesian multivariate Poisson log-normal model to examine intergenerational differences in transport mode use among young adults. The model is applied to 23 waves of the German Mobility Panel and captures between-cohort and between-period variation of parameters of interest. The trained model informs a counterfactual prediction exercise aiming to decompose intergenerational differences in transport mode use into demography-, cohort-, and period-specific effects. Our findings suggest that all three sets of effects account for intergenerational differences in transport mode use, while the absolute and relative importance of each set of effects vary across transport modes. For the period from 1998 to 2016, two thirds of the decline in car use can be ascribed to period effects; nearly all of the increase in public transit use and 42% of the increase in bicycling can be ascribed to cohort effects.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-12-11T02:39:02.176135,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-11T02:38:41.015574,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Rico Krueger 2018,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/citation/,unezy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rhqgv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/relationships/node/,rhqgv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0f1fe19cdb9f001966693c/,5c0f1fe19cdb9f001966693c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unezy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/unezy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/unezy,NA

presidents could guarantee their influence over Supreme Courts’ 
decisions provided that presidents nominate at least half of the
bench. I argue, however, that this is not always the case, as 
in some courts, individual justices have primacy over the collective
body. I develop a model that states that the control of the agenda 
power by individual justices is a determinant factor for understanding
judicial independence. The Brazilian Supreme Court serves as a good
case, as there are several institutional rules that allow each 
justice to pause or change the result of a judgment, without consulting
his or her peers. My research design focuses on three cases studies of
the court and 3,043 decisions, which I analyze using matching. Results show
that, when the government has a strong interest in a particular 
lawsuit, the probability of this lawsuit being halted by a Supreme
Court justice is higher. The fact that presidents can influence
individual justices, and in turn these justices can affect the
course of a lawsuit, sheds new light on the role that judicial 
independence has when considering presidents’ influence over Supreme Court decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazilian Supreme Court|Judicial Independence|Judicial Politics,2018-12-11T00:33:26.493450,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-11T00:33:00.774009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/citation/,by3sw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7mwrv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/relationships/node/,7mwrv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0e59049cdb9f0016679950/,5c0e59049cdb9f0016679950,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/by3sw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/by3sw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/by3sw,NA

The paper develops a set of theoretical tools for articulating formal elements of action that make alienation possible, without giving conceptual priority to alienation in the sphere of production, or within that sphere to the alienation of labor. These tools make it possible to derive classical notions of alienation as specific, contingent combinations of multiple elements, theorizing them as concrete socio-historical configurations of a broader universe of possibilities. They also organize systematic reflection on various forms and relations of alienation; not only those between for instance labor and capital, but also among all four factors of production: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.

Therefore, the computational complexity is significantly increased since cardinality constraints have a direct influence on the portfolio size. In order to overcome arising computational difficulties, for solving this problem, researchers have focused on investigating efficient solution algorithms such as metaheuristic algorithms since exact techniques may be inadequate to find an optimal solution in a reasonable time and are computationally ineffective when applied to large-scale problems. In this paper, our purpose is to present an efficient solution approach based on an artificial bee colony algorithm with feasibility enforcement and infeasibility toleration procedures for solving cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the solution methodology. In this study, the ABC-I algorithm and the ABC-II algorithm, which are the modern meta-innovative models for solving optimization problems, have been used to optimize the investment portfolio with the goal of increasing returns and reducing risk. Of the 591 companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange, 150 companies were selected during the period from 2014 to 2018 using a systematic elimination method with limitation as the final sample.

World leaders had agreed that increased transparency was urgently needed to help shore up national fiscal systems and alleviate social injustices. These new rules have wide-ranging economic and political consequences for the regulation of global wealth chains (GWCs). Tax transparency is a key factor in the level of information asymmetry between wealth chain ‘insiders’, such as corporations and tax advisers, and ‘outsiders’, such as tax authorities and civil society activists. This chapter discusses the ‘technicisation’ of the OECD policy process to define these new requirements, i.e. the embedding of highly political discussions in a specialised, expertise-intensive policy context. Technicisation constrained the post-crisis political momentum for expanded transparency of corporate wealth chains, but also helped normalize the idea of increased transparency as ‘risk assessment’ within the policy community. The chapter highlights three key dynamics of technicisation: policy insulation, re-framing and appropriateness judgments. Evidence is drawn from a qualitative content analysis of documents in the OECD policy debates on corporate tax transparency, and interviews with select informants involved in the policy process.",TRUE,FALSE,Expertise|Global wealth chains|OECD|Tax|Transparency,2018-12-07T12:52:06.924704,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-07T12:51:37.750703,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/citation/,xkewa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wf5j7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/relationships/node/,wf5j7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0a649da9b99c0018175b40/,5c0a649da9b99c0018175b40,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkewa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xkewa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xkewa,NA

Field evidence for two paths to cross-cultural competence: implications for cultural dynamics. Evolutionary Human Sciences 2, e3, 1–16. https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2020.1             Interaction between members of culturally-distinct (ethnic) groups is an important driver of the evolutionary dynamics of human culture, yet the relevant mechanisms remain under-explored. For example, cultural loss resulting from integration with culturally-distinct immigrants or colonial majority populations remains a topic whose political salience exceeds our understanding of mechanisms that may drive or impede it. For such dynamics, one mediating factor is the ability to interact successfully across cultural boundaries (cross-cultural competence). However, measurement difficulties often hinder its investigation. Here, simple field methods in a uniquely-suited Amazonian population and Bayesian item-response theory models are used to derive the first experience-level measure of cross-cultural competence, as well as evidence for two developmental paths: Cross-cultural competence may emerge as a side effect of adopting out-group cultural norms, or it may be acquired while maintaining in-group norms. Ethnographic evidence suggests that the path taken is a likely consequence of power differences in inter- versus intra-group interaction. The former path, paralleling language extinction, can lead to cultural loss; the latter to cultural sustainability. Recognition of such path-dependent effects is vital both to theory of cultural dynamics in humans and perhaps other species, and to effective policy promoting cultural diversity and constructive inter-ethnic interaction.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|Cross-cultural competence|Ethnicity|Indigenous peoples|Intercultural competence|Item Response Theory|multiculturalism|Norms,2018-12-07T12:59:01.976102,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-07T12:58:22.656524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d53|Education|Indigenous Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dae|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Multicultural Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/citation/,468ns,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gjuzv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/relationships/node/,gjuzv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c098bdba9b99c001a166dfb/,5c098bdba9b99c001a166dfb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/468ns/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/468ns/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/468ns,NA
