There is a huge volume of translation between English and Arabic for legal texts such as contracts of various types, wills, articles of association, lawsuits, to name but a few. Notwithstanding the pitfalls of translation between English and Arabic in general, translating legal texts poses certain challenges of critical implications. Such challenges can be attributed to the difference in the structure of the legal texts, types of legal texts, and, most importantly, the difference in the legal system between the Arab countries on the one hand and the English-speaking countries on the other. The present paper aims to discuss the lack of uniformity in legal translation, differences within the same legal system and the translator’s lack of familiarity with legal terms. It also aims to highlight certain challenges such as the contextual meaning and connotative meaning.",TRUE,FALSE,connotation and denotation|different legal systems|familiarity|uniformity,2018-07-02T11:54:44.693389,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-05T13:25:26.551680,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/citation/,mk2db,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bhkmn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/relationships/node/,bhkmn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b160343eca4a80010bcc312/,5b160343eca4a80010bcc312,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mk2db/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mk2db/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.14,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mk2db

Recently, however, many researchers (Witte, Harden &amp; Ramos de Oliveira Harden, 2009; Cook, 2010; Leonardi, 2010; Malmkjaer, 2010) have questioned the outright dismissal of translation from the foreign language classroom and called for reassessing its role. Moreover, they welcomed it as a fifth skill alongside reading, writing, listening, and speaking that learners need in their learning and future careers. This paper argues for the rehabilitation of translation in the teaching and learning of foreign languages. It attempts to give a panorama of the revival of translation. So, it first reconsiders its dismissal in the method era and then it summarises the literature on its revival in the 21st century. The review of literature has revealed that the onslaught against translation was illegitimate and that the literature in favour of it is a reputable, a recent, and an abundant one.",TRUE,FALSE,fifth skill|foreign language classroom|the revival|translation,2018-07-02T11:54:44.659890,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-06T11:45:36.981084,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/citation/,u3zrq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q9zv8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/relationships/node/,q9zv8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b160266a291c400103a197a/,5b160266a291c400103a197a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3zrq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u3zrq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u3zrq

Recently, some members of academia have argued that no methodology exists to study excess deaths attributable to climate disasters. This study uses death records for Puerto Rico between 1990 and 1998 to assess excess deaths following Hurricane Georges by comparing death counts for 1998 with patterns of variation from the previous eight years. Because no population shift occurred in that decade, other than expected ones based on historical information, the average number of deaths is indicative of expected deaths and the confidence intervals are the ranges of accepted variation. If a count following a climate disaster exceeds the upper limit of the confidence interval these deaths could be considered above the historical ranges of variation and this excess could be associated with the climate disaster of interest. Death counts for September-November 1998 indicate that 819 deaths were in excess of historical ranges of variation. When the year in which Hurricane Hortense is excluded from the construction of the ranges of variation, the excess is 945 deaths. A total of 811 or 937 are missing in comparison to the official death count for this Hurricane. Considering that death counts data structures are comparable across the countries of the world, this method can be used to analyze the effect of other climate disasters.",TRUE,FALSE,Excess Deaths|Hurricane Georges|Mortality|Official Statistics|Puerto Rico|Statistical Methods,2018-07-02T11:54:44.470236,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-05T00:44:10.676355,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Alexis R.

Regarding comparisons, there are two different objectives: they may be known and unknown in the target language. The objectives become a translation problem according to different languages, cultures, attitudes and other aspects. This study aimed to investigate the translation techniques used for transferring live metaphors found in a novel into Thai, namely, Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2005) and its translated version. The translation strategies were studied and analyzed. The analysis relied on the model of Newmark (1988) which proposed seven techniques for metaphor translation. The results of this research showed that the most frequently technique employed was the source metaphor that can be reproduced as the same image in target language, with a total of fifty-seven sentences out of one hundred thirty-six sentences. Additionally, there were also three techniques that were often applied: the metaphor can be translated as a simile by adding some meaning or translating a metaphor as a metaphor and plus some meaning or explanation and the metaphor can be deleted when it is redundant. It can be inferred that to maintain the native sense of language and prevent reader’s confusion, the translator provided the equivalent or same image in the target language. Therefore, the author avoided deleting the source image and instead converted it to literal language.",TRUE,FALSE,live metaphor|metaphor|source language|source text|target text|translation|translation strategy,2018-07-02T11:54:44.339769,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:36:42.403574,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/citation/,b6mv8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/684mp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/relationships/node/,684mp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b157d3af1f288000d65fe11/,5b157d3af1f288000d65fe11,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b6mv8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b6mv8/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b6mv8

This study aims to find a Western fiction formula and look for new things that may appear in the novel Touch of Texas as a Western novel. Taking the original convention of Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales, this study also looks for the invention and convention of Touch of Texas by using Cawelti’s formula theory. The study finds that Garrett's Touch of Texas not only features a natural malignancy against civilization, a ranger as a single hero, and a love story, but also shows an element of revenge and the other side of a neglected minority life. A hero or ranger in this story comes from a minority group, a mixture of white blood and Indians. The romance story also shows a different side. The woman in the novel is not the only one to be saved, but a Ranger is too, especially from the wounds and ridicule of the population as a ranger of mixed blood.

Eliot’s The Cocktail Party, were very eventful in European drama. In those years, a completely new dramatic movement – the spread of naturalistic prose drama – came into play. On the other hand, verse drama in the twentieth century, and particularly in England and Ireland, came back into the popular theater. At the hands of W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot and Christopher Fry, in the main, the dramatists who constituted the chief revolt against naturalism, contemporary verse drama revived against the naturalistic definition of drama, which in a sense considers characterization and action the main ends of drama. The aim of the paper is to compare and contrast the two styles of drama using the criticism of contemporary verse dramatists. The paper delves into the ways these dramatists tried to make verse play and distinguish themselves from naturalists. It continues to prove their failure while showing discontinuity of verse plays’ popularity in the temporary audience’s mind. The question is whether verse dramatists succeeded in instilling a feeling of suspense and popularity in the inner recesses of the audience’s hearts or not; in other words, can verse drama preserve its influence on the audience? The significance of this study is to prove that although the role of verse drama lasted for centuries, its presence nowadays is vanishing as it is losing its power of influence.",TRUE,FALSE,and symbolism|Contemporary verse drama|mystification|naturalism|poetic drama|prose drama|religious plays|verse drama,2018-07-02T11:54:44.206779,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:35:25.261353,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/citation/,d8zub,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9w5z7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/relationships/node/,9w5z7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b15778764f25a000f76ff96/,5b15778764f25a000f76ff96,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d8zub/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d8zub

It also aims at providing some practical ideas and methods regarding the use of short stories by inquiring about the following questions: What significance can be accorded to the use of short stories in EFL classroom and how can short stories serve as a mediator between the learner’s own culture and other cultures? To address these questions, a questionnaire was collected from 95 third year undergraduate students at Mostaganem University, 24 of the students were selected randomly for an intervention that lasted about 8 weeks. Findings from the questionnaire and experimental study indicate that the study population does not only show positive attitudes towards short stories reading but also manifests a number of signs that reflect their acquisition of cultural issues, they also support the usefulness of examining learners’ cultural knowledge, feelings and experiences before, while and after bringing short stories into the literature class. Therefore, it is recommended to use short stories as a primary motivational reading material to stimulate students’ cultural awareness and their reading envy.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural diversity|culture|identity|motivation|short stories,2018-07-02T11:54:44.175199,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:35:11.872013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/citation/,9bp7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t8fq3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/relationships/node/,t8fq3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b15768664f25a001076c703/,5b15768664f25a001076c703,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bp7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9bp7t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9bp7t

The study surveyed 50 female translation students of the Translation Program at Prince Sultan University, Saudi Arabia. The survey consisted of questions about knowledge and use patterns and included texts for translating between English and Arabic. Results show that although the students know and use a variety of online resources, they still lack in awareness of some of the very useful ones, and a small minority of the students does not use monolingual dictionaries at all. Analysis of the students’ translations of selected terms reveals that availability of excellent online resources is not enough to prevent mistranslations if the students cannot select the right equivalent. The study has implications for lexicographers about the dictionary features most frequently used by translators-to-be. It also provides pedagogical tips for translator trainers who should guide their students to making use of the full potential of online dictionaries and term banks in order to achieve better translation outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,|CAT tools|online dictionaries|term base|terminology data banks,2018-07-02T11:54:44.142097,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:34:57.964403,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/citation/,b8c7j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hwa9m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/relationships/node/,hwa9m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b157549f1f288000e64647f/,5b157549f1f288000e64647f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8c7j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8c7j/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8c7j
