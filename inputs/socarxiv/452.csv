These participatory projects can be seen as a way to check the pervasive and potentially undemocratic role of expertise in society, by creating a public setting in which experts’ advice can be exposed and criticized, and in which laypeople can attempt to influence policy processes that would ordinarily be dominated by experts. This ethnographic study investigates the fine-grained human interactions as members of a New York City community board in a low-income neighborhood engage land use and housing issues. It finds that they can partially overcome the challenge of expertise by developing their own technical capacity, and that this enhances board members’ influence. But it also finds that members encounter difficulties that cannot be remedied by more technical capacity. First, board members who develop expertise still lack complementary instrumentalities, such as access to insider information. And second, they find it difficult to juggle performance of their expert role with other roles they must play in their deliberations, especially the role of representing the community, which is essential if they are to influence elected officials through public opinion.",TRUE,FALSE,Housing|Neighborhoods|Participation|Urban politics,2018-11-05T19:47:41.264941,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-05T19:47:30.567808,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/citation/,fwt59,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z7pje/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/relationships/node/,z7pje,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be0646f5736490019859534/,5be0646f5736490019859534,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fwt59/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fwt59/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fwt59,NA

Genomic research allows new discoveries to alleviate human suffering but in turn raises significant ethical issues. In this context, public acceptance and engagement is a major determinant of optimization of genomic research. Therefore, understanding public perspectives related to genomic research is imperative, as it provides a foundation to address ethical issues which may be unknown to researchers and other stakeholders. Although genomic medicine and research has developed in Sri Lanka during the past decade, there is a paucity of understanding about public knowledge and attitudes towards it. 
Methods
This research, therefore, aims to explore the understanding, knowledge and attitudes of a Sri Lankan public towards genomic medicine and research, in order to consider more effective and appropriate ways of communicating about the risks and benefits of participating in genomic research. Twenty four participants will be purposively selected from a previously conducted Colombo Twin and Singleton follow-up study (COTASS-2). In-depth qualitative interviews with a semi structured topic guide will be used to collect data, which will be analysed using conventional content analysis.
Discussion
This study is the first of its kind to explore public perspectives towards genomic medicine and research in Sri Lanka.

A longitudinal study,"Violent ideations are increasingly recognized as an important psychological process involved in aggressive and violent behavior. However, little is known about the processes that contribute to violent ideations. This paper therefore examines the effects of dispositional and situational factors on violent ideations during late adolescence. More specifically, it examines the extent to which violent victimization triggers violent ideations. Furthermore, it examines whether effects of violent victimization on violent ideations differ by gender. This study uses data from two waves of the Zurich Project on the Social Development from Childhood into Adulthood (z-proso; n= 1,465). Full-information maximum likelihood regressions are used to regress violent ideations at age 17 on social and psychological characteristics measured at age 15 and reports of previous year violent victimization measured at age 17. The results show that violent ideations at age 17 are strongly influenced by violent thoughts, aggressive behavior, violent media consumption, moral neutralization of violence, and internalizing symptoms measured at age 15. Moreover, victimization experiences increase the likelihood of violent ideations over and above pre-existing dispositions and prior violent ideations.

Despite this centrality, the exact definition of a neighborhood, as well as how and where to draw its boundaries, has remained unclear. And while these questions have generated significant academic debate, they have arguably little effect on people’s everyday lives or decision-making processes. Atlanta, Georgia represents a different case, however, because of the city’s system of ‘neighborhood planning units’ (NPU), which has shaped the city’s planning and political processes since the mid-1970s. But despite significant changes within the city’s intra-urban geography since the 1970s, the geography of the NPU system has remained largely unchanged.

As such, this paper attempts to harness the potentials of big data to rethink the nature and geographies of Atlanta’s neighborhoods. Drawing on archival documents, historic maps of the city’s neighborhoods and new sources of big data, this paper explores the evolution of Atlanta’s neighborhoods from the 1960s up to the present day. In particular, our analysis highlights the fundamentally fuzzy, fluid and relational nature of neighborhoods, both in the ways neighborhoods are defined by political and administrative entities and through the everyday lives of residents. Ultimately, this work calls into question the idea of the neighborhood as a natural, pre-existing, discrete and static spatial unit, and points to the utility of using new sources of data and analytical techniques for revealing this underlying relationality.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|neighborhoods|spatial theory|urban geography,2018-11-04T15:15:41.217171,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-04T15:15:24.032283,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/citation/,vmrnf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/p9w2b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/relationships/node/,p9w2b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd206f38b33000019201f9f/,5bd206f38b33000019201f9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vmrnf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vmrnf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vmrnf,NA

While the smart citizen is most often seen as a kind of foil for those more stereotypically top-down, neoliberal, and repressive visions of the smart city that have been widely critiqued within the literature, this paper argues for an attention to the ‘actually existing smart citizen’, which plays a much messier and more ambivalent role in practice. This paper proposes the dual figures of ‘the general citizen’ and ‘the absent citizen’ as a heuristic for thinking about how the lines of inclusion and exclusion are drawn for citizens, both discursively and materially, in the actual making of the smart city. These figures are meant to highlight how the universal and unspecified figure of ‘the citizen’ is discursively deployed to justify smart city policies, while at the same time, actual citizens remain largely excluded from such decision and policy-making processes. Using a case study of Atlanta, Georgia and its ongoing smart cities initiatives, we argue that while the participation of citizens is crucial to any truly democratic mode of urban governance, the emerging discourse around the promise of smart citizenship fails to capture the realities of how citizens are actually discussed and enrolled in the making of these policies.",TRUE,FALSE,smart cities|urban geography|urban planning,2018-11-04T15:20:44.326109,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-04T15:20:18.767868,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/citation/,6fcet,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gp5vy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/relationships/node/,gp5vy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0dfaa40f461a000cb95084/,5b0dfaa40f461a000cb95084,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6fcet/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6fcet/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6fcet,NA

Unlike in traditional offshore outsourcing, service providers are predominantly one-person microproviders located in emerging-economy countries not necessarily associated with offshoring and often disadvantaged by negative country images. How do these microproviders survive and thrive? We theorize global platforms through transaction cost economics (TCE), arguing that they are a new technology-enabled offshoring institution that emerges in response to cross-border information asymmetries that hitherto prevented microproviders from participating in offshoring markets. To explain how platforms achieve this, we adapt signaling theory to a TCE-based model and test our hypotheses by analyzing 6 months of transaction records from a leading platform. To help interpret the results and generalize them beyond a single platform, we introduce supplementary data from 107 face-to-face interviews with microproviders in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals choose microprovidership when it provides a better return on their skills and labor than employment at a local (offshoring) firm. The platform acts as a signaling environment that allows microproviders to inform foreign clients of their quality, with platform-generated signals being the most informative signaling type. Platform signaling disproportionately benefits emerging-economy providers, allowing them to partly overcome the effects of negative country images and thus diminishing the importance of home country institutions. Global platforms in other factor and product markets likely promote cross-border microbusiness through similar mechanisms.",TRUE,FALSE,developing countries|freelancing|gig economy|international management|online labour market|online labour platforms|selection/staffing|transaction cost economics,2018-11-02T17:10:25.454647,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-02T17:09:09.309329,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/citation/,jt4z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8d276/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/relationships/node/,8d276,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdc704f2a8be80019e21e8a/,5bdc704f2a8be80019e21e8a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jt4z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jt4z7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jt4z7,https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206318786781

Drawing upon research related to listening practices, this study operationalizes for empirical study Dobson’s (2014) normative concepts of apophatic listening, which is dialogic and facilitates discussion across lines of difference, and cataphatic listening, which is monologic and disruptive in nature. Using data from a national sample survey of Latinos fielded shortly after the 2016 U.S. presidential election (N = 720), we provide an empirical test of these listening practices’ democratic value by examining how relational and analytical listening (dimensions of apophatic practices) and task-oriented and critical listening (dimensions of cataphatic practices) are associated with various political outcomes, including political interest, knowledge, trust, and participation. Findings indicate that, from a normative point of view, task-oriented listening was unrelated or negatively related to political outcomes while relational listening had ambivalent relations. However, the two cognitive-epistemic dimensions of both types of listening – analytical listening and critical (error-seeking) listening – were both strongly and positively related to most studied political outcomes. These findings offer nuanced evidence that apophatic and cataphatic listening might not necessarily be at odds with each other where democratically desirable outcomes are concerned.",TRUE,FALSE,deliberation|democratic theory|listening|normative analysis|political behavior|political communication|political psychology|political talk,2018-11-02T11:24:04.887222,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-02T11:23:42.064167,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/citation/,rghk2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/aqk6d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/relationships/node/,aqk6d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdc32159764d200195ae971/,5bdc32159764d200195ae971,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rghk2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rghk2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rghk2,NA

For the sake of brevity, focus is mainly placed on the first season whose twelve episodes shed light on some of the major issues Muslims, German Muslims, and Turks together with Germans, are faced with when fate brings them together in so cosmopolitan a city as Berlin. With this in the background, it goes without saying that much of the scriptwriter’s personal life is brought to bear on his creation of an ethno-comedy intriguing enough to follow and retrace. This study aims at explicating the ways in which friction leads to the perception and the construction of Muslim Other within the gates as riddled with stereotypes. By deconstructing the stereotypical, the researchers seek to demonstrate how humour can be used to dispel and subvert clichés, thus creating a culture of resistance.",TRUE,FALSE,construction|deconstructing|humour|Muslim|Other|resistance|stereotypes,2019-07-25T18:46:04.398749,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T18:45:34.474403,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/citation/,xps39,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x5ev4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/relationships/node/,x5ev4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bdbcd0d9764d2001b589de1/,5bdbcd0d9764d2001b589de1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xps39/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xps39/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xps39,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no4.19
