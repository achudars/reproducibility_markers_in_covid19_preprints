Children from minority ethnic groups are, on average, 17% less likely to be admitted into their top-ranked secondary school, compared to white children. This gap is large even after controlling for socio-economic status and prior attainment. However, constraints on the length of preference lists mean that stated preferences may not be truthful, as parents may have incentives to strategise by excluding preferred schools. By accounting for strategic stated preferences and biased beliefs about chances of admission, this paper recovers parametric estimates of preference parameters and the degree of strategic selection. To examine the relative contribution of geographic sorting, strategies, and market design (mechanism and admission rules), the corrected revealed preference estimates are used to estimate expected welfare under three scenarios. The analysis reveals that both underlying preferences and strategising behaviour exhibit substantial heterogeneity by ethnicity, income and ability. When comparing welfare, I find that differences in admissions priority between white and minority ethnic families create small but significant and consistent differences in welfare. However, larger welfare differences are due to differences in preferences and strategy between the two groups.",TRUE,FALSE,manipulable mechanism|preference estimation|school admissions|school choice,2019-04-23T20:45:01.302869,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23T20:44:45.111145,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/citation/,bj6gr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf2cb0d9de1100207eff30/,5cbf2cb0d9de1100207eff30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bj6gr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bj6gr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bj6gr,NA

Nearly three decades ago, the Austrian government deployed special accommodations to handle a similarly sized influx of refugees entering Europe, individuals and families who were fleeing ethnic cleansing from the Bosnian War. These accommodations, and their eventual economic integration components, provide longitudinal data that indicates a system that allowed employment rates of Bosnian refugees to match the rate of host country populations within a generation. 
Through thematic analysis of an extensive literature review and field consultations in Vienna, this research will investigate what lessons the global community can learn from Austria’s treatment of Bosnians refugees, and whether these lessons can contribute to improved procedures for integrating refugees into host societies. Preliminary results indicate the role of social capital, civil society, and religion as factors of labor market integration, while also acknowledging rates of underemployment and stagnation in the asylum process as deterrents to positive relationship formation between host societies and refugee populations.

The rise of the Women’s March as a massive effort to mobilize women primarily on the basis of gender coincided with calls for it to pay greater attention to intersectionality. This study considers the effectiveness of the Women’s March at using intersectional activism as a collective action frame. Drawing on surveys conducted at Women’s March events in five cities and four other Washington, DC activist events in 2018, this study examines the extent to which activists think that the movements should place a priority on intersectional activism. The results show that participants in Women’s March events were more supportive of prioritizing intersectional activism than were activists at comparable protest events that were not mobilized using intersectional collective action frames. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that ideology may be a barrier to embracing intersectional activism, with more moderate and conservative activists placing a lower priority on intersectionality than did more liberal activists.

However, we know little about the political orientation of professors in comparison to other professionals, which would be the right comparison group if we want to know whether universities are potentially hostile environments to conservatives. Examining culturally and economically oriented political orientations in Europe, it is demonstrated that professors are more liberal and left-leaning than other professionals. However, there is no greater homogeneity of political orientations among the professoriate relative to other specific professions, suggesting that there is a diversity of opinions which is similar to what professionals would find in other occupations. One exception concerns attitudes towards immigration, on which professors have more liberal orientations and comparatively low residual variance around that more liberal mean.

Studies have paid little attention to independent mechanisms that reduce emissions. Statistical properties of the data undermine the estimation techniques used in many studies. To address these shortcomings, we used novel methods and panel data integrating emissions, economic, and energy-system characteristics across 70 economies over 1970-2013 to derive a universal GDP-emissions relationship and identify key emissions-reduction mechanisms. We found that, robust to a variety of estimation procedures, every 1% increase in GDP was associated with a 1% increase in CO2 emissions when controlling for other mechanisms. Emissions reductions were mainly driven by four mechanisms: (i) energy system decarbonization, (ii) increased economic efficiency, (iii) electrification, and (iv) deindustrialization. A 1% increase in these factors was associated with 0.2-1.8% reductions in CO2 emissions per year; together, these factors contributed to 18 petagrams of emissions reduction globally over 1970-2013.

Public Management meets Public Sector Machine Learning,"Public bodies and agencies increasingly seek to use new forms of data analysis in order to provide 'better public services'. These reforms have consisted of digital service transformations generally aimed at 'improving the experience of the citizen', 'making government more efficient' and 'boosting business and the wider economy'. More recently however, there has been a push to use administrative data to build algorithmic models, often using machine learning, to help make day-to-day operational decisions in the management and delivery of public services rather than providing general policy evidence. This chapter asks several questions relating to this. What are the drivers of these new approaches? Is public sector machine learning a smooth continuation of e-Government, or does it pose fundamentally different challenge to practices of public administration? And how are public management decisions and practices at different levels enacted when machine learning solutions are implemented in the public sector? Focussing on different levels of government: the macro, the meso, and the 'street-level', we map out and analyse the current efforts to frame and standardise machine learning in the public sector, noting that they raise several concerns around the skills, capacities, processes and practices governments currently employ.

Despite significant impacts on occupational choice, income, and health in the first year, after five years we see nearly complete convergence across all groups and outcomes. Short run increases in productivity and earnings from the grant dissipate as recipients exit their micro-enterprises. Adverse effects of factory work on health found after one year also appear to be temporary. These results suggest that one-time and one-dimensional interventions may struggle to overcome barriers to wage- or self-employment.",TRUE,FALSE,cash transfers|development|economics|employment|entrepeneurship|factories|field experiment|poverty|wage labor,2019-04-19T20:51:08.169889,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T20:50:09.719388,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Chris Blattman|Stefan Dercon|and Simon Franklin,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/citation/,zrqe4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cba311ba3bc97001af2fee4/,5cba311ba3bc97001af2fee4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrqe4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zrqe4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zrqe4,NA

Such shortest-paths are time-dependent and not always stable from one moment to the next. Given that actual transit passengers necessarily have imperfect information about the system, their route selection strategies are heuristic and cannot be expected to achieve optimal travel times for all possible departures. Thus an algorithm that returns optimal travel times at all moments will tend to underestimate real travel times all else being equal. While several researchers have noted this issue none have yet measured the extent of the problem. This study observes and measures this effect by contrasting two alternative heuristic routing strategies to a standard shortest-path calculation. The Toronto Transit Commission is used as a case study and we model actual transit operations for the agency over the course of a normal week with archived AVL data transformed into a retrospective GTFS dataset. Travel times are estimated using two alternative route-choice assumptions: 1) habitual selection of the itinerary with the best average travel time and 2) dynamic choice of the next-departing route in a predefined choice set.  It is shown that most trips present passengers with a complex choice among competing itineraries and that the choice of itinerary at any given moment of departure may entail substantial travel time risk relative to the optimal outcome. In the context of accessibility modelling, where travel times are typically considered as a distribution, the optimal path method is observed in aggregate to underestimate travel time by about 3-4 minutes at the median and 6-7 minutes at the \nth{90} percentile for a typical trip.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|modelling|public transport|route-choice|Toronto Transit Commission|transit|transportation|travel|travel behaviour,2019-04-19T20:49:27.855992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T20:48:58.370921,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Nate Wessel &amp; Steven Farber,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/citation/,3r4p6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/aud86/,aud86,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cba2daaf2be3c00170b8832/,5cba2daaf2be3c00170b8832,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3r4p6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3r4p6,NA
