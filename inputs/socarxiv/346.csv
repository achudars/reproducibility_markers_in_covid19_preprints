It also highlights the viewpoints of some scholars about tests in different regions of the world; the Middle East and the West. The content of the research embedded in this article shows that there are a number of teachers who still believe in teaching to test following the traditional method, while some others think tests -especially in the elementary phase- cause anxiety, chaos and disappointment, and should be ruled out as a means of assessing students. In the Arab World, tests are still considered the main criterion by which students prove eligible to move to upper classes and get admitted to university programs. To provide the readers with a more concrete grasp of the discussed viewpoints, a questionnaire has been distributed among sixty-five male and female students taking English courses in the Foundation Program at Ibri College of Applied Sciences- the Sultanate of Oman.

The findings also reveal that the last strategy of the classification scheme, adjuncts to refusals, was not found in the data. Similarly, not all the indirect refusal sub-strategies were found in the data. However, two novel sub-strategies: giving advice/explanation, and lack of empathy were found in the analysis.

During the pilot study, the researcher analyzed fifty translated passages from students' assignments. The aim of this systematic analysis was necessary to build a list of their most frequent errors. Besides, a checklist was used to determine students’ level of awareness of these errors. As a result, a program based on some metacognitive strategies was developed to raise students’ awareness of syntactic and semantic errors to improve their translation performance. Metacognition awareness went through five stages of preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and expansion. Students worked together in the process of translation to translate the given passages. They worked in pairs to proofread their translation by identifying their errors, correcting them, and finally editing their final copy. A pre-post translation test was developed to assess students’ translation performance. Data obtained from the test was dealt statistically with SPSS software.

Two groups were enrolled in this experiment, 20 ESP students in the experimental group and the same number in the control group. To determine if the intensive reading strategy had an impact on ESP student's in developing vocabulary, a pre-posttest was administered for both groups. The control group was treated by the traditional way of teaching vocabulary through translating the words in Arabic language and memorizing them with the help of the teacher, while the experimental group was treated by using intensive reading strategy for about ten weeks. The chosen texts were taken from (New Head way Pre-intermediate student's book). Fill in the blank exercises had been chosen in the pre-posttest which consist of 50 items for each, the test was administered by the researcher. Based on the findings of this research, it was found that the new strategy has a positive impact on ESP College students' in mastering vocabulary that was proven from the improvement of students’ mean score from pretest to posttest.

The data are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively with the aim of finding the most frequent responses that denote refusal by the English native speakers. Most of the expressions used to reflect the British people’s annoyance with the use of cold calls, the majority being brief phrases of refusal. In addition to the recorded calls, two questionnaires were conducted in Britain to shed light on the frequent expressions used on the phone in response to the salesperson. It is interesting here to catalog the range of strategies used by individuals, most of the time verbal, to avoid talking to the salesperson.

Based on the error-analysis carried out by recent research, subject–verb agreement (SVA) is one of the most frequent errors committed by students. To overcome this problem, teachers should significantly improve students’ mastery of SVA in the English language through effective teaching methods. Therefore, this research was conducted to explore the effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in teaching SVA among rural Sarawak learners. In this study, 35 Form 4 students were selected from a secondary school in the Belaga District, Sarawak as the research participants.

This ethnographic case study aims to examine the material resources and concrete activities of a group of Saudi female undergraduates majoring in English Translation in a university in Saudi Arabia as they use English on social media. This study particularly aims to answer this research question: What material resources and concrete activities do Saudi female undergraduates employ as they read and write in English on social media? A total of eleven female Saudi undergraduates took part in this research. Online observation, focus group interviewing, semi-structured interviews, informal conversations and online logbook of English usage were employed over a three-months period to collect data. This study draws on Literacy Studies (LS), that understand literacies as social practices involving more than technical skills. Analysing the data thematically revealed that these undergraduates drew on three main approaches: English-spelling checking approaches, English grammar-checking approaches and English-meaning checking approaches.

Yet, to attain such skills, teachers need to reshape their teaching practices to be in conformity with the principles of modern education that champion active learning methodologies. The present paper argues for the necessity of rethinking the traditional teacher-centered methods in teaching English literature in the Algerian context as they tend to reduce students’ active participatory roles in learning. In response to this, a number of suggestions have accordingly been put forward to enable students reach more independency in dealing with literature.
