How Strong Norms in Organizations Relate to Contractors' Cultural Integration,"Despite evidence that contract workers are often tightly integrated into organizations' work routines and processes, researchers still do not understand when contractors might be more or less culturally integrated with their organizations. How do the prevailing cultural norms in organizations relate to contract workers' cultural integration? It is unclear whether strong norms are conducive to culturally integrating both regular employees and contractors, workers who may have different cultural preferences, and who differ in status as full versus provisional organizational members. Using data from an employer review website, we examine how norm strength in organizations relates to both contractors' and regular employees' cultural integration. While regular employees exhibit more integration in organizations with stronger norms, we find that norm strength is associated with less integration among contractors, specifically those doing more independent jobs. We also examine whether strong collaborative and strong hierarchical norms appear conducive to integrating contractors versus regular employees. The results have implications for the returns to contracting in organizations, and suggest that organizational cultures face trade-offs in integrating workers across different employment arrangements.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-29T21:32:01.878722,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-29T21:31:52.691108,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/citation/,cxrjy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e08a59e1a65e9004971b1e4/,5e08a59e1a65e9004971b1e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cxrjy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cxrjy

I suggest that patterns of media coverage inform public consciousness and collective emotion. Newsworthiness and gatekeeping theories assert that school or prejudicial shootings and those with more victims are reported on at higher rates. Literature on racial and immigrant bias in media demonstrates that non-white shooters also generate more discourse. The directed construction of shootings and the affective public responses they generate align well with the concept of a “moral panic.” Using all valid cases from the Mother Jones Mass Shootings:1982-2019 dataset which align temporally with Google Trends data, I analyze the volume and decay rate of search topics “mass shooting,” “gun control,” and “open carry,” following US mass shootings from 2004-2019. Shootings with more victims predict a higher volume of searches for “mass shooting,” and shorter search periods for “gun control” and “open carry.” Shootings with educational and religious targets had no significant effects on search patterns. Workplace shootings result in longer search periods for “mass shooting,” and shorter periods for “gun control.” Non-white shooters generate shorter search decay for “open carry.” The results support theories of media gatekeeping, suggesting events with more casualties generate more intense public attention. The consistent negative correlation between search volume and decay length suggests that sensational responses to shootings are not sustainable over long periods of time and prohibit pragmatically addressing mass shootings.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-12-28T16:32:44.845596,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-28T16:32:32.884815,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/citation/,dxkt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e038db70236b8000b7c54fa/,5e038db70236b8000b7c54fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dxkt6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dxkt6

Until now, polarization research has mainly focused on opinion extremeness, disregarding the correlation between different policy issues. We explain the emergence of hyperpolarization, i.e., the combination of extremeness and correlation between issues, by developing Weighted Balance Theory (WBT), a new theory of opinion formation. WBT extends Heider's cognitive balance theory to encompass multiple weighted attitudes. We validate WBT on empirical data from the 2016 National Election Survey. Furthermore, we develop an opinion dynamics model based on WBT, which, for the first time, is able to generate hyperpolarization and to explain the link between affective and opinion polarization. In addition, our theory encompasses other phenomena of opinion dynamics, including mono-polarization and backfire effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent-Based Modeling|Balance Theory|Opinion Dynamics|Polarization,2019-12-28T16:32:06.231120,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-28T16:31:50.417530,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/citation/,weg67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0339430236b8000978663a/,5e0339430236b8000978663a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/weg67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/weg67/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/weg67

Using Scopus to Map the Literature at the Intersection Between Artificial Intelligence and Research on Crime,"Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has spread over many scientific disciplines. Scientists have tested the power of intelligent algorithms developed to predict (or learn from) natural, physical and social phenomena. This also applies to crime-related research problems. Nonetheless, studies that map the current state of the art at the intersection between AI and crime are lacking. What are the current research trends in terms of topics in this area? What is the structure of scientific collaboration when considering works investigating criminal issues using machine learning, deep learning, and AI in general? What are the most active countries in this specific scientific sphere? Using data retrieved from the Scopus database, this work quantitatively analyzes 692 published works at the intersection between AI and crime employing network science to respond to these questions. Results show that researchers are mainly focusing on cyber-related criminal topics and that relevant themes such as algorithmic discrimination, fairness, and ethics are considerably overlooked. Furthermore, data highlight the extremely disconnected structure of co-authorship networks. Such disconnectedness may represent a substantial obstacle to a more solid community of scientists interested in these topics. Additionally, the graph of scientific collaboration indicates that countries that are more prone to engage in international partnerships are generally less central in the network. This means that scholars working in highly productive countries (e.g. the United States, China) tend to mostly collaborate domestically. Finally, current issues and future developments within this scientific area are also discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,Artificial Intelligence|Co-Authorship|Crime|Criminology|Deep Learning|Machine Learning|Science of Science|Social Network Analysis,2019-12-23T17:36:05.317793,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-23T17:35:35.401250,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/citation/,853fx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e00e926fad251000b72931d/,5e00e926fad251000b72931d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/853fx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/853fx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/853fx
