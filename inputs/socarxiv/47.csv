A flatter curve visually depicts when the illness is under control, while a higher peak curve emerges when the health case system becomes overwhelmed and instances of the virus are high. Together we work to “flatten the curve” by following the recommendations of our Chief Medical Officers of Health.

This is not the only visual metaphor used to refer to COVID-19, however; the “second wave” has also been used to describe the spread of COVID-19.

Under the terms of a government plan to tackle climate change, a driver for improved sustainability is the cut of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK to almost zero by 2050. With this type of change, new themes are continuously being developed which drive complex projects, such as the development of new power generation methods, which encompass challenging lead times and demanding requirements. Consideration of the implementation of strategies and key concepts, which may engender sustainability within complex projects therefore presents an opportunity for further critical debate, review, and application through a project management lens. Sustainability incorporation in project management has been documented in academic literature, with this emerging field providing new challenges. For example, project management education can provide a holistic base for the inculcation of sustainability factors to a range of industries, including complex projects. Likewise, practitioner interest and approaches to sustainability in project management are being driven by the recently Chartered Association for Project Management (APM). Whilst this body makes a significant contribution to the UK economy across many sectors, it also addresses ongoing sustainability challenges. Therefore, by drawing on research and practitioner developments, the authors argue that by connecting with the next generation through practice simulation approaches, and embedding sustainability issues within project management tools and methods, improved focus on sustainability in complex project management may be achieved.",TRUE,FALSE,APM|Association for Project Management|Climate Change|Complex Project Management|Pedagogy|Practice Simulation|Project Management|Sustainability|Sustainable Projects,2021-03-29T19:41:44.780082,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-29T19:41:26.816781,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/citation/,b4gya,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605f7c947ae196012cacf046/,605f7c947ae196012cacf046,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4gya/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b4gya/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b4gya,NA

Companies claim that surge pricing equilibrates supply and demand, but that is impossible, at least in the short run when demand unexpectedly outstrips supply. What surge pricing really does is to ration existing supplies based on ability to pay. That is both distributively unjust and potentially inefficient. It is also anticompetitive in the sense that it reduces the power of the competitive pricing that prevails before a surge in demand to carry over into the surge period. As such, surge pricing is similar in effect to price fixing, which also prevents competitive pricing from carrying over into periods during which firms have obtained power to raise prices. Courts should therefore rule surge pricing per se illegal under the antitrust laws, just as they do price fixing today.",TRUE,FALSE,ability to pay|algorithms|antitrust|consumer welfare|dynamic pricing|economic rent|monopolization|rationing|sherman act|surge pricing|technology,2021-03-29T19:55:42.552602,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-29T19:55:25.274337,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2b|Law|Antitrust and Trade Regulation,Ramsi A.

In an experiment, we find that participants deviate from optimal information acquisition in a systematic manner. They acquire too much information (when they should only collect little) or not enough (when they should collect a lot). We show that this pattern can be explained as naturally emerging from Fechner cognitive errors.

sions on the outcome of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) abatement. Through the diagnostic
social–ecological system (SES) framework, this review paper aimed to investigate what and how
the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affected the success level of seven selected
Asia-Pacific countries (namely, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and
New Zealand) in combatting COVID-19. Drawing on statistical data from the Our World In Data web-
site, we measured the COVID-19 severity or abatement success level of the countries on the basis of
cumulative positive cases, average daily cases, and mortality rates for the period of 1 February 2020
to 30 June 2020. A qualitative content analysis using three codes, i.e., present (P), partially present
(PP), and absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as score calculation and rank ordering for govern-
ment response effectiveness and the abatement success level across the countries, was undertaken.
Not only did the standard coding process ensure data comparability but the data were deemed
substantially reliable with Cohen’s kappa of 0.76. Among 13 attributes of the SES factors, high
facility adequacy, comprehensive COVID-19 testing policies, strict lockdown measures, imposition of
penalty, and the high trust level towards the government seemed to be significant in determining
the COVID-19 severity in a country. The results show that Vietnam (ranked first) and New Zealand
(ranked second), with a high presence of attributes/design principles contributing to high-level
government stringency and health and containment indices, successfully controlled the virus, while
Indonesia (ranked seventh) and Japan (ranked sixth), associated with the low presence of design
principles, were deemed least successful. Two lessons can be drawn: (i) having high number of P for
SES attributes does not always mean a panacea for the pandemic; however, it would be detrimental
to a country if it lacked them severely, and (ii) some attributes (mostly from the governance factor)
may carry higher weightage towards explaining the success level. This comparative study providing
an overview of critical SES attributes in relation to COVID-19 offers novel policy insights, thus
helping policymakers devise more strategic, coordinated measures, particularly for effective country
preparedness and response in addressing the current and the future health crisis.",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|Design principles|Institutional-social-ecological system|SES framework,2021-03-30T09:48:21.066817,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-30T09:47:59.096709,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/citation/,b9f2w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605eef4d229503010d6ef76a/,605eef4d229503010d6ef76a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b9f2w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b9f2w,NA
