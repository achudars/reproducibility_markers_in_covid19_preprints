Aiming to investigate the potential of reducing anxiety through ad libitum interaction with Artificial Intelligence chatbots, a controlled pilot study was conducted on East Asian staff of a large financial institution over a 4-week period, the sample of 40 divided between a test group using AI and the non-exposed subjects. Variety of measures were employed to gain as comprehensive an insight as warranted given the study limitations of a small sample, brief study period and relatively unsophisticated but freely available AI chatbot. The measures ranged from surveys of anxiety, attitudes toward daily chatbot usage, oral interviews and IELTS testing of English speaking ability. The results were cautiously encouraging: nearly universal endorsement of AI as a non-threatening interlocutor positively impacting subjects’ confidence and to the extent limited by time constraint, enhancing individual components of the IELTS paradigm. Moreover, significant linear relationship between individual anxiety survey items and overall IELTS scores at baseline was observed, lending a measure of validity to the construct developed for the occasion. In summary, it is felt that subject to further development and refinement, conversationally enhanced AI chatbots hold a significant promise toward reducing speech-related anxieties and learning inhibitions of English as a foreign language and thus merit further investigation toward this objective.",TRUE,FALSE,Adult Learning|Artificial Intelligence|Foreign Language Anxiety|IELTS|Non-Human Interlocutor,2019-08-04T20:59:02.019562,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:58:40.222365,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/citation/,js8qh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d472c8f90489f001b4c8370/,5d472c8f90489f001b4c8370,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/js8qh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/js8qh/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/js8qh

However, to best of my knowledge a little has been done in this regard to keep the students in line with the most recent advancements in this paradigm in Saudi Arabia. This paper evaluates the efficacy of CALL in improving students’ writing skills and provides innovative techniques and robust strategies for long-lasting learning. The research seeks to fill in the knowledge gap regarding prospects of using CALL in the Kingdom with these main research questions; 1) how is the technology presently used for teaching the writing skills?; 2) what is the true impact of using CALL on students’ writing skills?; 3) which area of the language (organization, structure, content, grammar) sees the most improvements by CALL to make them better writers? A quantitative research design was used for this study. The sample was sixty female students of a Saudi University divided equally into control and experimental groups. The elicited data analysis indicates that the performance scores of two groups differ significantly when taught through CALL. The research contends that using CALL can enhance students’ writing skills over a short period of time when compared to the traditional ways of improving the writing skills. The current study also recommends that language classrooms should be equipped with all the latest technological facilities to encourage the use of CALL.",TRUE,FALSE,Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL)|efficacy|EFL in Saudi Arabia|technology|writing skills,2019-08-04T20:59:22.414315,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:58:54.722476,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/citation/,ydv6m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d472bb290489f001a4a7edd/,5d472bb290489f001a4a7edd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydv6m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydv6m/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydv6m

It is challenging to apply collaborative learning methods because students tend to engage passively with traditional methods of lectures. Several studies have suggested that digital interactive technologies such as Zuvio Interactive Response System (IRS) have been applied to increase learning motivation. However, related studies on using IRS in English a foreign language (EFL) classrooms are limited in Taiwan, especially from learners' perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate an interactive response system into an English grammar course and to explore whether the assistance of this digital tool could promote students' learning motivation and whether it could facilitate a student learning environment. Based on the research background and rationale, the following research questions were investigated: (1) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward their learning attitudes? (2) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward learning contents? (3) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward classroom interaction? An experimental design was employed. This research was conducted in this one-semester project to uncover 49 EFL learners’ views of IRS in a grammar class. Zuvio IRS and the British Council Grammar Snacks videos were utilized in this experimental instruction. A questionnaire was administered and consisted of demographic information, Likert scale questions, and open-ended short-answer questions. The results showed positive attitudes for learning with Zuvio IRS and videos, and the interactions between students and the teacher that mediated by Zuvio IRS. Future studies might explore learning outcomes of students from different majors, implement results of IRS studies into curriculum and instruction, and create more appropriate questions into IRS.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL in Taiwanese context|grammar videos|interaction|interactive response system|motivation,2019-08-04T21:00:51.345377,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T21:00:13.612464,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/citation/,f6spw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d472aba3ce9350018f13206/,5d472aba3ce9350018f13206,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6spw/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6spw

* making a persuasive case for retaining traditional models of ‘school’ and ‘teacher’ in the face of compelling alternatives
* develop broader notions of ‘skills’, ‘competencies’ and ‘aptitudes’ that help students to flourish in an age of precarious employment, misinformation and an increasingly fragmented society
* engaging with digital technology in ways that strengthen the character and values of public education
* renegotiating relationships between educational institutions and the corporate actors that are shaping education agendas around the world
* engaging with public opinion, and fostering a genuine public understanding of (and support for) education
* re-imagining educational provision and practices that are appropriate for an age of climate change.

Each assumption is assessed through counterfactual reasoning using a combination of literature review and statistical analysis with a global perspective.

This paper is an attempt to recollect previous research and construct a parallel of psychoanalytic concepts and neuroscientific findings such as the correspondence between drive and libido and the dopaminergic seeking system. We are mind, body and language.
In our research we present the hypothesis that there are three existing paths of obtaining certain level of satisfaction – pleasure, jouissance and death drive, led by the pleasure principle of partial satisfaction and the Nirvana principle of (impossible) complete satisfaction.
In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud reviews his own drive theory incorporating a new term - death drive. Freud theorized about compulsion repetition, a cycle in which a behavior is carried out repeatedly and repressed material is lived instead of remembered, let alone elaborated. He observes that some are not guided by the principle of pleasure seeking, which reveals a complacency of the subject with the suffering of his symptoms, beyond their conscious yearning for healing. While the goal of the life drives is self-preservation, sexual satisfaction, creation and procreation, the final goal of the death drive appears to be to completely reduce tensions and return the living individual to the inorganic state of stillness and repose which is unachievable.
When Jacques Lacan introduces the concept of jouissance (enjoyment), he refers to this mythical state of complete satisfaction before the barrier of the castration as such.
The way to achieve this state of minimum tension, can as well be mediated by addiction and/or compulsive behavior as we have seen before, suppressing the internal tension of stimulus and surrendering to the principle of Nirvana and the death drives – complete reduction of any tension.
Now we know that the frontal cortex is responsible for regulating the instinctual reactions and puts them in social context. But when one appears to be struggling to achieve satisfaction by harmful or unpleasant actions this can be common consequence of the dopaminergic reward functions, resulting in a paradoxically dysfunctional behavior. Repetition is an important brain function. Repetition is involved in learning processes and improves performance.
