It complements the extensive research on the stratification of young adults' life chances in education and the labor market by considering changes over time in the stratification of contraceptive use at first intercourse by parental background. We seek to understand detraditionalization trends in young people’s sexually intimate behavior by investigating whether these trends were driven by particular social groups and how they were supported by policy initiatives. We study Italy from 1950-2006, which shows strong regional and socioeconomic disparities, and comparatively slow changes in religion and gender norms. Data from the “Survey on Italians’ Sexual Behavior” (2006) and macro indicators on family planning centers are used. The findings show a steep increase in contraceptive use at first sexual intercourse over time, stratified by parental background, but only for condom use.

A case study of problems in implementing evidence-based mental health policy.,"I examined the failure of the UK mental health framework policy NSF-9 to sustain the intended development in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in England from its inception in 2003. NSF-9 used Evidence-Based Policy/Practice (EBP) with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from both research and expert practitioner advice. Adequate funding was provided, the workforce was engaged from the outset, and the KPIs were supported by dedicated data collection and dissemination systems, so failure was unexpected. I reviewed theories from the social sciences of Public Administration and Policy Research (PAPR) from the perspective of three questions. 
1. Are there applicable Public Administration Theories (PATs) that can account for this unexpected outcome?
2. Did the metrics used, or their delivery, have administrative or policy characteristics which undermined their expected impact?
3. Are there organisational factors, separate from EBP commitment, which could have jeopardised the NSF model?
I undertook a qualitative synthesis of the findings of several qualitative and quantitative datasets, using constant comparison between the datasets’ results and candidate PATs. I concluded that the currently accepted explanation; NSF-9’s failure was caused by inadequacies in culture and values was incomplete, as they resulted from weaknesses in the EBP model itself. When I applied relevant PATs to the data, it was clear NSF-9 had many faults as a policy within the NHS bureaucracy, which were not compensated within its design, and drove its eventual failure. I concluded that policy success without including evidence from PAPR is extremely uncertain, and is a continuing structural risk, as there is currently a disjunction between PAPR and Health Services Research.

Evidence relating to the security hypothesis,"Residential burglary imposes significant financial and emotional costs upon victims and society overall. Yet residential burglary in the US has declined by over 80 percent across the last four decades,  representing a major social phenomenon that remains largely unexplained. International research  indicates a need for investigation of the security hypothesis. Here, 50 years of burglary studies are examined chronologically. A consistent narrative emerges which indicates that household security, largely absent in the 1970s, improved gradually over time. Improvement occurred via three  mechanisms: the increased prevalence, quality, and routine use of security fixtures and fittings. In addition, crime displacement declined as fewer household presented easy crime opportunities, and burglars’ average age increased ( juveniles finding burglary increasingly difficult). The likelihood that 50 years of diverse evidence points in the same direction by chance, and without significant contrary evidence, seems remote. Hence the conclusion is  that  gradual household security improvements played a central role in the decline in residential burglary over time.

In this study, we use the 2004 and 2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to examine whether the female-dominated industries of education and health care produce better job quality in terms of wages, benefits, hours, and job security for working-class men relative to other industries, with emphasis on differences by race-ethnicity. We find that although workers in the education and health care industries fared better during the Great Recession as compared to other industries, effects for wages, health insurance, hours, and layoff for working-class men of color were substantially lower as compared to white men. We find strong evidence of a racialized glass escalator, but also a racialized safety net in the care sector post-recession: the health care and education industries provide better job quality for white men than men of color, though they are less likely to be in these jobs, and these sectors were more protective of white men as compared to minorities during the recession.",TRUE,FALSE,labor market|low-wage work|race|recession|wage mobility,2020-01-19T22:48:21.862522,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-19T22:48:13.100431,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/citation/,2hzpv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2276fd675e0e00ce6b8dd2/,5e2276fd675e0e00ce6b8dd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hzpv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2hzpv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2hzpv,NA

ABMs are useful in that they offer scientists the opportunity to model processes, phenomena, and study systems that may not be otherwise reproducible or testable. Replication or re-implementation studies of ABMs are, however, infrequently undertaken, and there are few examples within archaeology or other social sciences. This paper documents the process of a successful ABM replication study, as well as two additional modifications to the original model. Results corroborate the findings of the original geoarchaeological model and indicate that episodic geomorphic events significantly affect archaeological deposit formation and the inferences drawn from associated radiocarbon records. One revision of the model further demonstrates that episodic fluvial events can create highly varied radiocarbon distributions. The second modification illustrates that excavation data helps to fill in hiatuses in radiocarbon chronologies on depositional landforms, although there is no effect across landscapes subject to erosion. This successful replication exercise also illustrates the value of open access data and analyses in reproducing, testing, and expanding upon archaeological research and theory building.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|geoarchaeology|radiocarbon dating|replication|simulation,2020-01-18T11:25:23.072989,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-18T11:25:01.065697,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/citation/,tckav,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2224f7edceab00c782f8fd/,5e2224f7edceab00c782f8fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tckav/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tckav,https://doi.org/10.5334/jcaa.52

Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer’s autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept the offer) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We causally estimate the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on transaction conversion by randomly exposing consumers to exogenously varied levels of chatbot anthropomorphism, operationalized by incorporating a random draw from a set of three anthropomorphic features: humor, communication delays and social presence. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in offer elasticity. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset. We also provide descriptive evidence suggesting that the benefits of anthropomorphism for transaction conversion may derive, at least in part, from consumers’ increased willingness to disclose personal information necessary to complete the transaction.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-18T11:21:23.791243,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-18T11:20:55.614452,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/citation/,xud6z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2215faedceab00cf82d57d/,5e2215faedceab00cf82d57d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xud6z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xud6z,NA

Key portions of sociological literatures on inequality and globalization, for instance, have focused on urban spaces as essential sites for the production and reproduction of social life, and urban sociology itself is one of the oldest fields in the discipline. For all of this prominence, however, locating the city itself in these literatures can be difficult. Much of our understanding of urban life and urban social problems is derived from a relatively small number of American cities. Moreover, cities are often relegated to a supporting role as a research site rather than an institution worthy of interrogation. This article reviews the path that has brought a specific set of cities to the fore of American sociological analyses. In response, broadening literatures to cities in the literal and figurative American South and producing deeper literatures of specific cities can give sociology the opportunity to produce more representative and contextually rich analyses of inequalities, urban social life, and urban form. The literature on St. Louis, Missouri, is presented as an example of what such a broader and deeper literature could encompass.",TRUE,FALSE,Chicago School|cities|inequality|St. Louis|urban sociology|W.E.B.

Statistical methods should belong to every multimodality researcher's toolset precisely because the phenomena under study are subtle and complex. Without applying basic statistical techniques, it is difficult to know whether one 'has' a result or not. Moreover, even if statistical tests are not undertaken, bearing in mind that they should – in principle – be possible at some stage of research adds clarity to methodology and design. Improving awareness of this issue is particularly important at this time because multimodality now faces the challenge of moving on from a period of broad theory construction to studies that build on those foundations. Reliably locating significant patterns in data is a crucial precondition for such work and statistical methods provide established and well-understood techniques for just this task. The primary intended audience of this article are researchers, and particularly junior researchers, who have not so far embraced such methods. We seek to show that the application of statistical methods is nowadays relatively straightforward and that adding these techniques is of considerable value both for conducting effective research and for convincing others of that effectiveness. Conversely, within many contemporary research contexts, not applying such methods is simply unnecessarily disempowering.",TRUE,FALSE,methodology|multimodality|R|statistics|visual analysis,2020-01-18T11:16:24.622476,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-18T11:16:05.556899,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/citation/,7j3np,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e21d73aedceab009a82fdbf/,5e21d73aedceab009a82fdbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j3np/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7j3np/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7j3np,NA

However, researchers and practitioners recognise that big data from mobile phones, social media, and on-board vehicle systems include biases in representation and accuracy, related to transportation safety statistics. This study examines both the sources of bias and approaches to mitigate them through a review of published studies and interviews with experts. Coding of qualitative data enabled topical comparisons and reliability metrics. Results identify four categories of bias and mitigation approaches that concern transportation researchers and practitioners: sampling, measurement, demographics, and aggregation. This structure for understanding and working with bias in big data supports research with practical approaches for rapidly evolving transportation data sources.",TRUE,FALSE,bias|big data|interview|safety|transportation,2020-01-18T09:09:42.166165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-18T09:09:23.896339,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/citation/,trbv9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e21d350675e0e008c6b5eb7/,5e21d350675e0e008c6b5eb7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbv9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/trbv9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/trbv9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42421-020-00013-0
