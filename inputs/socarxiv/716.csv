PCK and teaching competencies take shape within the initial preparation of ETEP in which student teachers spenda long time receiving knowledge and understanding the teaching context before they practically experience teaching at schools. During their BA study, students are required to study 49 courses which can be categorised into four main components: skills, linguistics, literature and professional. This study analyses the content of the curriculum courses so as tovisualise the way student teachers translate what they have learned into pedagogical practices during their teaching practices. In this study, the curriculum content of ETEP is qualitatively analysed using the inductive approach. Categories emerged from the analysis demonstrate various aspects of student teachers’ PCK. The analysis reveals that the pedagogical skills courses are not enough to enhance and strengthen the student teachers’ PCK needed to be reflected in their teaching practices. The findings show that the curriculum lacks courses necessary to provide student teachers with basic knowledge and pedagogical principles which are of vital significance to demonstrate their understanding before they are practically engaged in the teaching experience.",TRUE,FALSE,curriculum|EFL teacher education programme|pedagogical content knowledge|teaching practice|Yemen,2018-07-02T10:55:09.680694,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:59:26.771661,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/citation/,udfa6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/34ab7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/relationships/node/,34ab7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5d85b9ad5a100466bd5a8/,58e5d85b9ad5a100466bd5a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udfa6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udfa6/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udfa6

Instead of a single unitary system, the formal school system in Malaysia consists of national schools for all young Malaysians, national type schools (for Mandarin and Tamil speaking students) and also national religious schools (or sekolah kebangsaan agama) that focus on Islamic education for the Muslim majority group. From informal Islamic schools (or sekolah pondok) of the past, today’s national religious schools continue to play a critical role in educating young Malaysians. Nevertheless, these schools are facing difficult challenges to remain relevant in a rapidly developing society. One of these difficulties relates to English language teaching. In national religious schools where Islamic education and Arabic language are given priority, teaching English as a core subject becomes a real challenge; some students deliberately resist learning English as it is a ‘Western’ language and some teachers view English teachers as the ‘Other’ within these schools. This research article is based on a longitudinal effort to study these difficult challenges and to shed light on the lived experiences of English teachers in Malaysia’s national Islamic schools. Drawing on ‘thick’ narrative data from face-to-face interviews, written narrative accounts, and informal online and mobile exchanges, this article deals with the ‘stories’ of becoming and being an English teacher within Malaysian Islamic schools.

It will discover the importance given to correct pronunciation, as well as gauging learners’ attitudes towards the possibility of introducing podcasts as a new language input tool for facilitating improvements in pronunciation. To achieve this, the previous literature in this area is reviewed, followed by presenting the results and analysing the data from an attitudinal questionnaire distributed amongst 23 Level 3 Saudi EFL learners from the department of English at Imam University.   The questionnaire is divided into two parts- one concerning proper pronunciation, and the other podcasts. The data analysis shows that the participants, in spite of the low rate of improvement in their pronunciation, have positive attitudes towards the proper pronunciation of English. This outcome is compatible with previous studies` results, which assert that having a positive attitude towards a particular language and its speakers can improve pronunciation. The students were presented with a total of five podcasts related to their speaking and listening textbook for use over an eight week period, and at the end of this time they were requested to complete the questionnaire.

However, there are controversies over the most effective instructional methods. Therefore, following a comparison group design, the present study aims to investigate the relative efficacy of two conditions of output-production task repetition on high- and low-level English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ production of speech acts. The main effects of the instructional conditions, EFL proficiency level, and the potential interaction between them are examined. Two classes of English-major students take speech act lessons involving output-generation task repetition as follows:  (1) the implicit task-repetition (ITR) group is provided with visually enhanced input plus a consciousness raising task before repeating the output-generation tasks, and (2) the explicit task-repetition (ETR) group is provided with input plus metapragmatic information before repeating the output-generation tasks. The learners’ speech act production is assessed through a written discourse completion test (WDCT) across a pretest and a posttest. The results demonstrate significant gains for both groups from the pretest to the posttest. Moreover, the ETR group significantly outperforms the ITR group in the posttest. Furthermore, EFL proficiency level is found to have a significant effect on learners’ speech act production, with high-level learners outperforming low-level learners. The results reveal no significant interaction between the effects of instructional condition and EFL proficiency level.

Based on multiple data sources (i.e. interviews, observation, questionnaires and document analysis), the study aims to highlight how Raya's multiple identities as a language learner, avid film watcher, YouTube user and online gamer, and a (non) member of a target language community have contributed to her oral proficiency in English. The study also aims to emphasize some personal attributes that Raya has as a language learner in order to uncover the factors which have assisted or hampered her acquisition of English. The main finding of the case study is that Raya's English language proficiency has been enriched because of two overriding factors: firstly, integrative motivation (i.e. her love of English) highlighted through her immersion in the target language by her online identity, films and social interaction; and, secondly, instrumental motivation (i.e. using the language as a means to academic and professional advancement) in the sense she realized English was a way of helping her to achieve her goal of leaving her hometown and studying abroad. It is hoped that this study will inspire and inform both language learners and educators alike, as to some of the steps to success in acquiring proficiency in English or any other language.",TRUE,FALSE,advanced speaker|instrumental motivation|integrative motivation|learning styles|second language acquisition,2018-07-02T10:55:09.426327,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:28:28.006021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/citation/,32zbj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bknr8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/relationships/node/,bknr8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5d1489ad5a100456bd44b/,58e5d1489ad5a100456bd44b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32zbj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/32zbj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.12,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/32zbj

The present study aims to delineate the efficacy of ESP vis-à-vis the PYP with special reference to Najran University. It intends to investigate whether PYP students’ English proficiency conforms to ESP standards by analysing teachers’ feedback and expert opinions. The research design makes methodological triangulation using both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaire) methods. Forty teachers of PYP, teaching various courses of English, Najran University were randomly selected to elicit their feedback and opinion on various aspects of students’ linguistic proficiency vis-à-vis ESP standards. The questionnaire consisted of eleven questions using Likert’s 5 scales (Strongly Agree, Agree, Can’t Say, Disagree, Strongly Disagree). Semi-structured interviews were also used to acquire detailed perceptions of the teachers. Ten teachers were interviewed with four questions pertaining to the relevant research area. Based on the data analysis, it is observed that most of the students at PYP have language proficiency to learn ESP, but not up to the desired level. There is a need to enhance learners’ proficiency level required for various professional disciplines. In the end, this study offers some remedial measures and suggestions aiming not only to raise the compatibility of ESP in the context of PYP in Saudi Arabia, but also to inject more ESP-oriented materials in the curriculum.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL|ESP|ESP materials|professional disciplines|PYP,2018-07-02T10:55:09.388376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:24:26.666472,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/citation/,mq57n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kszv3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/relationships/node/,kszv3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5d0196c613b0252fe9f3c/,58e5d0196c613b0252fe9f3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mq57n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mq57n/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mq57n

The main question is to identify how Arabic language influences the acquisition of do-support. The influence of L2 proficiency level in the acquisition of do-support is also addressed. The study is conducted within the perspective of Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis and Differential Markedness Hypothesis. Do-support as a marked feature of English has received little or no attention in previous work on the acquisition of English as a second language by adult Arab learners.  This study seeks to fill that gap by documenting the acquisition of do-support in negation and interrogatives. To address these aims, a written production task, a multiple-choice task and a semi-structured interview were administered to 10 adult Arab learners of low and advanced English proficiency levels. The findings indicate that the role of Arabic is noted. While not the source of errors, it acts as a strategy that adult Arab learners use to dealing with limited L2 knowledge and the markedness of do-support, which is the main source of difficulty shown by adult Arab learners. The role of learners’ L1 is selective according to the learners’ perception of what is difficult or not.  Moreover, a significant relationship was found between L2 proficiency level and the mastery of do-support in that high- proficiency learners outperform low-proficiency learners. It is recommended that future research examine the acquisition and markedness of do-support in the interlanguage of Arabic-speaking children.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic influence|do-support|L2 proficiency level|markedness,2018-07-02T10:55:09.356099,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-06T05:19:12.922563,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/citation/,d62u5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/za3fj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/relationships/node/,za3fj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e5cf0ab83f6902524f9509/,58e5cf0ab83f6902524f9509,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d62u5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d62u5/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d62u5
