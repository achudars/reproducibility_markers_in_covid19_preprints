The filter theory of education (Arrow 1973), the theory of education as a “signal” (Spence 1973) and the theory of “screening” (Stiglitz 1975), for instance, have seriously challenged it from within mainstream economics, and heavy criticism has also come from other paradigms, with Bailly (2016) recently documenting the critique from the radical school. Within this set of ideas that flourished in the post-WWII period and challenged human capital theory, John Kenneth Galbraith’s analysis of the dynamics of the education process is often neglected. In his original institutionalist and firm-based approach to the evolution of education, Galbraith placed great emphasis on the issue of the requirements of the planning system when he tackled the issue of human capital investment. More surprisingly – since he is unanimously recognized as the “founding father” of the “human capital revolution” – Theodore Schultz himself developed a substantial critique of human capital theory that shares some ground with Galbraith’s. The aim of this contribution is to provide new insights into the history of post-WWII ideas in the field of economics of education by reviewing Schultz’s and Galbraith’s respective analyses of education and highlighting their proximities. Both authors raise doubts regarding the idea that the aggregation of individual choices must be regarded as the relevant generative mechanism of the dynamic of education and the basis of the allocation of education resources.

However, many low-income households are disadvantaged because existing public transit service does not provide them with sufficient access to destinations. Limited transit options, compounded with socioeconomic disadvantage, can result in transport poverty, preventing travel to important destinations, like employment opportunities. Given the growing gentrification of Canadian downtowns and the dispersion of poverty into Canadian suburbs, the time is right for a national accounting of those living in transport poverty, and the development of a national transport and land use strategy for alleviating the risks of accessibility deprivation. Accordingly, in this paper we measure and analyze vertical inequalities in access to employment in Canadian cities in order to estimate how many, where, and to what extent, Canadians are at risk of transport poverty. We make use of open transit network data and cutting edge accessibility measurement methods to generate comparative scores suitable for a national-scale analysis. We find that in aggregate, lower income neighbourhoods tend to have better levels of transit accessibility. But despite this overall positive outlook, there are still nearly one million low-income individuals living in urban areas with low transit accessibility. We summarize our findings by generating descriptive typologies for areas vulnerable to transport poverty which are then used to develop and recommend planning strategies to reduce inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|canada|geography|inequalities|policy|poverty|public transit|transit|transport|transportation|urban,2019-01-18T20:52:09.642085,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-18T20:51:48.661126,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/citation/,ua2gj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c423920154ce50018dd1423/,5c423920154ce50018dd1423,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ua2gj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ua2gj,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2018.11.018

Despite its widespread use, few measurement options allow for the comparison of accessibility across multiple urban systems, and most do not adequately control for market competition between demand‐side actors and supply‐side facilities in localized markets. In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities.

First, they occurred between two democratic NATO allies, members of a Western security community. Second, Iceland came close to withdrawing its NATO membership and closing the US base on Icelandic soil, which would have adversely affected the balance of power in the North Atlantic and jeopardized Iceland’s core security interests. Third, Iceland, a microstate, won each of these disputes. Historians and political scientists have consequently found it problematic to account for these puzzling disputes. This study proposes a Neoclassical Realist account for the occurrence and outcomes of the Cod Wars. I argue that the disputes occurred due to (i) powerful domestic pressures on statesmen to escalate and (ii) elite miscalculation. As the disputes escalated and Iceland’s Western alignment was put at greater risk, statesmen in both countries, mindful of the dangers of re-alignment, were able to resolve the conflicts in the end. The outcomes of the disputes reflect how British statesmen were able to make greater concessions due to weaker domestic constraints than those faced by Icelandic leaders. Iceland therefore reached a highly favorable agreement in all Cod Wars.",TRUE,FALSE,cod wars|foreign policy|iceland|international relations|militarized interstate dispute|neoclassical realism|small states|uk|united kingdom|war,2019-01-18T19:04:01.116301,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-18T19:03:50.150087,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/citation/,26ubp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4206d837763200192a0ca4/,5c4206d837763200192a0ca4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26ubp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26ubp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26ubp,https://doi.org/10.1093/fpa/orw062

Just as biologists seek to explain population-level trends in genetic evolution in terms of micro-evolutionary processes such as selection, drift and migration, cultural evolutionists have sought to explain population-level cultural phenomena in terms of underlying social, psychological and demographic factors. Primary amongst these factors are learning biases, describing how cultural items are socially transmitted from person to person. As big datasets become more openly available and workable, and statistical modelling techniques become more powerful, efficient and user-friendly, describing population-level dynamics in terms of simple, individual-level learning biases is becoming more feasible. Here we test for the presence of learning biases in two large datasets of popular song lyrics dating from 1965-2015. We find some evidence of content bias, prestige bias and success bias in the proliferation of negative lyrics, and suggest that negative expression of emotions in music, and perhaps art generally, provides an avenue for people to not only process and express their own negative emotions, but also benefit from the knowledge that prestigious others experience similarly negative emotions as they do.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|content bias|cultural evolution|emotions|prestige bias|song lyrics|success bias,2019-01-17T21:53:21.583548,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-17T21:53:02.066123,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/citation/,3j6wx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c40b3687cf3f5001bb8d78c/,5c40b3687cf3f5001bb8d78c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3j6wx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3j6wx,NA

Despite what scholars and journalists consider a worrying trend, there is no evidence of growing popular concern about inequality. In fact, research suggests that citizens in unequal societies are less concerned than those in more egalitarian societies. How to make sense of this paradox? I argue that citizens’ consent to inequality is explained by their growing conviction that societal success is reflective of a meritocratic process. Drawing on 25-years of International Social Survey Programme data, I show that rising inequality is legitimated by the popular belief that the income gap is meritocratically deserved: the more unequal a society, the more likely its citizens are to explain success in meritocratic terms, and the less important they deem non-meritocratic factors such as a person’s family wealth and connections.",TRUE,FALSE,beliefs|income|inequality|ISSP|longitudinal|meritocracy|political attitudes|theory|trend,2019-01-17T14:32:21.635756,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-17T14:31:56.404756,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Theory and Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/citation/,dcr9b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n6p3w/,n6p3w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c405f3fe8da0e0019599fc8/,5c405f3fe8da0e0019599fc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dcr9b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dcr9b,https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwy051

To achieve this ultimate aim in teacher education, as argued by moral philosophers, psychologists, and educators, teachers should be able to well understand the mechanisms of moral functioning and how to effectively promote moral development based on evidence. Recent findings in the fields of social sciences that have examined how morality is functioning among human beings, moral psychology in particular, provide us with the evidence through experiments and observations. Furthermore, thanks to the development of scientific research methods that enable researchers to investigate the neural-level nature of human behavior, the researchers now can examine neural correlates of moral functioning that constitutes the basis of moral behavior and development. To facilitate the understanding of the field of neuroscience of morality and its educational implications within the context of teacher education, first, the recent trend in the field will be reviewed, and second, how it can provide useful insights to teachers and teacher educations will be discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,education|moral development|morality|moral psychology|neuroscience|teacher education,2019-01-17T14:48:28.455988,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-17T14:47:40.518174,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/citation/,97g3e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3fb9f3e8da0e001858d86f/,5c3fb9f3e8da0e001858d86f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/97g3e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/97g3e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/97g3e,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1179-6_190-1

Social inequities experienced by women and girls, compounded by norms characterized by male dominance increase risk of IPV. To address this problem, the Change Starts at Home Project employs a social behavior change communication strategy (SBCC) to shift behavior and norms related to IPV in 36 Village Development Committees in three districts (Chitwan, Kapilvastu, Nawalparasi) in Nepal. The project is being evaluated with a cluster randomized trial (NCT02942433). Data for the manuscript come from baseline surveys of reproductive-aged women randomly selected from the intervention and control communities (N=1440) and female intervention enrollees (N=360). Descriptive statistics were used to identify differences across and within intervention arms and among intervention enrollees and randomly selected participants from the same communities. A total of 1982 individuals were assessed for eligibility resulting in a response rate of 72.65%. The cooperation rate was 84.16%. Results indicate broad sociodemographic similarities on most variables, although a higher percentage of intervention participants were unemployed and a lower percentage had love marriages compared to both study conditions.  A smaller percentage of women in the intervention communities reported physical and / or sexual IPV in the prior 12 months (23.89%) than control communities (31.81%) or intervention participants (15.00%). Participants reported favorably to questions inquiring about whether their rights as participants were upheld, however, a minority felt they could discontinue at any time suggesting the need for greater consideration of this aspect of participation in subsequent data collection.",TRUE,FALSE,Couples|Intimate Partner Violence|Nepal|Participant Reaction|Prevention|Social and Behavior Change Communication,2019-01-15T20:23:01.193660,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-15T20:22:44.709698,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/citation/,7kzec,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3d4a3a8047080018005a3c/,5c3d4a3a8047080018005a3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7kzec/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7kzec/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7kzec,NA
