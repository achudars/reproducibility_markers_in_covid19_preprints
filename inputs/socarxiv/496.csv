Ania Loomba has suggested that ""more than any other play of the time, Othello allows us to see that skin colour, religion, and location were often contradictorily yoked together within ideologies of 'race,' and that all these attributes were animated by notions of sexual and gender difference."" While some critics would moderate that view—pointing more or less toward religion, or gender, or geography—few would disagree about the basic ideology of race that Loomba identifies in the play and the early modern period. Daniel J. Vitkus, for example, focuses more on religious conversion than race, but still argues that ""cultural anxieties about 'turning Turk'"" were part of ""the fear of a black planet that gripped Europeans in the early modern era as they faced the expansion of Ottoman power."" Many others have agreed that the play ""repeats and reinforces the already established perception of Turks as the 'religious threat' and racial 'other.'"" A few, like Eric Griffin, have brought the focus on religion closer to home, reading the play as an expression of English nationalism during a time of tension with Catholic Spain, when anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish expression was its own form of othering ""ethnocentric discourse."" But even this broadened critical discussion is based on examination of a limited number of the texts published in early modern England, and it tells only a small part of the story of race in Othello. Digital approaches, however, open up a vast new body of texts for analysis, shifting the ground on which such criticism can take place.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T13:57:45.400291,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T13:57:21.393930,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/citation/,tg23u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/we5uh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/relationships/node/,we5uh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e6f426d4eb300126e5aa5/,5b4e6f426d4eb300126e5aa5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tg23u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tg23u/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.018,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tg23u

We have reached two conclusions, which may seem in tension with each other. The first is that gender divisions between characters have become less sharply marked over the last 170 years. In the middle of the nineteenth century, very different language is used to describe fictional men and women. But that difference weakens steadily as we move forward to the present; the actions and attributes of characters are less clearly sorted into gender categories. On the other hand, we haven't found the same progressive story in the history of authorship. In fact, there is an eye-opening, under-discussed decline in the proportion of fiction actually written by women, which drops by half (from roughly 50% of titles to roughly 25%) as we move from 1850 to 1950. The number of characters who are women or girls also drops. We are confronted with a paradoxical pattern. While gender roles were becoming more flexible, the space actually allotted to (real, and fictional) women on the shelves of libraries was contracting sharply. We explore the evidence for this paradox and suggest a few explanations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:04:25.346365,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:03:57.466420,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/citation/,fr9bk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w5vtp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/relationships/node/,w5vtp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e6cce6d4eb300126e590b/,5b4e6cce6d4eb300126e590b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fr9bk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fr9bk/,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.019,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fr9bk

This issue is thus situated at the intersection of literary studies and sociology, looking outward toward the novel's construction of ethnicities, genders, class categories, and racial terminology. It is also situated in an emerging scholarly publishing ecology that allows the journal to release articles progressively, as they pass through the peer review process and reach completion, rather than waiting for an entire set to be complete.

One of the most powerful insights of reader-response theory in the 1970s and 1980s is that the meaning of a text never resides entirely within the artifact itself. Commentators from Carlo Ginzberg (""aggressive originality""), to Jauss (""horizon of expectations""), to Fish (""interpretive communities""), and Radway (""Reading is not Eating"") have long-since established that readers are creators of meaning. To quote Tony Bennett, meaning ""is not a thing that texts can have, but is something that can only be produced, and always differently, within the reading formations that regulate the encounters between texts and readers."" Yet even as it challenges the very idea that texts exist independently of readers and their institutional and social contexts, Bennett's concept of a ""reading formation"" also reminds us that there are socio-historically determined limits to creative appropriation. For Bennett, text, context, and reader constitute an inseparable unity; every reading situation is shaped by ""discursive and intertextual determinations that organize and animate the practice of reading. . . .""

While social and institutional fields impose meaning structures, they are put to practice (emerge) in the context of specific activities that take place within a field. Collaborating in small groups, field participants form such practical contexts. It enables playing on gaps and overlaps among imposed meaning structures and joint creation of emergent meaning structures that define them as a social group. Difficult to capture, emergent meaning structures are largely disregarded by institutional and field perspectives on meaning structures. As a consequence, the importance of collective practice to meaning structures is underrated.
We investigate imposed and emergent meaning structures in artistic collectives. The field of contemporary art does not impose its meaning structure explicitly, so meaning structures that emerge in artistic practice are relatively free to vary across social groups. In particular, we study two St. Petersburg collectives of artists, who intensely interact with each other and engage in joint creative work and exhibitions. We show that these collectives elaborate their own meaning structures within the framework of field-specific meaning structures, blending meanings corresponding to the different fields and field positions occupied by members of the collective.
The duality of semantic and social structure is central to the notion of meaning structures. We use word collocations in natural language as semantic structure and interaction ties as social structure in a mixed methods socio-semantic network analysis.

In both cases, the literary-geographic imagination—or unconscious—of the period between 1880 and 1940 can help to shed light on how texts by British and British-aligned writers of the era understood these issues and how they evolved over time. At the highest level, how can we characterize the international and domestic geographies of British writing? What roles, if any, did cultural identity play in contemporary writers' spatial imagination? What locations were over- or under-represented in their work and how, if at all, does the answer change when we group writers by national origin or by perceived ethnicity? What shifts in geographic attention marked the transition from the late Victorian period to the interwar era of high modernism?

As part of a larger ethnographic project, I draw upon over ten years worth of diversity discourse at DU to illuminate diversity’s economization: the process whereby specific formations of economic values, practices, and metrics are extended toward diversity as justification for DU’s efforts. My analysis responds to three questions: (1) how is diversity economized by the organization; (2) how is this economization articulated through organizational discourse on diversity; and (3) how does the economization of diversity potentially reconfigure race and racial subjectivities? My findings reveal three interrelated processes that facilitate diversity’s: diversity-as-investment, diversity metrics, and diversity-as-affective labor. Together these processes congeal and convert multicultural principles and practices into economic ones.

It examines general trends in the number of speeches mentioning disability, including the parties and MPs most likely to mention disability issues, and examines how disability is used in conjunction with two keywords: ‘rights’ and ‘vulnerable’. It uses these keywords to explore two conceptions of how the state should engage with disability and disabled people: a paternalistic conception (which post-2010 has become more common) and a rights-based conception (which has been in decline since the 1990s). I conclude with a discussion about how this reﬂects the disability movement in the UK, and what it means for the future of disability politics, the welfare state and how disabled people themselves might view paternalistic government policies.",TRUE,FALSE,disability|disability rights|Hansard|political discourse|vulnerability,2018-07-18T13:43:05.557865,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-17T20:18:36.080796,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Discourse and Text Linguistics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/citation/,tqf5j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zga8w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/relationships/node/,zga8w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4dec19778458000e06c9dd/,5b4dec19778458000e06c9dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqf5j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqf5j/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqf5j

Open data standards ensure interoperability, establish benchmarks in assessing whether governments achieve their goals in publishing open data, can better ensure accuracy of the data. Interoperability enables the use of off-the shelf software and can ease third party development of products that serves multiple locales. Our project aims to determine which standards for civic data are “best” to open up government data. We began by disambiguating the multiple meanings of what constitutes a data standard by creating a standards stack. The empirical research started by identifying twelve “high value” open datasets for which we found 22 data standards. A qualitative systematic review of the gray literature and standards documentation generated 18 evaluation metrics, which we grouped into four categories. We evaluated the metrics with civic data standards. Our goal is to identify and characterize types of standards and provide a systematic way to assess their quality.",TRUE,FALSE,government|open data|standards,2018-07-17T10:40:44.282671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-17T10:40:15.806536,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/citation/,gns9a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3cszf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/relationships/node/,3cszf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4d222b1e450900114c2302/,5b4d222b1e450900114c2302,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gns9a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gns9a/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gns9a

This paper is a case study on this superhero anime in order to demonstrate that the convergence in media is a process both top-down corporate-driven and bottom-up consumer-driven. The unique feature of this anime is the integration of product placement with the story itself. The sponsors in real life place their product logos onto the hero suits of the superheroes in the anime, whom are celebrity superheroes of a reality TV show in the story universe. Therefore, in the story world of this anime, characters are dealing with a highly commercialized media convergence themselves.
This research illustrates the change in audience attitude and their reflections on such commercialization within and outside of the story world. The data unfolds the changing relationship between audience and producers and the influence of participatory culture on the media production, especially in the realm of audience's sense making towards the product placement within the show.",TRUE,FALSE,anime fandom|convergence culture|feedback analysis|participatory culture|product placement,2018-07-17T10:40:07.542049,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-17T10:39:44.031699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/citation/,knsug,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w3p6s/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/relationships/node/,w3p6s,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4cef61e1946f0011db7667/,5b4cef61e1946f0011db7667,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knsug/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/knsug/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/knsug
