In so doing, we contextualize the analysis of university rankings within a broader sociology of rankings. We identify two dimensions along which such contextualization could be done: (a) systematic, referring to the comparison of university rankings with rankings in other fields and focusing on how university rankings can be informed by insights from other empirical settings; and (b) historical, which concerns long-term trajectories, rather than just the past few years. We argue that analogical theorizing is one promising strategy for doing this, and to illustrate its potential, we bring insights from the arts and sports fields into the study of university rankings.

The uptake of electric vehicles on a mass scale requires the simultaneous adoption of such vehicles for private and commercial purposes. Although literature regarding the private sphere is consistent, there is comparatively less empirical research seeking to explain the factors that enable and hinder the uptake of electric vehicles at a commercial level at which fleet managers have a prominent role. Based on an empirical survey conducted in Italy, this paper investigates the role of technical and financial information in fleet managers’ procurement decision-making. Results suggest a lack of awareness regarding technical characteristics of vehicles, given that 59% of the fleet managers surveyed scored low to medium. Furthermore, a misalignment related to the expected investment payback period was observed, considering that 49% declared that they expect a payback period within three years. Given that exposure to electric vehicles within fleets constitutes an incentive for private purchase, well-designed policies for corporate fleets’ electrification would lead to remarkable growth of the electric vehicles  market.",TRUE,FALSE,corporate fleet|decarbonization|electric cars|electric vehicles|fleet management|green economy|survey,2021-02-14T00:39:02.851425,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-14T00:38:42.015784,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/citation/,b3e56,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6027b67873c9fe026c0766eb/,6027b67873c9fe026c0766eb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b3e56/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b3e56/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b3e56,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rtbm.2021.100627

To hedge against this risk of biased omissions, one would need an exhaustive list of major scientific presses and their journals. Such an inclusive catalogue, however, does not exist yet. This paper explores whether webscraping multiple heterogeneous research-related platforms could fill this gap. In a first step, the project draws from the content coverages of Scopus, Publons, DOAJ and SherpaRomeo to extract a preliminary list of publishers that supposedly possess at least 30 journals. In a second step, the project scrapes each of the publisher’s website to fetch their respective journal portfolios. The outcome is a list of 137 publishers comprising 25.816 journals. Many of the publishers, especially those that operate outside the U.S. and Western Europe, would have been overlooked if one had drawn from merely one or two sources. The catalogue can thus be deemed comprehensive, inclusive and diverse.

The onset of parenthood is likely to be a key event that affects expectations. This paper explores whether the expectations of women who have only one child (one child women) change in the five years before and after first birth, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (USA) and Understanding Society (UK). We aim to determine whether one child women are distinct in their expectations from women who go on to higher parities even before first birth, and whether the event of first birth is a catalyst for changing expectations. 
Our results show that, in both contexts, one child women expect closer to two children prior to, compared to after, first birth, when the trajectory declines more steeply towards one.

The current study aimed to identify social ecological factors related to loneliness and examine the extent to which geographic region accounts for differences in loneliness.

Methods: The data come from a cross-sectional sample of 6503 young people living in the United Kingdom. Loneliness was measured using the UCLA 3-item scale. Bivariate analyses were used to test associations between each predictor and loneliness. Multilevel models were used to identify key social ecological factors related to loneliness, and the extent to which loneliness varied across geographic regions. 

Results: Socio-demographic, social, health and wellbeing, and community factors were found to be associated with loneliness. Geographic region accounted for 5-8% of the variation in loneliness. The effect of gender, sexual orientation, and minority ethnic background on loneliness differed across geographic regions. 

Conclusions: This is the first study to highlight modifiable social and community factors related to youth loneliness, and individual vulnerabilities, such as poor mental wellbeing.

We highlight the excitement that her hiring at the University of Montreal created, and the paper concludes with a summary of her scientific activities in the USA and Australia after 1959.",TRUE,FALSE,histoire de l'archéologie|history of archaeology|Québec|Thérèse Belleau,2021-02-16T06:04:00.809282,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-16T06:03:37.066104,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,Julien Riel-Salvatore,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/citation/,eckhu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6025928873c9fe01a807687d/,6025928873c9fe01a807687d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eckhu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eckhu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eckhu,NA

Of particular interest is gentrification, which has been measured and mapped in fairly standard ways – even as its place in the broader public consciousness has grown rapidly. We argue that big data offers a new approach to the persistent problem of defining and measuring gentrification. Moreover, using big data also allows us to rethink broader questions about theory and methodological approaches in urban geography and GIScience. Using geotagged Twitter data as an indicator of social activity and connections, we demonstrate how the changing geographies of users’ tweets are proxies for the evolving social and spatial contours of urban neighborhoods. We use the case of Lexington, Kentucky and its gentrifying Northside to analyze the evolving mobilities and relational connections of neighborhood residents and visitors as gentrification intensified over time. We argue that these kinds of big data allow for an analytical approach that focuses on the dynamic, relational connections between people and places, and provides a useful, additional avenue in understanding a process as complex and multifaceted as gentrification.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|gentrification|Lexington|relational geography|social media|Twitter,2021-02-12T06:36:42.346857,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-12T06:36:04.177080,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/atepoorthuis/relationalgeographiesofgentrification,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/citation/,eq6vm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602575fd23238301919d95f1/,602575fd23238301919d95f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eq6vm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eq6vm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eq6vm,https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2021.1888016

Specifically, high technology and equity-funded startups are heralded for their innovative products and services that are believed to alter the economic, social, and even political fabric of life in advantageous ways. This chapter draws on established theory on the causes of misconduct in and by organizations to elaborate the factors that can give rise to misconduct in entrepreneurial ventures, illustrating our arguments with case material on both widely known and less well-known instances of entrepreneurial misconduct. In venturing into the dark side of entrepreneurship, we hope to contribute to theory on entrepreneurship and organizational misconduct, augment entrepreneurship pedagogy, and offer ideas and examples that can enhance entrepreneurs’ awareness of their susceptibility to wrongdoing.",TRUE,FALSE,entrepreneurship|misconduct|Nikola|platform organizations|startup|Theranos|WeWork|wrongdoing,2021-02-12T06:36:02.377825,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-12T06:35:22.811186,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/citation/,hecv9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6024fe3d23238301659d6d4b/,6024fe3d23238301659d6d4b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hecv9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hecv9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hecv9,NA
