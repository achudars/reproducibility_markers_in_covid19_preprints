When researchers publish their results, journals and granting agencies increasingly want datasets opened alongside. These datasets may vary in quality, reusability, and comprehensiveness. Yet, without a clear knowledge of how the research methodology and analysis affects the production of the raw data, any future attempts to reproduce analysis will produce the same magical results only by following the same steps. While the requirement for Open Data in government funded research can provide an excellent basis for future research, not all Open Data is created equal. Releasing the methods of analysis alongside a dataset of high quality will also allow for lower technical difficulties when reusing or remixing the data.

Circuity results from a circulation network’s configuration, planning, and underlying terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use urban space for settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall street network circuity, researchers have not studied the relative circuity of walkable versus drivable circulation networks. To address this gap, this study uses OpenStreetMap data to explore relative network circuity. We download walkable and drivable networks for 40 US cities using the OSMnx software, which we then use to simulate two million routes and analyze circuity to characterize network structure. We find that walking networks tend to allow for more direct trips than driving networks do in most cities: average driving circuity exceeds average walking circuity in all but four of the cities that exhibit statistically significant differences between network types. We discuss various reasons for this phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network circuity also varies substantially between different types of places. These findings underscore the value of using network-based distances rather than straight-line distances when studying urban travel and access. They also suggest the importance of differentiating between walkable and drivable circulation networks when modeling and characterizing urban street networks: although different modes’ networks overlap in any given city, their relative structure and performance vary in most cities.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|big data|circuity|cities|civil engineering|driving|geospatial|GIS|land use|modeling|network analysis|networks|open data|OpenStreetMap|pedestrian|public data|python|simulation|spatial analysis|street network|transportation|urban design|urban form|urban morphology|urban planning|urban studies|walkability,2018-07-02T11:05:25.355213,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-02T17:10:54.420796,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/citation/,4rzqa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7fr5m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/relationships/node/,7fr5m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598206fc6c613b022b7e2ce0/,598206fc6c613b022b7e2ce0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4rzqa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4rzqa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4rzqa,NA

This dissertation unpacks theories of nonlinearity and complex systems, then develops a framework for assessing the complexity of urban form and street networks. It introduces a new tool, OSMnx, to collect street network and other urban form data for anywhere in the world, then analyze and visualize them.

Exploring the Role of Intrauterine Environment in Moderating Genetic Influences on Body Weight,"By incorporating molecular genetic variants and the fetal origins of obesity hypothesis into a gene-environment interaction framework, this study investigates the potential interactive effects of variation in the obesity-associated gene (FTO) and intrauterine environment on body mass index (BMI) in adulthood. This study draws on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, and uses sibling comparisons that allow for quasi-experimental variations in both genetic and environmental factors. Findings demonstrated that even after controlling for unobserved family background, the FTO variants and birth weight are generally associated with adult BMI. Moreover, this study found that the effects of having a risk allele of the FTO gene are largely concentrated on those who were heavier at birth, providing evidence for a gene-environment interaction on BMI and the development of obesity. Results of this study suggest that genes are not destiny and environmental factors may offset the effects of obesity-promoting genes. In particular, efforts to counteract genetic effects on obesity may begin as early as in utero. Interventions to prevent higher birth weight may help reduce the risk of obesity later in life, by directly addressing the programming effects of the in utero environment and also indirectly moderating the obesity-promoting genetic effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Birth Weight|BMI|FTO|Gene-Environment Interaction|Obesity|WLS,2018-07-02T11:05:24.598426,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-30T20:32:46.349250,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/citation/,jngrx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c347j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/relationships/node/,c347j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597e41f06c613b023a8d26b3/,597e41f06c613b023a8d26b3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jngrx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jngrx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jngrx,NA

This remarkable change in the distribution of household income has spurred a great deal of research on the social and economic consequences of exposure to high inequality. However, the empirical record on the effects of income inequality is mixed. In this paper, we suggest that previous research has generally overlooked a simple but important pathway through which inequality might manifest in daily life: inequality shapes the ability of women to outsource domestic labor by hiring others to perform it. One important venue where such dynamics might then manifest is in time spent on housework and in particular in the time divide in housework between women of high and low socio-economic status. We combine micro-data from the 2003-2013 American Time Use Survey with area-level data on income inequality to show the class divide in housework time between women with a college degree and from high earning households and women of lower socio-economic status is wider in more unequal places. We further assess whether this gap can be explained by domestic outsourcing by combining micro-data from the 2003-2013 Consumer Expenditure Survey with area-level inequality and show that the gap in spending for household services between households of high and low socio-economic status also increases in contexts of higher inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,American Time Use Survey|Consumer Expenditure Survey|Domestic labor|Housework|Income inequality|Inequality|Outsourcing|Time-use,2018-07-02T11:05:23.970659,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-28T17:45:52.644024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/citation/,pwny5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7rs2t/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/relationships/node/,7rs2t,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597b77049ad5a1022d7da573/,597b77049ad5a1022d7da573,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwny5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pwny5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pwny5,NA

Research on the work–family interface has predominantly focused on conflicting roles. In contrast, this paper extends research on work–family enrichment (WFE), a positive aspect of work and gender differences in WFE in a cross-national context. Drawing upon social role theory and the culture sensitive theory on work–family enrichment, we examined gender differences in experiences of developmental WFE in a sample of service sector employees in eight European countries. In line with traditional gender roles, women reported more WFE than men. The relationship was moderated by both an objective and subjective measure of gender egalitarianism but in the opposite direction as hypothesized. The gender gap in WFE was larger in more gender-egalitarian countries, where women may be better able to transfer resources from the work domain to benefit their family role than in low egalitarian societies. National differences in labor market factors, family models and the public discourse on work–life balance mainly explain the unanticipated findings.",TRUE,FALSE,Europe|Gender inequality|International comparison|Work-family conflict|Work-family enrichment|Work-life balance,2018-07-02T11:05:23.844495,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-28T15:22:05.988503,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",The authors,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/citation/,vzphs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c92mj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/relationships/node/,c92mj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597b5477594d900245393d60/,597b5477594d900245393d60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzphs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vzphs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vzphs,https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2017.1355837

This debate largely sidesteps two questions that are central to understanding the future of international order: how strong is the current Western hegemonic order and what is the likelihood that China can or will lead a successful counter-hegemonic challenge? We argue that the future of international order is shaped not only by material power but also by the distribution of identity across the great powers. We develop a constructivist account of hegemonic transition that theorizes the role of the distribution of identity in international order. In our account, hegemonic orders depend on a legitimating ideology that must be consistent with the distribution of identity at both the level of elites and masses. We map the distribution of identity across nine great powers and assess how this distribution supports the current Western neoliberal democratic hegemony. We conclude that China is unlikely to become the hegemon in the near-term. First, the present order is strongly supported by the distribution of identity in both Western states and rising powers like India and Brazil. Second, China is unlikely to join the present order and lead a transition from within because its authoritarian identity conflicts with the democratic ideology of the present order. Finally, China is unlikely to lead a counter-hegemonic coalition of great powers because it will be difficult to build an appealing, universal ideology consistent with the identities of other great powers.",TRUE,FALSE,American decline|China|discourse|discourse analysis|distribution of identity|hegemonic transition|hegemony|international order|national identity,2018-07-02T11:05:23.424033,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-27T03:48:58.744839,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Bentley Allan|Srdjan Vucetic and Ted Hopf,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/citation/,f8hwe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v3kta/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/relationships/node/,v3kta,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/597961199ad5a1023a58e8ba/,597961199ad5a1023a58e8ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f8hwe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f8hwe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f8hwe,NA

Anecdotal evidence about the meaning of the term suggests that a mix of both accurate data and misinformation can abound.  We sought to uncover what range of meanings the term ‘undetectable’ holds for a cohort of HIV testers at a free HIV testing facility along mid-Market St, San Francisco.
Design:  A four question survey with additional demographic questions was administered to 130 individuals at the testing site.  The resulting answers were then coded as ‘informed’, ‘uninformed’, or ‘misinformed’ and correlated with demographic measures, including residential zip code of the respondent.
Results: Residents in the Castro district were most likely to associate ‘undetectable’ status with medication adherence.  The most misinformed zip code with respect to the meaning and implications of the term ‘undetectable’ was the Tenderloin, which corresponds to the San Francisco zip code with the lowest rates of HIV suppression. Compared to MSMs, heterosexuals were the most uninformed; while racially, Asians were the most misinformed and Blacks the least misinformed.  Older men seem most cautious about using ‘undetectable’ as a risk-reduction strategy.
Significance: The study highlights the degree to which certain neighbourhoods and demographics have assimilated the concept of ‘undetectable’ and how viral suppression is maintained, while pinpointing neighbourhoods for additional outreach to correct identified misinformation.",TRUE,FALSE,adherence|ARV|Castro|getting to zero|HIV|MSM|San Francisco|Tenderloin|undetectable|viral load|viral suppression,2018-07-02T11:05:23.298421,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-26T19:50:36.525856,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/citation/,8xutp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8v9up/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/relationships/node/,8v9up,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5978f1949ad5a1023857c933/,5978f1949ad5a1023857c933,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xutp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xutp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xutp,NA
