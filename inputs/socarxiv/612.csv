Schooling has been made compulsory for all children under fourteen. The government spending on education is being raised to six per cent of the GDP. Incentives are being given to schools with best student and teacher attendance. The Government sponsored Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Universal Elementary Education), focuses on increasing enrolment rates and reducing drop-out rates. The reasons for dropout in the primary education system have been persistently disturbing not only in an emerging economy like India but also in other developing countries. Dropout by children does not mean mere refusal of attending school. It leads to wastage of the funds invested in school buildings, teachers’ salaries, equipment, textbooks and so on.

Coastal tourism and recreation are important parts of the largest and most rapidly growing activity in the world--- international tourism. Tourism and recreation-related development is one of the major factors shaping development patterns in the coastal zones of India. Hence, any analysis of India’s interests in coasts and oceans must take account of its interrelated activities.

Instead of assuming members of parliaments' (MPs) intrinsic motivations to be underlying immigrants' substantive representation, we highlight extrinsic motives. Drawing on principal-agent theory, we conceptualise MPs as delegates who follow the instructions of their main principals, constituents and party bodies. On this basis, we study the link between institutional variables and substantive representation. Based on an analysis of more than 20,000 parliamentary questions for written answer tabled in the 17th German Bundestag (2009-13), we find that immigrants' substantive representation hinges strongly on the demands of MPs' principals. However, our empirical analysis suggests that electoral rules do not influence the relationships between MPs and their principals, while candidate selection methods as well as powerful parliamentary party group leaderships do.",TRUE,FALSE,Bundestag|Germany|Immigrant-origin citizens|Parliamentary institutions|Parliamentary questions|Substantive representation,2018-07-02T11:45:22.514469,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T12:53:23.512648,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/citation/,xu3gh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ver2z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/relationships/node/,ver2z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab1021d80f2d3000d5b7a4a/,5ab1021d80f2d3000d5b7a4a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xu3gh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xu3gh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xu3gh,NA

Recommendations for Researchers Based on a Simulation Study,"Does X affect Y? Answering this question is particularly difficult if reverse causality is looming. Many social scientists turn to panel data to address such questions of causal ordering. Yet even in longitudinal analyses reverse causality threatens causal inference based on conventional panel models. Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags.",TRUE,FALSE,Causal Inference|Dynamic Panel Models|Exogeneity|Fixed Effects|Panel Data|Reverse Causality,2018-07-02T11:43:53.898733,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-20T12:18:15.292273,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Lars Leszczensky &amp; Tobias Wolbring,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/citation/,8xb4z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4h8nu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/relationships/node/,4h8nu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aafcfabfb9476000c2881e6/,5aafcfabfb9476000c2881e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xb4z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xb4z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xb4z,NA

Is there really a difference between a virtual reality experience and reading an article when it comes to inducing empathy?  In this experimental study, we gave participants a pre-test and post-test survey regarding their empathy, attitudes and intentions toward immigrants, refugees and endangered animals.  Between the surveys, randomly selected participants engaged with a virtual reality experience relating to the U.S.-Mexican border, and others read an article on the same topic.  A virtual reality experience increased participants' empathy toward immigrants, led to more positive attitudes toward immigration and increased the participants' stated likelihood of taking political action in favor of immigrants.  However, in almost all cases these increases were statistically indistinguishable from the increase due to reading a print article.

Yet, we know little about the decision-making processes that lead to such outcomes. To address this gap, I conducted a longitudinal interview study of 21 heterosexual young adult couples who were deciding whether to move for early career opportunities. Analyzing 118 interviews, I detail how partners negotiate their desired work and family arrangements given structural and cultural constraints. On one negotiation trajectory, partners maintained their egalitarian desires by performing practical labor to make equal work–family arrangements. On another pathway, couples changed their desires by doing emotion work to justify neotraditional
roles. On the last pathway, men deferred to women’s desires, unintentionally leaving
women the emotional and practical work of coordinating two careers and the couple’s
life. These pathways show how couples contest and reproduce gendered work and family roles during the stalled gender revolution.",TRUE,FALSE,dual-career couples|family migration|gender schemas|life-course methods|work/family,2018-07-02T11:43:50.466579,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-16T16:37:44.053105,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/citation/,s3cqf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wc9p3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/relationships/node/,wc9p3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aabe002fb9476000f50649e/,5aabe002fb9476000f50649e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s3cqf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s3cqf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s3cqf,https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243217695520
