Using the comparative advantage theory formalized by David Ricardo (1772-1823) as an analytical tool, we consider the arguments of major contemporary Japanese policymakers as the object of analysis. We have three conclusions. First, the economic policy adopted by early Meiji policymakers generally followed the comparative advantage theory. Second, their goal was not the monoculturization of the comparative advantage goods, but the heavy industrialization necessary for avoiding the colonization: export of comparative advantage goods was a means to collect money for it. Third, they regarded the development of transportation-related industries as important because it would hasten the “movement” of men and goods, which would lead to the increased wealth and which was symbolized by the kurofune in the collective memory.",TRUE,FALSE,19th Century|Collective Memory|Comparative Advantage Theory|Early Meiji Japan|Industrialization,2020-11-04T18:54:02.608062,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-04T18:53:41.587487,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History,Naoki Odanaka,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/citation/,a2x3e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa14879ced992003c79c2f0/,5fa14879ced992003c79c2f0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2x3e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a2x3e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a2x3e,NA

Most existing answers to this question rely on one- dimensional macro-measures of effectiveness, such as battle fatalities. This paper proposes another perspective that is based on the point of view of local residents in countries that host United Nations peacekeepers. It argues that their support is an indicator of success, since they evaluate the institutional effectiveness of the peacekeepers they are exposed to. Using an aggregation of longitudinal data from the World Values Survey (N=25,196), and original data on the exposure to peacekeepers collected from the United Nations archives, we offer a unique, systematic and cross- national measurement of the local legitimacy of peacekeeping forces. Results from a multilevel, mixed-effects, linear model show significantly lower levels of confidence in the United Nations and higher levels of demand for the accountability of its forces in countries with an active peacekeeping operation. The level of confidence has a strong and negative correlation with the size of the mission, even when controlled for varied ideological explanations and for confidence extrapolation.

Through Lovenduski’s framework of ‘feminising politics‘, and Dean and Maiguashca’s ‘feministisation’ analytical criteria, this qualitative study seeks to identify the process of ‘feministisation’ that has been taken place in Galician nationalism, the role of women activists in this process and the obstacles encountered; ultimately assessing this ‘feministisation’ as a strategy to find a path towards reconciliation.

Based on the experiences of women activists collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews, the study has identified that the alliance of feminism and nationalism has allowed international and local networks to be interwoven, and it has also positioned feminist values and gender analysis at the core of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG), one of the institutional organisations within Galician nationalism. Additionally, it has defined ‘feministisation’ as a complex process where the wide context of an internal crisis, the years of collective work by feminist groups and individuals, and the current hegemonic acceptance of feminism in Galician society have played their part. The study concludes that there is substantial evidence to identify a process of feministisation that is taking place within the Galician Nationalist Bloc and that the characteristics and values of this process could become a strategy to forge a path towards a more tolerant and internationalist reconciliation.",TRUE,FALSE,Bloque Nacionalista Galego|Feminism|Feministisation|Galician Nationalism|Nationalism,2020-11-03T08:39:02.543981,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-03T08:38:39.538762,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d05|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Women's Studies",Birkbeck|University of London,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/citation/,5zvq6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa07d41b1ea1705cdc93372/,5fa07d41b1ea1705cdc93372,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zvq6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zvq6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5zvq6,NA

Today, political marketing and advertising for persons seeking elective posts analyze, develop, execute and manage campaigns as a way of driving public opinion (Laing &amp; Khattab, 2016). Social media provides a platform on which one can engage with the so-called connected generation. If the November 2016 elections are anything to go by, Twitter proved to be the medium of choice for citizens to engage and consume political content (Le et al., 2017). Ideally, tweets formed the basis of facilitating user engagement through the provision of content and newsbreaks. By extension, the mentioned discussions would influence the political discourse while establishing the capacity to determine the events of mainstream media. 
	This study seeks to establish social media usage by President Donald Trump before and after his election. An understanding of such trend is essential in inferring as to whether Social media, in this case Twitter, plays a role in the current political spheres by promoting influence of a given aspirant. This stems from various studies that have stated that there is an association between social media use and an aspirant’s influence of the connected generation who are especially the youths. For instance, a thesis by Hwang (2016) observed that President Trump’s Twitter usage contributes to his political poll success which he associates with a reflection of his personality in the media use. This was also observed by Lilleker, Jackson, Thorsen and Veneti (2016) who stated that President Trump’s media use contributed to his election. It would hence be essential to understand President Trump’s nature of usage of Twitter. 
Allcott and Gentzkow (2017) conducted a study in which they observed use of fake news to influence people into certain political alignments. Twitter was also observed as one of the channels through which fake news was distributed. This study might help to create a foundation under which more studies can be done to determine the association of social media with other issues facing the society such as fake news and environment issues and their role on presidential elections. It would also be worth noting that there has been high politicization of President Trump’s use of Twitter especially during his Campaigns. This study would hence help to infer whether there is a change in this factor after his election.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-03T06:53:21.357011,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-03T06:52:50.394586,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/citation/,zcnqs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9ffe2bb1ea17059bc93ad1/,5f9ffe2bb1ea17059bc93ad1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zcnqs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zcnqs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zcnqs,NA

Objective: To identify recommendations for conducting public health research with trauma-exposed populations. 

Methods: Researchers searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Open Grey, and Google Scholar for recommendations. Trauma that causes psychological impact was our exposure of interest and we excluded clinical articles on treating physical trauma. We reviewed titles and abstracts of 6,234 articles and full text of 174  articles. We analyzed recommendations with thematic analysis, generated questions from the existing pool of recommendations, and then summarized select gaps.   

Results: We abstracted recommendations from 69 articles in five categories: community benefit, participant benefit, safety, researcher well-being, and recommendations for conduct of trauma research. 

Conclusions:  Gold standards to guide the conduct of trauma-informed public health research do not yet exist. The literature suggests participation in trauma research is not inherently harmful, and current recommendations concern using research to benefit communities and participants, protecting participants and researchers from harm, and improving professional practice. As public health researchers increasingly analyze trauma as a determinant of health, gold standards for the conduct of trauma-informed public health research would be appropriate and timely.",TRUE,FALSE,Research Ethics/Guidelines|Trauma|Trauma-informed Research,2020-11-03T06:52:02.164328,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-03T06:51:38.163108,FALSE,NA,no,Data are shareable upon request but are not presently in a repository or collection.,,no,We do not have a preregistration to reference because our paper was out of scope to be included in PROSPERO.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/citation/,f235e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n87am/,n87am,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9f21d210172104d3a48874/,5f9f21d210172104d3a48874,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f235e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f235e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f235e,NA

It lacks an adequately staffed, sustainable, coordinated healthcare system to tend to its population’s needs. Ongoing conflict, lack of electricity and running water, and poor sanitation compound the issue. High rates of poverty and the ongoing land, air, and sea blockade also exacerbate the situation. This paper serves as a policy recommendation to create the Gaza Medical Reserves (Reserves), an organization of Public Health Preventive Medicine (PHPM) specialists (reservists) who would be trained in emergency and crisis care to provide aid during turmoil, war, epidemics, and pandemics, such as COVID–19. During non–crisis, peaceful times, reservists will provide primary care services currently unavailable in Gaza. They will target those who are most needy in underserved neighborhoods and refugee camps.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Gaza|healthcare management|health policy|health reform|Medical Reserve Corps|Palestine|public health,2020-11-01T15:59:22.228141,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-01T15:59:04.561554,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/citation/,hktpj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9eb8f710172104b3a427b9/,5f9eb8f710172104b3a427b9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hktpj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hktpj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hktpj,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0192

The same organization existed under several different names between 1925 and 1969. As perhaps the only sustained effort in New York by a black-led organization to focus specifically on the problems of blacks as both workers and trade unionists, the NLC evokes considerable interest. Drawing on the NLC's written records, this paper argues that the NLC's overarching loyalty to the labor movement led it to underestimate the efficacy of organizing blacks through community institutions toward goals defined in terms of the community's interest. Thus, the NLC sacrificed racial solidarity for trade union solidarity, only to find that most white unions in the American Federation of Labor (AFL) were more committed to the former than to the latter.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-01T11:10:22.203515,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-01T11:10:11.135881,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20747#descriptive_identity,no,The paper offers a historical analysis of publicly available archival documents.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/citation/,3hq86,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9daa601017210465a43558/,5f9daa601017210465a43558,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3hq86/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3hq86/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3hq86,NA

This paper explores the power of weaponized narratives on social media both to create and polarize communities and to mobilize collective action and even violence. We propose that focusing on invocation of specific narratives and the patterns of narrative combination provides insight into the shared sense of identity and meaning different groups derive from these narratives. We then develop the WARP (Weaponize, Activate, Radicalize, Persuade) framework for understanding the strategic deployment and presentation of narratives in relation to group identity building and individual responses. The approach and framework provide powerful tools for investigating the way narratives may be used both to speak to a core audience of believers while also introducing and engaging new and even initially unreceptive audience segments to potent cultural messages, potentially inducting them into a process of radicalization and mobilization.",TRUE,FALSE,influence operations|narrative|radicalization|social media|weaponized narratives,2020-11-01T11:13:41.823770,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-01T11:13:19.616967,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/information-operations.html,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/citation/,87zmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9ca120b1ea17049ac93ae1/,5f9ca120b1ea17049ac93ae1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/87zmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/87zmk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/87zmk,NA
