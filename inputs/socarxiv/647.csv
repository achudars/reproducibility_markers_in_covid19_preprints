The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N=3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems.

This work explains how the mechanisms of poverty regulation interact with local citizenship practices. In effect, the access of the poor to social rights and the exercise of their political rights are both object of a process of regulation by family values ​​in a context of strong social inequalities. Beyond the fact that social assistance depends on family organisation, the implementation of the ‘Bolsa Família’ Programme is based on informal rules, reflecting the dominant social representations of poverty in Brazil. In addition, the allocation of social benefits depends in part on personalised rapports between the programme’s beneficiaries and political candidates and elected representatives. This work is based on a case study in the Northeast region of Brazil—in a middle-sized municipality of the Ceará state. An ethnographic approach allowed the identification of the logic of operation of a political machine involving social assistance, elected officials, social workers and beneficiaries.

The reasons for this increase are not well understood, nor are what factors might protect people’s access to food. Here we test the hypothesis that an emerging gap between food prices and wages can explain increases in reported inability to afford protein-rich foods and whether welfare regimes can mitigate its impact. We collected data on 21 countries from 2004-2012 on food prices and deprivation related to food, denoted by reported in ability to afford to eat meat, chicken, fish or a vegetarian equivalent, every second day, from EuroStat 2015 edition and on wages from the OECD 2015 edition. After adjusting for macroeconomic factors, we found that each 1% rise in the price of food over and above wages was associated with greater self-reported food deprivation (β = 0.063, 95% CI: 0.033 to 0.092); particularly among impoverished groups. But, this association also varied across welfare regimes. In Eastern European welfare regimes, a 1% rise in the price of food over wages was associated with a 0.081 percentage point rise in food deprivation (95% CI: 0.051 to 0.11) while in Social Democratic welfare regimes we find no clear association (p = 0.37).

performance organization and customer satisfaction. Aim to this research an investigate influence of internal marketing
toward internal service quality with impact to the internal customer satisfaction at Tourism Industry in Yogyakarta Special of Territory. The sample size was 420 respondent with propusive sampling use to determine the sample. The main instrument in this study is questionaire. The analysis used to examine the hypothesis of the study is Structural Equation Modeling using AMOS Version 20.0 Software. The result of the study show that: Internal marketing influence toward internal quality service. Internal marketing and internal quality service significanly influence toward internal costumer satisfation. Never theless, the internal quality service more significanly influence to the internal customer satisfaction than internal marketing. Therefore manager in tourism industry should be improve more the internal marketing than internal quality service.

The results supposed to be contributed as scientific journal and other scientific work, which is valuable for scientific improvement in provincial autonomy law. It surely could be used by the local governments in Indonesia and hopefully in Asia as a framework to construct a strategic procedure of the village development. This study uses the conceptual approach and analysis approach as methods. The conceptual approach directed to examine the first legal issue related to differ autonomy concept in Law number 5 of 1979 and Law Number 6 of 2014 while the analytical approach is used for assessing the alignment of the concept of village autonomy in Law Number 6, 2014 with a constitutional mandate. Research activity begins with establishing the legal issue through review the primary legal materials, followed by research on secondary law as a theoretical source for legal analysis of emerging issues. Once the overall legal materials collected, the legal issues in the primary legal materials be analyzed.

Convex hulls are widely used in computer science, and have been applied in fields such as ecology, but are heretofore underutilized in population studies.  We briefly discuss convex hulls, then we show how they may profitably be applied to demography.  We do this through three examples, drawn from the relationship between child mortality and adult survivorship (5q0 and 45p15 in life table notation).  The three examples are: (i) sex differences in mortality; (ii) period and cohort differences and (iii) outlier identification.  Convex hulls can be useful in robust compilation of demographic databases. Moreover, the gap/lag framework for sex differences or period/cohort differences is more complex when mortality data are arrayed by two components as opposed to a unidimensional measure such as life expectancy.  Our examples show how, in certain cases, convex hulls can identify patterns in demographic data more readily than other techniques.  The potential applicability of convex hulls in population studies goes beyond mortality.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|mortality,2018-07-02T10:52:09.538665,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-03-25T01:05:01.552000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/citation/,szxvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pucwd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/relationships/node/,pucwd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58d5c035b83f690044545693/,58d5c035b83f690044545693,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/szxvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/szxvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/szxvx,https://doi.org/10.14428/rqj2019.07.01.02
