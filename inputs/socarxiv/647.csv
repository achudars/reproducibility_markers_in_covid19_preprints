Although macroeconomic stance is of paramount importance for contemporary governments, our understanding of its popular politics is limited. We argue that popular attitudes regarding austerity are influenced by media (and wider elite) framing. Information necessary to form preferences on the deficit is not provided neutrally, and its provision shapes how voters understand their interests.   A wide range of evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim.  In the British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public borrowing --- in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their readerships.

Test procedural justice theory by examining the extent to which procedural justice mediates the impact of contact with the police on various outcomes. Apply causal mediation analysis to better interpret data from a field experiment that had suffered from a particular type of implementation failure.

Methods: Data from a block-randomised controlled trial of procedural justice policing (the Scottish Community Engagement Trial) were analysed. All constructs were measured using surveys distributed during roadside police checks. The treatment implementation was assessed by analysing the treatment effect consistency and heterogeneity. Causal mediation analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to assess the mediating role of procedural justice.

Results: First, the treatment effect was consistent and fairly homogeneous, indicating that the systematic variation in the study is attributable to the design. Second, procedural justice acts as a mediator channelling the treatment’s effect towards normative alignment (NIE=-0.207), duty to obey (NIE=-0.153), sense of power (NIE=-0.078), and social identity (NIE=-0.052), all of which are moderately robust to unmeasured confounding. The NIEs for risk of sanction and personal morality were highly sensitive, while for coerced obligation and sense of power they were non-significant.
 
Conclusions: Causal mediation analysis is a versatile tool that can salvage experiments with systematic yet ambiguous treatment effects by allowing researchers to “pry open” the black box of causality. Most of the theoretical propositions of procedural justice policing were supported. Future studies are needed with more discernible causal mediation effects.",TRUE,FALSE,Causal inference|Causal mediation analysis|Police legitimacy|Potential outcome framework|Procedural justice policing|Sensitivity analysis,2018-07-02T11:25:50.833812,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-29T17:56:05.682630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Krisztián Pósch,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/citation/,9x7n6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u8kxs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/relationships/node/,u8kxs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a1e9be7b83f69027cbfdbb3/,5a1e9be7b83f69027cbfdbb3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9x7n6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9x7n6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9x7n6

Therefore, referring to ordinary settlement agreement, the grantee cannot claim the propriety of some property against persons other than grantor, but in the case of denial of the occurrence of a transaction between the parties to the settlement, the beneficiary can refer to the ordinary document of that transaction to prove the occurrence of the transaction between themself and the other person, and such a reference is reviewable by the court. In addition to that the grantor and grantee can refer to ordinary document and any provable evidence in their controversy and dispute about the settlement subject and prove the occurrence of settlement, the grantee can bring an action against the grantor and obligate them to arrange an official settlement document by proving the settlement and by invoking to Article 220 of the Civil Code, because according to the mentioned article, transactors are not only committed to what is stated in the contract, but are also committed to all the results of the contract in accordance with customs or law. However, if a dispute occurs between the grantee and a third party about the settlement subject and an action is brought, then if the grantee presents the ordinary settlement document to prove their ownership, the court according to the Registration Law will not consider that document effective, and the grantee may even be convicted against the third party. The settlement is not correct if its provisions arecontrary to the law, order and the general rules, and if the settlement document arranged in a notary office has a substantive, procedural or legal problem then the competent legal authorities such as the High Council of Registry investigate the issue and the provisions applicable will be issued.",TRUE,FALSE,Grantee|Grantor|Official document|Sanction of settlement contract|Settlement contract,2018-07-02T11:25:47.623223,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-28T17:07:57.543386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0e|Law|Privacy Law,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/citation/,q4rws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3ynms/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/relationships/node/,3ynms,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a1d2bfa594d90026ff2b444/,5a1d2bfa594d90026ff2b444,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q4rws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q4rws/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q4rws

In this paper I consider smart cities from a temporal perspective arguing that they produce a new timescape and constitute space-time machines. The first half of the paper examines temporal relations and rhythms, exploring how smart cities are the products of and contribute to space-time compression, create new urban polyrhythms, alter the practices of scheduling, and change the pace and tempos of everyday activities. The second half of the paper details how smart cities shape the nature of temporal modalities, considering how they reframe and utilise the relationship between the past, present and future. The analysis draws from a set of 43 interviews conducted in Dublin, Ireland, and highlights that much of the power of smart urbanism is derived from how it produces a new timescape, rather than simply reconfiguring spatial relations.",TRUE,FALSE,future|pace|past|present|real-time|rhythm|scheduling|smart cities|space-time|tempo|temporality|time|timescape,2018-07-02T11:25:46.733734,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-27T18:08:08.766200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/citation/,y4e8p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pmgsj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/relationships/node/,pmgsj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a1be41d9ad5a10268ce3d29/,5a1be41d9ad5a10268ce3d29,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y4e8p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y4e8p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y4e8p
