conflicting answers, and little large-scale research on the question
exists. Most quantitative research on race and unionization studies trends
in membership rather than the outcome of specific organizing drives, and
assumes that the main problem is mistrust between workers and unions,
paying less attention for example to the role of employers. I explore the
role of racial and ethnic diversity in the outcomes of nearly 7,000
organizing drives launched between 1999 and 2008. By matching the National
Labor Relations Board’s information on union activity with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission’s surveys of large establishments, I
reconstruct the demographic composition of the work groups involved in each
mobilization. I find that more diverse establishments are less likely to
see successful organizing attempts. However, I find little evidence that
this is because workers are less interested in voting for unions. Instead,
I find that the organizers of more diverse units are more likely to give up
before such elections are held. Furthermore, this higher quit rate can be
explained best by the other organizations involved in the organizing drive.
In particular, employers are more likely to be charged with unfair labor
practices when the unit in question is more racially diverse. This effect
persists when controlling for heterogeneity among industries, unions and

In this article, we explore the impact of technical interdependence on the

job structure through these interdependencies are more likely to survive.
We test our theory on a quarter-century of personnel and job-description

universities.  Our results provide support for our key hypotheses: jobs
that are more enmeshed in clusters of technical interdependence are less
likely to die. At the same time, being part of such a cluster means that a
job is more vulnerable if its neighbors disappear. And the ""protection"" of
technical interdependence is contingent: it does not hold in the face of

It has special global significance for its record of early pelagic fishing and ancient shell fish hooks. It is also of regional significance for its early occupation and comparatively large assemblage of Pleistocene stone artefacts. Three major findings arise from our study of the stone artefacts. First, there is little change in lithic technology over the 42,000 year sequence, with the most noticeable change being the addition of new artefact types and raw materials in the mid-Holocene. Second, the assemblage is dominated by small chert cores and implements rather than pebble toolsand choppers, a pattern we argue is common in island SE Asian sites as opposed to mainland SE Asian sites. Third, the Jerimalai assemblage bears a striking resemblance to the assemblage from Liang Bua, argued by the Liang Bua excavation team to be associated with Homo floresiensis. We argue that the near proximity of these two islands along the Indonesian Island chain (c.100km apart), the long antiquity of modern human occupation in the region (as documented at Jerimalai), and the strong resemblance of distinctive flake stone technologies seen at both sites, raises the intriguing possibility that both the Liang Bua and Jerimalai assemblages were created by modern humans.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:27.018650,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-16T16:00:17.805000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/citation/,63zey,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rj655/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/relationships/node/,rj655,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57e5caf99ad5a101fb77c765/,57e5caf99ad5a101fb77c765,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zey/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/63zey/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/63zey

While in other countries these tax credits were refundable, the United States alone introduced a nonrefundable CTC. As a result, the United States was the only country in which poor and working-class families were paradoxically excluded from these new benefits. A comparative analysis of Canada and the United States shows that American exceptionalism resulted from the cultural legacy of distinct public policies. We argue that policy changes in the 1940s institutionalized different ""logics of appropriateness"" that later constrained policymakers in the 1990s. Specifically, the introduction of family allowances in Canada and other LWR countries naturalized a logic of income supplementation in which families could legitimately receive cash benefits without the stigma of ""welfare."" Lacking this policy legacy, American attempts to introduce a refundable CTC were quickly derailed by policymakers who saw it as equivalent to welfare. Instead, they introduced a narrow, nonrefundable CTC under the alternative logic of ""tax relief,"" even though this meant excluding the lowest-income families.

However, prior scholarship generally assumes that the returns to education do not change over time or geographic space. Absolute educational effects are not always plausible; as more individuals obtain a college degree, there are a greater number of qualified individuals competing for the same social resources. The present study tests the impact of education on civic participation, and whether this effect changes as the number of college-educated individuals increases over birth cohorts. The present findings suggest that in some cases, a college degree's impact on civic participation declines as more individuals obtain college degrees. The findings challenge commonly held assumptions about the effect of higher education on civic participation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that while sending an individual to college may increase civic participation, encouraging all high school students to go to college may undercut the benefits of college attendance.

Prior research suggests that various job quality dimensions such as job security and individual task discretion affect subjective well-being, but the theoretical mechanisms are implied rather than tested and aspects of job quality are rarely tested together. I use structural equation modeling and General Social Survey data to assess the impact of five job quality dimensions-individual task discretion, monetary compensation, job security, low work intensity, and safe work conditions-on subjective well-being. Then, I show that job quality influences subjective well-being by improving social life, altering class identification, affecting physical health, and increased amount of leisure time. Finally, while I find that job quality dimensions do have statistically significant effects on subjective well-being, the way in which job quality affects subjective well-being differs by job dimension. In other words, job quality has a statistically significant impact on subjective well-being, but different job quality domains are connected to subjective well-being in different ways.
