In the first place, his formulation of the dogma is ambiguous: it can be read in at least four different ways. Secondly, his arguments against the dogma are only able to refute the strongest version of it. The second part of the paper considers the idea that covering laws have a constitutive role in singular causal explanation and argues that this idea is not plausible. Consequently, the only defensible form of the dogma is the one that claims that all explanations can be reconstructed as deductive arguments.",TRUE,FALSE,contrast|deductive chauvinism|dogma|explanation|Wesley Salmon,2018-07-02T11:03:30.059257,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-16T05:26:36.688213,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/citation/,ufnbv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3qbku/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/relationships/node/,3qbku,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596af8ab6c613b02291928ab/,596af8ab6c613b02291928ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufnbv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufnbv/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10699-004-5249-y,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufnbv

I will restrict my discussion to singular causal explanation, but the basic ideas and the arguments have a broader application. They are relevant also to other kinds of explanations. In the first section I will first present the intuitive idea of contrastive questions, and then elaborate it by discussing typical criteria for the choice of a contrast. I also suggest a novel way to see the difference between scientific and everyday explanatory questions. In the second section I will discuss the major criticisms presented against contrastive theories of explanation in order to further clarify my position. I argue that all explananda can be analyzed as contrastive and that this is a fruitful approach in understanding explanatory questions. I also argue that the contrastive thesis should be understood as a claim about what an explanation can explain, not as a thesis about what the explainee has in her mind. Finally, I defend the thesis that a contrastive explanandum can be reduced to a non-contrastive explanandum against the arguments presented by Dennis Temple and John W.

In this chapter I will employ a well-known scientific research heuristic of studying how something works by focusing on circumstances in which it does not work. Rather than trying to describe what scientific understanding would ideally look like, I will try to learn something about it by looking at mundane cases where understanding is partly illusory. The main thesis of this paper will be the following: scientists are prone to the illusion of depth of understanding (IDU), and as a consequence, they sometimes overestimate the detail, coherence, and depth of their understanding. I will start my argument by presenting an analysis of the notion of understanding and its relation to a sense of understanding. In order to make plausible the claim that these are often disconnected, I will describe an interesting series of psychological experiments by Frank Keil and co-authors. These experiments suggest that ordinary people routinely overestimate the depth of their understanding. In Section 3, I will argue that we should take seriously the possibility that scientific cognition is also affected by IDU. Section 4 will spell out some possible causes of explanatory illusions in science. In the final section, I will discuss how scientific explanatory practices could be improved and how the philosophy of science might be able to contribute to this process.",TRUE,FALSE,explanation|explanatory cognition|illusion|understanding,2018-07-02T11:03:29.965302,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-16T05:13:50.882778,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/citation/,qz7sg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ywnpf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/relationships/node/,ywnpf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596af5856c613b022b192603/,596af5856c613b022b192603,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qz7sg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qz7sg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qz7sg

The Impact of M-PESA’s Network Power on Development as Freedom","The role of ICTs in development is contested between those who believe they will facilitate human development and those who believe they are, at most, impotent, and at worst, counterproductive. This article uses an examination of M-PESA, a large-scale mobile financial service in Kenya, to argue that the impact of ICTs on development as freedom differs with both the specific conceptualization of freedom used, and the institutional arrangement of the technology in question. The article’s novel conceptual model links the adoption of mobile money to its impact, suggesting that the dominant individualistic and instrumental approaches to ICT4D overlook the ways in which power and domination function alongside freedom when these factors are considered relationally and substantively. I demonstrate that the internal plurality of the concept of freedom leads to both new forms of empowerment, but also to limitations on choice and new forms of dominance.

These initiatives, which typically provide small cash grants to poor populations, are often considered particularly agreeable for the simplicity of their administration and the feasibility of their implementation. This paper examines the background work required to deploy social protection in one especially remote area: the margins of postcolonial Kenya. Specifically, it documents the often overlooked social and technical construction of the infrastructure necessary so that cash transfers may function with the ease and simplicity for which they are commended. Attention to the practice of ‘infrastructuring’ offers insights into the tensions and politics of what is rapidly become a key form of transnational govermentality in the global South, showing that humanitarian rationalities and subjects cannot be understood independently of the material networks on which they rely.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:03:29.606809,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-15T13:56:41.734108,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/citation/,gc2ft,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ane9r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/relationships/node/,ane9r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596a1ec8b83f69023fbffb29/,596a1ec8b83f69023fbffb29,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gc2ft/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gc2ft/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0263775815598107,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gc2ft

Despite decades of work devoted to the politics, histories, and techniques of surveillance and control in Western societies, there is very little work on the local exigencies and manifestations of surveillance in African contexts.
