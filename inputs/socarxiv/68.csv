Citizens’ competencies necessary for successful interactions with public administration are an important resource that remains widely neglected. While interactions with public organizations impose a considerable administrative burden on citizens, that burden may differ quite significantly depending on their available resources to cope with such a burden. Research from other fields such as data or health literacy suggests that these concepts influence a variety of outcomes for both the individual and society. Such competence may change behavior and perception when interacting with public organizations, indicating its potential as an important factor influencing behavior such as compliance, and other outcomes.

Adult children moving out is an important event in parents’ lives. However, it is theoretically unclear whether parental well-being decreases or increases from children moving out. Children moving out can relief parents’ burdens (e.g. housework) and lead to a change in parental roles, with adverse consequences for parental well-being. This study uses long-running panel data (1991-2016) from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to investigate the relationship between child move and parental well-being using fixed effects dummy impact functions. The findings suggest that differentiating between first and empty nest moves is important when investigating the effects of children moving out of the parental home on parental well-being, as only the first move shows a long lasting negative effect on parental well-being.

The review reveals that serious asymmetries, defined by socioeconomic status and territorial division, prevail in Panama. The discontent generated by difficulties in accessing online education triggered wide coverage by the media. In most cases, however, media outlets treated this phenomenon with little explanatory depth.

pharmaceutical industry and the lack of self- reliance when it comes to APIs, we first decided
to go with official government data of the APIs being imported from China and work
commenced from there. Based on government data, market share, consumption, pricing of
drugs and import reports, we selected two drugs, one being an anti-bacterial drug which
requires fermentation namely, cephalosporins and the other being a well-known anti-diabetic
drug, Metformin. Currently, we are looking at the various technologies being used in producing
the two drugs which were shortlisted and, we’ll be further finding out the loopholes in the
system and fixing it or suggesting novel techniques to make the Indian Pharmaceutical industry
a powerhouse. Both cephalosporins and metformin have been majorly imported from China
due to several loopholes in producing them here in India and to add to it, the strategic pricing
employed by the Chinese manufacturers gives them an edge over indigenous products. The
manufacturing processes and regulations for both cephalosporins and metformin, need to
undergo an overhaul in order to compete with giants like China and thus displace them from

Insights from a multilevel latent Markov model,"A large body of research suggests that generous welfare provisions for jobseekers create a disincentive to work. Other scholars argue that generous benefits can reduce unemployment by serving as a job-search subsidy. One caveat in this literature is that, when testing the two hypotheses, many scholars conceive of labour markets as homogeneous entities or they theoretically assume a certain insider/outsider divide. In this article, we claim that the employment effect of generous benefits varies between labour market segments. Analysing EU-SILC panel data of 27 European countries, we find that more-generous unemployment cash benefits enhance the transition from unemployment into more-secure work while discouraging transition into less-secure work in terms of temporal, economic and organisational security. Contrary to existing research, welfare generosity is measured by aggregated information on individual benefit receipt.

Here, we observe both the increasing commodification of digital forms of knowledge, as well as the commodification of the access to this knowledge. As predominantly non-commercial spaces, libraries serve the vital function of deflecting these developments. In this article, I argue for going one step further and imagining libraries as institutionalized and pedagogical spaces that can negotiate and transgress their institutional limits vis-à-vis public and private resources, discourses, policies, and technologies for the purpose of furthering the commons. In so doing, libraries serve as alter-neoliberal pedagogies, which democratize the construction and deconstruction of knowledge, as well as the access to them. Here, alternative literacies, ways of learning, and ways of being can be prefigured in practice. In imagining these conceptual potentialities of academic and public libraries, this article sets forth an initial agenda toward the commoning library.",TRUE,FALSE,Austerity|Commodification|Digital Commons|Libraries|library and information science|Neoliberalism|Policy|Privatization|Public Space,2021-03-09T11:04:41.549497,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-09T11:04:14.140382,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Information Literacy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/citation/,g248q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604737d759e910005982b8f3/,604737d759e910005982b8f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g248q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g248q/,https://doi.org/10.33621/jdsr.v3i1.58,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g248q
