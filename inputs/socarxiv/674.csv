To convey the message, translators need to take into account not only the text, but also extra linguistic factors such as the target audience. The present paper claims that adaptation is an unavoidable translation strategy when dealing with texts that are heavy with religious and cultural themes. The translation task becomes even more challenging when dealing with children’s literature as the audience is children whose comprehension, experience and world knowledge is limited. The study uses the Arabic translation of the short story “Christmas Every Day” by William Dean Howells (1837- 1920) as a case study.

The study attempts to achieve these aims by looking at the pragmatic concept of presupposition in translation studies, guided by micro-translation strategies of cultural themes. The study employs Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (1943) and Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions (1984) to analyze the translation of three cultural themes: methods of persuasion, stereotypes, and humor. Further themes, per each cultural themes are explored: persuasion through foreignization, persuasion through localization of norms and preferences, persuasion through adapting types of register, portraying the Arab culture as storytellers, verbalizing stereotypes through linguistic clichés and idioms, hyperbole in humor, and modification of irony in humor.

The overuse and the misuse of translation in the heydays of these methods paved the way to the monolingual assumption that English should be taught without the inclusion of translation activities in the classroom. However, in the last few decades, there has been ongoing research re-evaluating the use of translation in the EFL context. Drawing upon several studies conducted in this respect, researchers discussed the main objections raised against the use of translation and set the benefits of this teaching tool in facilitating the students’ language learning process. On the basis of the findings of these studies, the present article aims at exploring teachers’ attitudes towards the use and usefulness of translation in English classes in the Algerian EFL context. Due to the huge gap between the literature on the importance of translation and its practice on the ground , this article attempts to confirm the validity of this pedagogical tool and suggest some guidelines as to how and when to integrate translation activities within the teaching of English as a foreign language.  The data were collected through a questionnaire addressed to secondary school teachers working in different cities in Algeria. Though it has never been practised in a principled and purposeful way, translation, has gained a wide recognition from secondary school teachers who reported that this pedagogical tool played a considerable role in facilitating foreign language learning and improving language skills. The findings confirmed the effectiveness of translation in explaining new vocabulary, developing students’ cognitive skills and extending students’ background knowledge as well as their linguistic competence.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL|Grammar-Translation Method (GTM)|pedagogical translation|teachers’ attitudes and perceptions|translation,2018-07-02T11:10:45.807933,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:41:52.496017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/citation/,3gx4w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w9txe/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/relationships/node/,w9txe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab6ade594d9002527d7a3d/,59ab6ade594d9002527d7a3d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gx4w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3gx4w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3gx4w,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.11

The words are used and then expanded further in a way as if it has never been spoken before. It is the repetition or duplication of words; however; it has been argued that every repetition is not a tautology. Poets use this part of speech in their work for many years. Owing to its principal use in poems, it deserves an investigatory research work. This study aims at analyzing ‘tautologies’ in William Wordsworth’s poem “The Thorn” from the viewpoint of stylistic analysis. This analysis can show the significance of the use of tautological words to conclude whether tautologies produce redundancy or make a poem beautiful. Leech (1969) is the model adopted in analyzing the selected poem where the concept of “Foregrounding"" is introduced as being considered an important field of stylistic analysis. The analysis is quantitative where a statistical analysis is conducted. It is hypothesized that tautology is redundancy, whereas the findings reveal it as an expression of the depth of the human feelings. Wordsworth has successfully used tautology to achieve the themes included in his poem. This paper is hoped to help researchers know the position and effectiveness of tautology in literary texts, specifically, in poems.",TRUE,FALSE,Duplication|foregrounding|redundancy|repetition|stylistic analysis|tautology,2018-07-02T11:10:45.772836,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:36:05.563937,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/citation/,bjzmn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4nr3g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/relationships/node/,4nr3g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab69e3594d9002537d4607/,59ab69e3594d9002537d4607,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzmn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bjzmn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bjzmn,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.10

Taking the film Утомленные Солнцем (Burnt by the Sun) as a case study, the authors aim to describe translation strategies for transadapting cultural realia in their own Arabic dubbing script, and to look at them from the perspective of the translation norms that are operational in the Arab society. For the analysis of strategies of transadapting cultural realia into Arabic, the researchers use the taxonomy developed by Pedersen (Pedersen, 2005). They also employ the concept of norms by Toury (Toury, (1995/2012)) since these norms take into account cultural and social constraints of the community, which have an impact on the translator’s choices. The results of the study show that mostly source text-oriented strategies were used for transadapting the Soviet Russia cultural realia, with the exception of the realia belonging to the category of linguistic culture. It is true, however, that the norms operating in the Arab society and the constraints of the dubbing and subtitling modes can impact the translator’s choice to a large extent.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural realia|norms|Russian cinematography|Russian into Arabic dubbing|transadaptation,2018-07-02T11:10:45.739090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:31:36.713735,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/citation/,7sqvd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/reh3v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/relationships/node/,reh3v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab68bcb83f69025cb3e288/,59ab68bcb83f69025cb3e288,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7sqvd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7sqvd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7sqvd,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.9

The paper is divided into two parts. The first part is concerned with a brief view of the nature of formalism: its background and its process of analysis. The second part is devoted to putting into practice what has been dealt with in the first part. It will be mostly concerned with the question as to whether all the functions of dramatis personae as stated by Propp figure in the object of analysis, Great Expectations. Finally, the paper will draw the conclusion as to whether the aforementioned elements constitute an organic unity.",TRUE,FALSE,dramatis personae|folktale|formalistic reading|morphological substructure,2018-07-02T11:10:45.705834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:26:58.283378,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/citation/,h6mt2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jbgtz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/relationships/node/,jbgtz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab67cf6c613b02536a00e9/,59ab67cf6c613b02536a00e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6mt2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h6mt2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h6mt2,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.8
