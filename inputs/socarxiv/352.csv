A potential lever to reduce this disadvantage is to improve the health situation of lower socioeconomic groups. Our objective is to explore how the considerable within-US variation in health inequalities compares to the health inequalities across other Western countries. Methods: Representative survey data from 44 European countries and the US federal states were obtained from the fourth wave of the European Values Study (EVS) and the 2008 wave of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Using binary logistic regression, we analyze different forms of educational inequalities in self-rated health (SRH), adjusted for age and sex. Results: The extent of educational inequalities in SRH varies considerably over European countries and US states; with US states in general showing greater inequality, however, differences between US states and European countries are less clear than commonly assumed. Conclusions: The US has considerable differences in educational inequalities in SRH across geographic locations.

attempt to advance this goal by building popular support within the established
institutional framework. Some, however, seek to protect their tenure in office by
undermining institutions and disabling all opposition. The striking lesson of the
successful cases of backsliding is that governments need not take unconstitutional or
undemocratic steps to secure domination and yet the cumulative effect is that unless
citizens react early they may lose the ability to remove the incumbent government by
democratic means. We investigate what makes democracy vulnerable to such steps,
specifically, whether a government would take anti-democratic steps, whether it can
be stopped short of realization of complete domination, and whether it is likely to be
removed at any stage of the process",TRUE,FALSE,backsliding dynamic|democracy,2019-12-09T22:25:42.859057,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-09T22:25:32.889285,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Zhaotian Luo and Adam Przeworski,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/citation/,4yw98,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dee727c31d852000a062fc8/,5dee727c31d852000a062fc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yw98/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4yw98/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4yw98

Success in building and sustaining these “organized research units” and in reconciling their competing interests is central to the mission of a research university. In this preliminary study, we focus on individual experiences of working in cross-disciplinary research projects and centres within a large research university. Through interviewing key individuals (project leaders, academic and non-academic staff) engaged in running large research projects and/or centres, we aim to unpack the diversity and dynamics of different institutional logics at work at different stages of the organized research unit (ORU) life cycle. We seek to draw general conclusions in terms of managing and reconciling the research missions of ORUs, the university, and its external stakeholders (government, industry and society in general).

We used semi-structured interviews with 27 academic, management and professional staff at the University of Edinburgh to explore the life cycles of selected projects and centres from planning and preparation through to decommissioning. We observed the degree to which pursuit of challenge-led opportunities induced the emergence of new project-level organizational forms or changed academics’ modus operandi from “Mode 1” research to “Mode2” knowledge production.  We further explored the levels of management input and administrative support expected and received by the project organization from its host academic schools, colleges the university. We found that the size, complexity and disciplinary, interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary scope of the initiatives influenced their emergence as autonomous project organisations. “Role strain” affected many respondents as they sought to balance Mode 1 academic and Mode 2 leadership and management roles in their project organizations.  Further exploration of the distribution of leadership management and professional support functions among project organizations and the support structures of academic schools, colleges and the university is warranted.  We suggest that the university might usefully act as a boundary organization and adopt a Mode 2 knowledge exchange mission in support of multi-stakeholder projects.

However, within the archaeological discourse, the concept of health and healthcare has always conversed as disease evidence or injuries in palaeopathology or occasional description of surgical involvement (interface between survival need and disease) as a mechanism or skill of healing. Bio-anthropologist and archaeologist used to find out causal explanation for the reasons of death from the excavated skeleton by practising paleopathology (which includes palaeohistology. Paleoepidemiology, DNA analysis, and differential Analysis). But fails to create an informal space where biology unites with culture. This theoretical paper will critically examine the possibilities to highlight the diluted concept of health and healthcare in the archaeological debate of the organic evolution with the help of community-based archaeology along with the examination of material residue to remodel past health in present as a bio-cultural component.",TRUE,FALSE,Bio-cultural|Community-based archaeology|Health|Health Care,2019-12-08T16:30:41.945202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T16:30:32.647813,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/citation/,x7hqz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dece296eb3ee6000a8c2000/,5dece296eb3ee6000a8c2000,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x7hqz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x7hqz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x7hqz

1.	Individuals act and interact in variable ways from constantly shifting states-of-affairs in pursuit of variable and inconsistent interests;
2.	Groups are made-up of individuals and their actions/interactions;
3.	The vast majority of groups, current and historic, are stable.
Together, the above statements comprise one of the central, perennial problems of sociology; given that the three statements above are empirically verifiable and thus objectively true, we live in stable societies made up of mutually inconsistent, constantly fluctuating individual actions. But how can this be? How can the patterned regularity of social life be aggregated from the disorder and seeming randomness of individual actions? When modeled, sampled, and plotted, the data set of statement 1 should have wide fluctuation in its mean; indeed, rational choice models have shown this to be the case. However the data set for statement 3 should not, yet because 3 is derived from 1 (via the axiom held at statement 2), we are confronted with the above problem.
The answer lies in what I call the Predictability Hypothesis, consisting of two clauses: A) of the possible paths to achieving her desired goals, an individual will choose the most predictable path towards the most predictable desired goal; if the individual cannot sufficiently predict the behavior or attributes of their interest or the path that constitutes pursuit of its achievement, she is very unlikely to choose to pursue the interest or to follow that path to the interest, and will instead choose a path and/or interest with a higher predictability; B) for comparable societies, those that provide more choice to their members simultaneously provide more predictability and will, ceteris paribus, be more stable than those that provide less choice and, thus, less predictability.
I contend that this hypothesis allows the resolution of the above difficulty: the analytical centrality of (neo-Bayesian) predictability to every choice no matter the context bridges the explanatory gap between individual actions and the large-scale sociological phenomena of social stability; in the same way, the analytical centrality of stability to groups and group structures allows us to identify the predictable paths of agency. This analytical dualism is used to identify the mutual morphogenesis of both sociodynamic ‘poles’ in the example...individual and collective, ‘micro’ and ‘macro’, agent and structure-culture, in a way applicable to a wide range of rigorous sociological inquiry.",TRUE,FALSE,Bounded Rationality|Contract Theory|Decision Theory|Entrained Choice|Morphogenesis|Rational Choice|Social Stability|Social Trust|Sociodynamics|Sociological Constant|Uncertainty,2019-12-08T01:28:46.614719,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-08T01:28:27.481973,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/citation/,hyjd8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5deaca2331d852000903a6f5/,5deaca2331d852000903a6f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hyjd8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hyjd8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hyjd8
