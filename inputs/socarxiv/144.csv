Even localized crises such as Hurricane Katrina that lay bare existing inequalities in society seem to do little to nothing in moving public opinion on this matter. However, the coronavirus pandemic presents a new opportunity for social scientists and policy experts to test whether large-scale national crises can lead to changes in people’s opinions. What is the impact of a crisis of this proportion on Americans’ attitudes towards inequality? More specifically, is there an “added value” to being informed about class inequalities in the context of the coronavirus outbreak compared to being informed about such inequalities in general terms without reference to this extraordinary event? This study answers these questions using an online experiment that manipulates the information respondents receive prior to answering survey questions. I find that receiving information about class inequalities specifically in relation to the outbreak tends to be much more effective in moving people’s opinions compared to receiving that information in a way that does not directly relate it to coronavirus. This suggests that attitudes can be moved by something as widespread and salient as the pandemic.",TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus (COVID-19)|inequality|public opinion|redistribution|survey experiment,2020-07-29T21:45:41.149645,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-29T21:45:14.468979,FALSE,NA,no,"All code, materials, and de-identified data will be made public once the study is over.",,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/citation/,sm9q6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nxbwa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/relationships/node/,nxbwa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f20e5da32080501ef158a45/,5f20e5da32080501ef158a45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sm9q6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sm9q6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sm9q6,NA

Research shows that Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and poor communities are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards, have lower access to environmental amenities, and are materially harmed by these inequalities. Existing explanations of environmental inequality formation ignore the role of public opinion, consistent with broader theoretical turns in sociological theory. This omission exists even though there is substantial evidence that public beliefs about the distribution of resources is a crucial factor in the reproduction of inequality. Results of a novel national survey (n = 1000) show that Americans poorly understand environmental inequality, often view inequalities as fair, but are tentatively supportive of a range of key policy tools. Further analyses reveal that Americans understand environmental inequality through what I term color-blind environmental racism, or the use of color-blind racial ideology to justify environmental racism and oppose policy solutions. Broadly, this study demonstrates the importance of incorporating public opinion into theories of environmental inequality, demonstrates how belief in a post-racial society contributes to environmental inequality, and helps to explain the slow progress on this long-standing social problem.",TRUE,FALSE,environmental inequality|environmental justice|environmental sociology|public opinion,2020-07-29T21:46:42.377701,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-29T21:46:15.545026,FALSE,NA,no,Data and code are available upon request to the author,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/citation/,hg69c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2054be61875e01aa3170be/,5f2054be61875e01aa3170be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg69c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hg69c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hg69c,NA

It sheds light on the current dysfunctional system of resource allocation of the CAP and its poor economic, ecological and social outcomes. While the disparity between the desired outcomes and the reality is undisputed within research, former reforms have resulted in little change of the CAP. However, there is now a window of opportunity for real change with the transitional phase of the CAP, the shock event of the Coronavirus pandemic as a magnifying glass for underlying systemic problems and the proclamation of the European Green Deal, in particular the Farm-to-Fork-Strategy. The current system is impoverishing our biodiversity, soils, health and rural socio-economic tissue. To break this downward spiral, the authors suggest allocating resources according to the common good that a farm produces.

To do so, we randomly assigned survey respondents information about the candidates using vignettes that distill the dominant narratives (both pro- and con-) surrounding the candidate. We show that the vignettes tend to equalize favorability ratings across candidates, though in general the lesser-known candidates do not fully catch up to the more well-known candidates. In the control condition emulating standard polling methodologies, the candidates viewed most favorably are Warren and Harris, with 46/100 average favorability, followed by Abrams at 43, and the remainder at 42 or below. In the treatment condition where respondents have been exposed to information, the candidates viewed most favorably are Harris (46), Warren (45), and Bottoms (45), followed by Duckworth, Rice, and Abrams, all at 44.

The continued burden of psychosocial stressors in different contexts necessitates multipronged interventions that address mental health problems and associated disparities. Global evidence suggests that social capital plays a critical role in determining mental health outcomes in communities, which can be leveraged for improving mental health in COVID-19. As communities with better social capital is likely to have a lower burden of mental disorders, it is necessary to assess potential measures to use social capital for mental health promotion in vulnerable populations.

Just as biologists explain the origins and maintenance of trait differences among organisms using phylogenetic methods, so anthropologists studying cultural macroevolutionary processes use phylogenetic methods to uncover the history of human populations and the dynamics of culturally transmitted traits. In this paper we revisit concerns with the validity of these methods. Specifically, we use simulations to reveal how properties of the sample (size, missing data), properties of the tree (shape), and properties of the traits (rate of change, number of variants, transmission mode) might influence the inferences that can be drawn about trait distributions across a given phylogeny and the power to discern alternative histories. Our approach shows that in two example datasets specific combinations of properties of the sample, of the tree, and of the trait can lead to potentially high rates of Type I and Type II errors. We offer this simulation tool to help assess the potential impact of this list of persistent perils in future cultural macroevolutionary work.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|horizontal transmission|macroevolution|phylogeny|simulation,2020-07-28T14:51:41.756340,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-28T14:51:10.382770,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/dieterlukas/CulturalMacroevolution_Simulation,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/citation/,tjvgy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1ea08161875e00ed314859/,5f1ea08161875e00ed314859,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tjvgy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tjvgy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tjvgy,NA

•	Previously-low-crime rate areas experienced crime increases.

How University Rankings Matter,"University rankings have gained prominence in tandem with the global race towards excellence and as part of the growing expectation of rational, scientific evaluation of performance across a range of institutional sectors and human activity.  While their omnipresence is acknowledged, empirically we know less about whether and how rankings matter in higher education outcomes.  Do university rankings, predicated on universalistic standards and shared metrics of quality, function meritocratically to level the impact of long-established reputations?  We address this question by analyzing the extent to which changes in the position of UK universities in ranking tables, beyond existing reputations, impact on their strategic goal of international student recruitment.  We draw upon an ad hoc dataset merging aggregate (university) level indicators of ranking performance and reputation with indicators of other institutional characteristics and international student numbers. Our findings show that recruitment of international students is primarily determined by perceptions of university reputation, socially mediated and sedimented over the long term, rather than universities’ yearly updated ranking positions.  We conclude that while improving rankings does not necessarily change universities’ recruitment outcomes, they are nevertheless consequential for universities and students as strategic actors investing in rankings as purpose and identity.",TRUE,FALSE,higher education|institutional analysis|international students|reputational prestige|sociology of evaluation|university rankings,2020-07-28T07:04:24.260374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-28T07:04:02.388246,FALSE,NA,no,Available from the authors upon request.,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,Yasemin Nuhoglu Soysal|Roxana Baltaru|Hector Cebolla-Boado,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/citation/,f6by3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1dd7265fdf6200ce04c5e6/,5f1dd7265fdf6200ce04c5e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6by3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6by3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6by3,NA
