Existing accounts have focused on anti-immigration attitudes, anti-establishment sentiment and on the ‘left behind’, as well as on national identity. This paper expands the range of possible explanations for the vote by considering a wider range of identity measures, including class and racial identities, and by considering in detail the role played by connectedness to others and to localities. We find evidence that racial identity was particularly important for White British voters, extending our understanding of the relationship between territorial identities, ethnicity and attitudes towards the European Union. Connectedness via networks also structures attitudes, with those with higher levels of and more diverse connections having more favourable attitudes towards the EU. Whilst these effects are smaller than those of education and age, they are nonetheless comparable with those of class and income, and suggest that we should be wary of accounts of attitudes towards the EU that fail to locate voters within their social contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Brexit|Civic Engagement|Connectedness|Diversity|Ethnicity|EU Referendum 2016|European Union|Euroscepticism|National identity|Neighbourhood|Personality|Social Capital|Social Networks,2018-07-02T11:20:49.461804,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-06T09:58:12.747110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Siobhan McAndrew; Paula Surridge; Neema Begum,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/citation/,w95xa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wtvmg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/relationships/node/,wtvmg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ff90c79ad5a1027a3c8255/,59ff90c79ad5a1027a3c8255,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w95xa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w95xa/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w95xa

Since this time, RJ has experienced rapid growth in theory and practice. At the same time, much of this growth has come from expansion in lower-end criminal justice responses to crime, and in the increasing use of the term “restorative” for a widening host of practices and interventions. RJ has also faced problems related to its increasing institutionalization, resulting in divergence from earlier aims and goals. In this article, we set forth what we see as the four biggest challenges facing the future of RJ, namely problems related to definition, institutionalization, displacement, and relevance of RJ practices.

Qualitative data are commonly collected in higher, graduate, and post-graduate education; however, perhaps especially in the quantitative sciences, utilization of this qualitative data for decision-making can be challenging. A method for the analysis of qualitative data is the Degrees of Freedom Analysis, published in 1975. Given its origins in political science and its application in mainly business contexts, the degrees-of-freedom analysis method (DoFA) is unlikely to be discoverable or used to understand survey or other educational data obtained from teaching, training, or evaluation. This paper therefore introduces and demonstrates the DoFA with modifications specifically to support educational research and decision-making with examples in bioinformatics. DoFA identifies and aligns theoretical or applied principles with qualitative evidence. The demonstrations include two hypothetical examples, and a case study of the role of scaffolding in an independent project (“capstone”) of a graduate course in biostatistics. Included to promote inquiry, inquiry-based learning, and the development of research skills, the capstone is often scaffolded (instructor-supported and therefore, formative), although it is actually intended to be summative.

While the ideal of objectivity is key to American journalism and its development as a profession, recent scholarship and new media developments have challenged the dominance of objectivity as a professional norm. This article begins with the understanding that subjectivity is an intractable part of knowing (and reporting on) the world around us to build our understanding of different modes of subjectivity and how these animate journalistic practices. Taking arts reporting, specifically reviewing, as a case study, the analysis draws on interviews with 40 book reviewers who write for major American newspapers, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and prominent blogs. Findings reveal how emotions, bias, and self-interest are salient – sometimes as vice and sometimes as virtue – across the workflow of critics writing for traditional print outlets and book blogs and that these differences can be conceptualized as different epistemic styles.",TRUE,FALSE,bias|Blogs|books|critics|emotion|epistemology|journalism|newspapers|objectivity|online media|practice|reviews|subjectivity,2018-07-02T11:20:44.900344,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-03T12:10:42.088335,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/citation/,z6fht,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2kzdx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/relationships/node/,2kzdx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59fc5b1c9ad5a102665bd6cc/,59fc5b1c9ad5a102665bd6cc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z6fht/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z6fht/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884917722453,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z6fht

This paper focuses on several graphs that misrepresented or distorted scientific findings that were used in the campaign related to this panic and explores (1) how the graphs were made, used, and authorized, and (2) how they contributed to changes in discourses and policies. Findings are the following: (1) The graphs were made in the field of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive medicine by questionable methods, including falsifying, trimming, and misunderstanding of data. (2) Researchers in the field of fertility study relied on secondary and tertiary sources thus ignoring and compounding errors. (3) Such inauthentic research was approved and politically mobilized by professional organizations, rather than being penalized or criticized. (4) Discourse based on such unscientific knowledge may have encouraged a pronatalist policy of promoting early marriage and education about human fertility and life planning, targeted at teenage girls.",TRUE,FALSE,academic integrity|biology|education|fecundity|fertility|gender|Japan|medicine|population|pronatalist policy|pseudoscience|reproductive medicine|reproductive rights|research ethics,2018-07-02T11:20:44.814955,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-11-03T09:44:39.784403,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/citation/,uz4gd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5qshk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/relationships/node/,5qshk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59fc3919b83f69026c60f570/,59fc3919b83f69026c60f570,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uz4gd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uz4gd/,https://doi.org/10.1108/S1529-212620170000024006,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uz4gd
