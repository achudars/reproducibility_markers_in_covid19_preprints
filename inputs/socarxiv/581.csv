In the following, we describe the social regularities that underlie and the conditions that embed these high achievements in computer science innovation. We find, contrary to a meritocratic ideal of one's only abilities determining success or recognition within sciences, that several characteristics of scientists, exogenous and non-exogenous alike to their scientific work and identities, are of overbearing or disproportionate importance in defining academic acknowledgement. We find in particular that nationality or birth place, gender and one's network have a big role in making Turing Award laureates. As do social origins, with a significant portion of Turing Award winners coming primarily from middle- and upper-class family backgrounds, especially households with significant cultural capital i.e. one or both parents hold an advanced degree or are engaged in an academic profession). Reviewing the data before us, we were also unable to ignore the non-participation of visible minorities and non-white computer scientists to the body of Turing Award recipients. In short, place of birth, nationality, gender, social background, ""race"" and networks play a role in making Turing Award laureates.

Practice-based teacher educators use various approaches to simulation in methods courses, and these simulations often attempt to holistically replicate the complexity of teaching conditions. In this research, we present a range of practice spaces that don’t attempt to replicate teaching, but explore design spaces with varying levels of authenticity. We define four dimensions of authenticity in teaching simulations: authenticity of complexity, of situation, of role, and of task. We discuss how these different dimensions of authenticity intersect with playfulness in the examination of five case studies of teacher practice spaces. We hypothesize that authenticity of task is essential to most teacher practice spaces, but interesting new design spaces can be found by moving away from other dimensions of authenticity.",TRUE,FALSE,#authenticity|#design spaces|#practice spaces|#simulation|#teacher,2018-07-02T11:55:48.995211,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-13T13:31:18.526204,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/citation/,pqmgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eg6a8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/relationships/node/,eg6a8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b200c62ba5d13000f08af78/,5b200c62ba5d13000f08af78,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqmgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pqmgs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pqmgs,NA

Certain theories of political socialization hold that cohorts reaching political maturity under dictatorship are subject to apathy. Yet, it remains unclear whether mobilization during the transition can counterbalance this effect. This article examines the protest behavior of citizens socialized in Eastern Germany, a region marked by two legacies: a legacy of autocracy and, following the 1989-90 revolution, a legacy of transitional mobilization. Using age-period-cohort models with data from the European Social Survey, the analysis assesses the evolution of gaps in protest across generations and time between East and West Germans. The results demonstrate that participation in demonstrations, petitions, and boycotts is lower for East Germans socialized under communism in comparison with West Germans from the same cohorts. This participation deficit remains stable over time and even increases for certain protest activities.",TRUE,FALSE,age-period-cohort analysis|democratization|Eastern Germany|political participation|political socialization,2018-07-02T11:55:48.704629,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-12T17:47:35.021076,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/citation/,gj53p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x8df6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/relationships/node/,x8df6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1fc998ba5d130010084a20/,5b1fc998ba5d130010084a20,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gj53p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gj53p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gj53p,https://doi.org/10.1163/15691330-12341481

We chose the discipline of Bibliometrics / Scientometrics as a case study. After carrying out a series of keywords searches in Google Scholar Citations (GSC) and Google Scholar (GS), 813 relevant researchers were identified. Researchers were further classified as core (those who work mainly on Scientometrics) or related (those who work in other disciplines, with occasional incursions into Scientometrics). Additional information about these researchers was collected from other platforms (ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley, and Twitter). Up to 28 author-level indicators were collected about each researcher, as well as data about up to 100 of the most cited documents displayed in their GSC profile. The document-level data from all GSC profiles, as well as the data extracted from the keyword searchers in GS, was aggregated to create a list of the top 1000 most cited documents in the discipline. This document collection was further processed to generate a list of the most influential journals and publishers in the discipline.

Much less is known however about the sources of people’s different beliefs. I argue that scholarship is hampered by a lack of consensus regarding the conceptualization and measurement of inequality beliefs, in the absence of an organizing theory. To fill this gap, in this paper I develop a framework for studying the social basis of people's explanations for inequality. I propose that people observe unequal outcomes and must infer the invisible forces that brought these about, be they meritocratic or structural in nature. In making inferences about the causes of inequality, people draw on lessons from past experience and information about the world, both of which are biased and limited by their background, social networks, and the environments they have been exposed to. Looking at inequality beliefs through this lens allows for an investigation into the kinds of experiences and environments that are particularly salient in shaping people’s inferential accounts of inequality.

Abstract
This essay is about constructive ways for responding to criticism about how your style as a person of power or privilege may be hurting others in your teaching or advising. Along the way it addresses the broader problems of taking criticism in general and of cultural differences in interaction styles. The punchline is about trying to be who you are (no personality transplants) in a way that respects both yourself and others and helps make your environment feel inclusive for more marginalized people. Sections discuss five issues: (1) Pay attention to issues of power and privilege. (2) Let people know you are open to criticism, including suggestions for classroom strategies. (3) Respect cultural and personal differences in interaction style and look for ways to communicate across these differences with attention to have this interacts with issues of power and privilege. (4) Learn general principles of taking criticism, including staying calm, listening for understanding, asking for time to think and reflect on critiques. (5) Pay attention to the problem of destructive criticism, including destructive relationships and bad classroom dynamics. The conclusion emphasizes that including formerly marginalized groups inevitably produces cultural conflict. Openness to criticism is a way forward for bridging differences in cultural and personal styles.",TRUE,FALSE,criticism|cultural difference|cultural styles|diversity|inclusion|personal styles|teaching,2018-07-02T11:55:47.077310,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-10T19:59:40.781064,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/citation/,gvcmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mshpv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/relationships/node/,mshpv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1d36bfec24e20011b70b56/,5b1d36bfec24e20011b70b56,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvcmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvcmk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvcmk,NA
