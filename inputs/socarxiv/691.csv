Yet despite major shifts in both medical education and in medicine writ-large, medical sociologists' focus on emotions has largely disappeared. In this paper, we argue that due to recent radical transformations in the medical arena, emotional socialization within medical education should be of renewed interest for sociologists. Developments in medical education such as increased diversity among enrollees, the rise of patient health movements, and curricular transformation have made this context a particularly interesting case for sociologists working on a variety of questions related to structural, organizational, and cultural change. We offer three areas of debate within studies in medical education that sociologists may be interested in studying: 1) gendered and racialized differences in the performance of clinical skills related to emotion, 2) differences in self-reported empathy among subspecialties, and 3) loss of empathy during the third year or clinical year of medical school.",TRUE,FALSE,Biomedicine|Emotion|Emotional Socialization|Medical education|Professional socialization,2018-07-02T11:03:29.388556,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-15T00:08:07.577753,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/citation/,3wcr2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/69hnw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/relationships/node/,69hnw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59695bc0594d90022bee067a/,59695bc0594d90022bee067a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3wcr2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3wcr2/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.05.027,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3wcr2

Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture. We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers.

Legal scholars have long recognized the influence of the New York lawyer David Dudley Field on American legal codification, but tracing the influence of Field’s code of civil procedure with precision across some 30,000 pages of statutes is a daunting task. By adapting methods of digital text analysis to observe text reuse in legal sources, this article provides a methodological guide to show how the evolution of law can be studied at a macro level—across many codes and jurisdictions—and at a micro level—regulation by regulation. Applying these techniques to the Field Code and its emulators, we show that by a combination of creditors’ remedies the code exchanged the rhythms of agriculture for those of merchant capitalism. Archival research confirmed that the spread of the Field Code united the American South and American West in one Greater Reconstruction. Instead of just a national political development centered in Washington, we show that Reconstruction was also a state-level legal development centered on a procedure code from the Empire State of finance capitalism.",TRUE,FALSE,codes of civil procedure|digital history|federalism|history of capitalism|legal history|text analysis,2018-07-02T11:03:28.358022,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-12T20:53:21.366861,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c72|Law|Civil Procedure|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cce|Arts and Humanities|History|United States History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdf|Arts and Humanities|History|Legal,Kellen Funk and Lincoln Mullen,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/citation/,w8un4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xup2h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/relationships/node/,xup2h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596688e26c613b00446ff69e/,596688e26c613b00446ff69e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w8un4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8un4/,https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/123.1.132,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8un4

Digital humanitarianism melds together these new technologies with new institutional practices and relationships, drawing on the labor and knowledge of laypeople from across the world. This reconfiguration of data, labor, and technology raises pressing new questions for scholars interested in social and political implications of spatial technologies. Although digital humanitarianism explicitly uses spatial technologies to bridge disparate geographies, to date, very little work has clarified the theoretical frameworks from which geographers can draw to position it in relation to GIScience and the geoweb. In this chapter I argue that geographers are uniquely well-positioned to contribute theoretical insights into digital humanitarianism. I identify three theoretical frameworks that geographers can engage in order to draw resonances and linkages between digital humanitarianism and broader debates in GIScience and the geoweb. Specifically, first I show that particular attention should be paid to the spatialities of digital humanitarianism - who produces what kinds of data in what kinds of places? Second, I argue that the use of Big Data in digital humanitarianism reconfigures relations between humanitarianism and the private, for-profit sector. This goes hand-in-hand with the reconceptualization of data as aid in crisis zones. Third, I suggest insights from spatial technology research can illuminate the new struggles over knowledge collection and representation in digital humanitarian systems.

Recent research on religion and breastfeeding from a low-income, urban sample in the United States found that religious affiliation and religious attendance were associated with breastfeeding initiation.
Purpose
We assessed the relationship between religion (religious affiliation and religious attendance) and breastfeeding (initiation and duration) in a nationally representative prospective cohort study. We examined whether education and other sociodemographic characteristics mediated or moderated relationships.
Methods
Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (n = 3,719), we regressed breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding duration for first births on religious affiliation and religious attendance, comparing conservative Protestants to other religious groups. Sociodemographic characteristics were explored as potential mediators or moderators of relationships. 
Results
Other than Black Protestants, all religious groups reported higher odds of breastfeeding initiation compared to conservative Protestants (odds ratios = 1.43–3.01; all P &lt; .01). All groups also breastfed longer than conservative Protestants, with the exception of Black Protestants and Catholics. Educational attainment explained breastfeeding initiation differences with the exception of nonaffiliates and “other” religious affiliates. Educational attainment also explained religious group breastfeeding duration differences with the exception of nonaffiliates. In our final models, regular religious attendance was not directly associated with breastfeeding, but it magnified the breastfeeding duration advantage seen among mothers who had a later age at first birth.
Conclusions
The role of educational attainment in explaining breastfeeding differences between conservative Protestants and other groups suggests educational interventions may be beneficial within this population.",TRUE,FALSE,age|breastfeeding|breastfeeding duration|breastfeeding initiation|conservative Protestantism|education|evangelicalism|health|public health|religion|sociology of religion,2018-07-02T11:03:28.095629,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-11T13:13:51.698907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb2|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Other Religion|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb9|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Christian Denominations and Sects|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/citation/,swdce,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xyk8u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/relationships/node/,xyk8u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5964cd68594d900229a73b4c/,5964cd68594d900229a73b4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swdce/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/swdce/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/swdce

Despite the fact some items of construction waste are considered inert for the environment (soil, concrete) it also contains hazardous items (paint additives, cans, and containers) or recyclables (plastics, metals, wood). Potential recovery of this waste stream is high if it is properly managed. The paper estimates the potential amounts of waste resulted from residential constructions across rural municipalities of Neamț County between 2002 and 2010. These statistical values are calculated at commune level (rural territorial administrative unit) in order to outline the disparities between various geographical areas using thematic cartography. This approach is correlated with demographic features in order to reflect such spatial patterns.

Yet while each has held free and fair elections, they have varied in the extent to which their citizens realize the ideal of self-rule. Why do some democracies distribute power to citizens while other democracies withhold it? Existing research is suggestive, but its implications are ambiguous. Cross-national studies have focused on democracy’s formal dimensions, while work on substantive democracy is case-based. We find that one of the most consistent and powerful explanations of substantive democratization is the length of unarmed pro-democratic mobilization prior to a transition. Through a case study of Brazil, we illustrate that these movements matter in three ways: first, because practices of self-organizing model and enable democratic reforms; second, because movement veterans use state office to deepen democracy; and third, because long movements yield  civil societies with the capacity to demand the continuous deepening of democracy.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazil|contentious politics|democracy|democratic deepening|democratization|mobilization|Participation|social inequality|social movements,2018-07-02T11:03:27.699250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-07-10T14:44:44.909823,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e27|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Ethnomethodology and Conservation Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|History of Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/citation/,4r8d6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fsna7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/relationships/node/,fsna7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596391c5b83f69022ad2ac82/,596391c5b83f69022ad2ac82,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4r8d6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4r8d6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4r8d6

An analysis of 346 British local authorities between 2009 and 2014,"Imposing financial penalties on claimants of unemployment insurance may incentivise labour market re-entry. However, sanctions may have differential effects depending on the work-readiness of the claimants. Here, I explore whether sanctioning disabled claimants is associated with greater labour market activity or inactivity among disabled people using data on 346 British local authorities between 2009 and 2014. When the number of sanctioned disabled claimants rises (as a proportion of all claimants) the proportion of economically inactive people who are also disabled becomes larger.
