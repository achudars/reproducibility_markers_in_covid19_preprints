‘stylized facts.’ Our focus is on the relationship between stylized 
facts and experimentation. Given the continued increase in 
experimentation across the social sciences, we think that it is 
important to consider the exact role that experiments play in the 
production and testing of stylized facts. We make three related 
contributions here. First, we describe how experiments can both provide 
new evidence to support existing stylized facts as well as produce new 
stylized facts. Second, we argue that the stylized facts produced 
through experimentation differ from other stylized facts. Third, we

This article examines popularity, reputation, and social influence on Twitter using large-scale digital traces from 2009 to 2016. We process network information on more than 40 million users, calculating new global measures of reputation that build on the D-core decomposition and the bow-tie structure of the Twitter follower network. We integrate our measurements of popularity, reputation, and social influence to evaluate what keeps users active, what makes them more popular, and what determines their influence. We find that there is a range of values in which the risk of a user becoming inactive grows with popularity and reputation. Popularity in Twitter resembles a proportional growth process that is faster in its strongly connected component, and that can be accelerated by reputation when users are already popular. We find that social influence on Twitter is mainly related to popularity rather than reputation, but that this growth of influence with popularity is sublinear. The explanatory and predictive power of our method shows that global network metrics are better predictors of inactivity and social influence, calling for analyses that go beyond local metrics like the number of followers.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:34.055242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-13T16:25:12.378000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/citation/,9ve3x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cb73d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/relationships/node/,cb73d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d8286a594d9001ea7cd8a1/,57d8286a594d9001ea7cd8a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ve3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ve3x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ve3x,https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.151

ABSTRACT: By 2016, ongoing police shootings of unarmed black men had increased public awareness of policing processes; chief among those was militarization. Prior researchers explored this relatively new process, but very few had systematically analyzed it. In this paper, I conceptualize, operationalize, and describe police militarization across the United States. I transformed publicly available data, the Law Enforcement and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) dataset, into a panel of over 4,000 police departments over an eighteen-year period. I then constructed an index based on each of three dimensions of militarization: (1) increased stock of military equipment; (2) increased usage of paramilitary tactics; and (3) increased focus on military-style policing. I explain the indicators within each sub dimension, and describe their unique trend across time. Using both this Absolute LEMAS Militarization Index (ALMI) and a summary analysis of each indicator, I describe militarization between 1990 and 2007 using hierarchical linear modeling. Among key findings are three trends. First, I provide nationally representative evidence of an increasing trend in police militarization across most departments, despite statistical controls. I also found that larger departments were both more militarized and militarized faster over time than smaller departments. Finally, I found that diverse departments (either proportionately more women or more black officers) militarized at a slower rate over the period. This paper provides the theoretical and methodological basis for follow-up analyses of processes affecting militarization, including variations in crime control, organizational characteristics and racial dynamics.",TRUE,FALSE,Criminal Justice|Criminology|Hierarchical Linear Modeling|Law Enforcement|Militarization|Panel Dataset|Police|Policing|Preprint|socarxiv|United States of America,2018-07-02T10:51:11.238313,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-09T17:52:38.155000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/citation/,m7j3v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/586j3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/relationships/node/,586j3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d2f2a9594d9001fee9da9f/,57d2f2a9594d9001fee9da9f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m7j3v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m7j3v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m7j3v,NA

top-management-team (TMT) characteristics, less is known about the 
effects of TMT structures, meaning the array of functional positions 
that TMT members fill.There are strong norms about TMT structures, so 
organizations that violate these norms may suffer.This is especially 
true for startups, which rely on their TMTs for legitimacy.Although many 
new organizations adopt TMT structures that are typical in their 
industry, others adopt more unusual structures.To study the effects of 
TMT structure unusualness, we build on theories of TMTs, legitimacy, and 
imprinting.We argue that organizations with more unusual TMT structures 
at startup suffer an /unusualness penalty/ and are more likely to fail, 
and that this unusualness penalty is stronger for specialists than 
generalists.We also argue that even if organizations amass experience 
with unusual TMT structures or their structures become less unusual, the 
unusualness penalty persists.To test these predictions, we analyze data 
on firms in one industry over five decades.The results generally support 
our predictions, indicating that unusual TMT structures have negative 
consequences that organizations cannot easily overcome.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:12.462026,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-08T19:05:58.430000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/citation/,ua2t5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7vmyn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/relationships/node/,7vmyn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d1b6986c613b01e43445c8/,57d1b6986c613b01e43445c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2t5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ua2t5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ua2t5,NA

with graduate training and research presences in fields outside the law 
– primarily in the social sciences, statistics, and the humanities, but 
also in biology and medicine – which has brought “interdisciplinarity” 
into law schools, in the form of scholarship under the banners of “law 
and [ ]” or “critical [ ] studies.” As their names suggest, these lines 
of inquiry either seek to extend traditional legal scholarship with 
complementary insights from external disciplines or else seek to 
question (if not overturn) traditional legal scholarship based on such 
insights. The rise of interdisciplinarity has been discussed in depth, 
with some scholars arguing that the rise of interdisciplinarity has 
strengthened the legal academy by broadening legal curricula and legal 
scholarship beyond traditional disciplinary law, while others aver that 
the rise of interdisciplinarity has reduced the autonomy of law in the 
university by introducing “alien” ideologies and practices. To trace 
this phenomenon, we use data-science methods to gather and analyze “big 
data” on the educational backgrounds of all faculty who held tenured and 
tenure-track positions in all accredited law schools in the United 
States in the 2011-12 academic year. Our analysis reveals a persistent 
increase in law-school faculty with PhDs, but most of those are faculty 
with both PhDs and JDs. This suggests that law schools have not been 
invaded by PhD-toting “pod people” importing alien values and practices 
from the arts and sciences Rather than reducing the autonomy of the law, 
the influx of PhD-trained faculty is more likely to be promoting an 
intellectual culture and academic practices that are a hybrid of the 
traditional legal academy and the arts and sciences, which involves 
taking only selected external elements and adapting them to fit 
traditional law-school culture and practices, rather than adopting them 
wholesale to replace traditional law-school culture and practices. Such 
hybridization would yield more of (almost) the same culture and 
practices. Our analysis also reveals that although PhD-trained faculty 
are concentrated in the most prestigious law schools, the influx of 
PhD-trained faculty has trickled down the ranks to many less prestigious 
schools. This suggests that PhD credentials have become an important 
axis of competition in the law school market, in which prospective law 
professors increasingly accumulate advanced degrees to compete for 
law-school positions, and law schools increasingly hire candidates with 
multiple advanced degrees to compete in prestige and media rankings. 
Finally, our analysis shows that male law professors are far more likely 
than their female counterparts to hold PhDs, but male professors are 
also far more likely than their female counterparts to be employed by 
top-tier law schools when they do not hold PhDs. The gender gap in the 
stratification of law faculty across the law-school prestige hierarchy 
indicates that even though the training of legal academics has changed, 
patterns of inequality in achievement have persisted.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:02.270720,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-08T19:04:46.388000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/citation/,y2zsk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n5mye/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/relationships/node/,n5mye,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d1b6509ad5a101e7eca5bf/,57d1b6509ad5a101e7eca5bf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y2zsk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y2zsk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y2zsk,NA

Although there were scattered mentions of this concept before 1990, this literature really began with the 1991 publication of a theory piece by Roger Friedland and Robert Alford.  Over the past twenty years, it has become a large and diverse area of organizational research.  Several books and thousands of papers and book chapters have been published on this topic, addressing institutional logics in sites as different as climate change proceedings of the United Nations, local banks in the United States, and business groups in Taiwan.  Next, we review this literature, beginning with a detailed explanation of the concept and the theory surrounding it.  To show how this literature developed over time within the broader framework of theory and empirical work in sociology, political science, and anthropology, we evaluate several intellectual precursors to institutional logics.  We then sample papers published in ten major sociology and management journals in the United States and Europe between 1990 and 2015, and analyze this sample of papers to identify trends in theoretical development and empirical findings.  After we detail these trends, we conclude by suggesting three gentle corrections and potentially useful extensions to this literature to guide future research:  (1) limiting the definition of institutional logic to cultural-cognitive phenomena, rather than including material phenomena; (2) recognizing both “cold” (purely rational) cognition and “hot” (emotion-laden) cognition; and (3) developing and testing a theory (or multiple related theories), meaning a logically interconnected set of propositions concerning a delimited set of social phenomena, derived from assumptions about essential facts (axioms), that details causal mechanisms and yields empirically testable (falsifiable) hypotheses, by being more consistent about how we use concepts in theoretical statements; assessing the reliability and validity of our empirical measures; and conducting meta-analyses of the many inductive studies that have been published, to develop deductive theories.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:13.183782,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-08T19:01:53.283000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/citation/,3pv2k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yca2v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/relationships/node/,yca2v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57d1b5a29ad5a101edeca4d6/,57d1b5a29ad5a101edeca4d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pv2k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pv2k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pv2k,NA

The results are consistent with the “weathering” hypothesis, which suggests that White women benefit from delayed childbearing while for Black women early childbearing is adaptive because of deteriorating health status through the childbearing years. For White women,the risk (adjusted for covariates) of infant death is U-shaped—lowest in the early thirties—while for Black women the risk increases linearly with age. Mexican-origin women show a J-shape, with highest risk at the oldest ages. The results underscore the need for understanding the relationship between maternal age and infant mortality in the context of unequal health experiences across race/ethnic groups in the US.",TRUE,FALSE,African American|demography|health disparities|Hispanic|infant mortality|maternal age|Preprint|race|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:50.104530,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-09-07T21:33:37.384000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/citation/,qesbg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9pehq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/relationships/node/,9pehq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57541f8c594d900214a42773/,57541f8c594d900214a42773,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qesbg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qesbg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qesbg,https://doi.org/10.15195/v3.a2
