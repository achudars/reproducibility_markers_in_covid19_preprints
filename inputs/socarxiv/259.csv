The main objective is to deepen the discussion on the concept of social costs in Kapp (Frigato, 2006), and its relationship with public health, also reflecting on the role of the State in the implementation of Public Health Policies. 
Methods: we follow the guidelines of Meneghetti (2011), understanding that in the essay, the object is studied in its dialectical condition, not necessarily requiring empirical proof. It starts from the guiding questions for theoretical argumentation, seeking to understand the object through associations or analogies, without the formalism of traditional scientific technique. 
Results: we can see that the Kappian perspective on social costs, expands its reach to the political level, and the concept can serve as a basis for the analysis of public policies. In particular, on public health, this concept contributes to the reflection of the role of the State, in social protection and in its permanent relationship with the market. 
Conclusion: the Kappian perspective perceives the circularity and interdependence in the relationship between health and the costs of capitalism, favours new insights and a critical reading of the associated institutional political phenomena, power games and conflicts around the public-private relationship in health.",TRUE,FALSE,Kapp|public health|public policies|social costs,2020-01-31T08:35:22.242854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-31T08:35:09.566164,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/citation/,wcxm8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e32bbfd4b201000642103f3/,5e32bbfd4b201000642103f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcxm8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wcxm8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wcxm8,NA

Findings show that a human-like chatbot leads to more information disclosure, and recommendation adherence mediated by higher perceived anthropomorphism and subsequently, lower privacy concerns in comparison to a machine-like chatbot.

However, online social network data often lacks basic demographic information about the nodes. Researchers must rely on predicted node attributes to estimate measures of homophily, but little is known about the validity of these measures. We show that estimating homophily in a network can be viewed as a dyadic prediction problem, and that homophily estimates are unbiased when dyad-level residuals sum to zero in the network. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of names to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally have this property and can introduce large biases into homophily estimates. Bias occurs due to error autocorrelation along dyads. Importantly, node-level classification performance is not a reliable indicator of estimation accuracy for homophily. We compare estimation strategies that make predictions at the node and dyad levels, evaluating performance in different settings. We propose a novel “ego-alter” modeling approach that outperforms standard node and dyad classification strategies. While this paper focuses on homophily, results generalize to other relational measures which aggregate predictions along the dyads in a network. We conclude with suggestions for research designs to study homophily in online networks.

This becomes especially true as activists attempt to draw connections between varied aims such as opposition to globalization and support for immigrants. During the 1999 Battle of Seattle, the movement focused on opposing neoliberalism (Graeber 2002) and advocating for alternative visions of globalization (Reitan 2012).  Some activists also noted the hypocrisy of opening borders to capital while militarizing the borders for migrants. Yet, in the end, immigrant rights movements and their central issues did not feature prominently in Seattle or later anti-globalization efforts. Simultaneously, however, most immigrant rights advocates have not prioritized opposition to the destructive power of global capitalism.

Considering racial disparities in lead-poisoning in the US and HIV-transmission in southern Africa, we show the solution is doomed. Politically-charged beliefs about societies and groups are integral to, and ineliminable from, assessments of public-health research. Because politically-charged beliefs inform those assessments, the assessments’ truth affects the research’s accuracy. However, research shows that sciences' sociopolitical uses subject politically-charged beliefs to systematic distortion. Since resultant errors are incorporated into our scientific corpus and inform assessments of new hypotheses, scientists need accurate sociopolitical theories of those distorting forces to identify likely errors. Analyzing Black-Panther opposition to violence research, we argue that since our society is structured by racial disparities and science has been distorted to buttress racial inequities, knowledgeable anti-racist scientists are disposed to exert a corrective force on public-health research. They hold accurate politically-charged beliefs about the sociopolitical forces shaping both science and health, and they are committed to eradicating distorting forces.

Our data cover seven generations and allows us to follow ancestors of individuals living in Sweden around the new millennium back more than 200 years, covering the mid-18th century to the 21st century. In our sample of around 75,000 traceable descendants, we analyze (a) up to 5th cousin correlations and (b) dynastic correlations over seven generations based on aggregations of ancestors’ social class/status. With both approaches, we find that past generations structure life chances many generations later, even though mobility is very high. The persistence we find using cousin and dynastic correlations is much higher compared to a simple Markov model limited to sequential parent–child transfers, but we also find that direct ancestor associations are very small. This suggests that there is a weak but constant kinship influence that attenuates slowly over generations. Importantly, cousin correlations are much stronger if the ancestor held a high class position, suggesting that closure is more accentuated in top of society.",TRUE,FALSE,cousin correlations|dynastic correlations|mobility|multigenerational|persistence|Sweden,2020-01-29T14:04:03.666235,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-29T14:03:38.563959,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/citation/,yjksz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e318c07af759300f9bdd098/,5e318c07af759300f9bdd098,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yjksz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yjksz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yjksz,NA
