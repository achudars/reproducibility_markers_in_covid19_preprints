In this paper I seek to contribute to this developing line of thinking on the culture-networks link as it pertains to the sociology of taste. I present a general analytic and measurement framework useful for rethinking traditional survey (or population) based data on individuals and their cultural choices as a “two mode” persons X genres network. The proposed methodological tools allow me to develop a set of “reflective” metrics useful for ranking both persons and genres in terms of the pattern of choices and audience composition embedded in the cultural network. The empirical analysis shows that these metrics have both face and criterion validity, allowing us to extract useful information that would remain out of reach of standard quantitative strategies.

This frequent geographical disruption directly affects the career trajectories of military spouses. Previous research established military spouses experience worse employment outcomes than their civilian peers, but less is known about the specific characteristics that lead to this difference. Do military spouses have worse employment outcomes because of being a tied migrant, or is there a separate effect because of their status as a military spouse? 

This article analyzes original data from a factorial vignette survey in which respondents evaluated fictitious job applicant profiles. Results suggest (1) Military spouses receive a premium as job applicants, they are evaluated as more warm, competent, reliable, and social, but receive lower evaluations on perceived longevity; (2) Military spouses with a stable geographic history are evaluated higher than civilians, but that premium switches to a penalty for military spouses with a history of moving frequently, in which case they are evaluated more harshly than civilians who have moved frequently; and (3) Neither tied migration nor military spouse status influence starting salary offers. As many careers require employees to move as part of their training or to seek advancement opportunities, understanding the employment-related challenges and opportunities military spouses face can lead to implications that may affect other tied migrants.",TRUE,FALSE,employment|military|military spouse|tied migration|work,2018-07-02T10:58:06.627638,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-12T16:53:02.574774,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/citation/,j5xn9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xu6dy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/relationships/node/,xu6dy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5915e8066c613b024cf7198a/,5915e8066c613b024cf7198a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j5xn9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j5xn9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j5xn9,NA

A key challenge for social ventures is resource acquisition. However, how social entrepreneurs gather the resources necessary to grow their organizations is not clear. The focus of this study is how narratives are used to acquire social venture resources. This topic is examined using a multi-study, inductive, theory-building design based on 121 interviews, observation, and archival data. In Study 1, I interview 75 entrepreneurs, investors, and ancillary participants in the social enterprise sector. In Study 2, I construct case studies of eight technology-focused social ventures. Evidence from this study is used to construct a framework explaining how differences in entrepreneurs’ narrative tactics and characteristics are associated with differences in their resource acquisition success. Specifically, from Study 1 I develop a typology of social enterprise narratives, identify three narrative-types (personal, social-good, and business), and show that they possess unique elements. Evidence from Study 2 suggests that the three narrative-types serve as the building blocks for communication with external stakeholders. These findings contribute to three literatures that formed the basis of the study – social entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial resource acquisition, and organizational narrative theory – and have implications for work on competing organizational logics.

This paper examines the types of stigmatizing language and frames present in news reports about persons with mental illness killed by police. A sample of 301 online news reports was content analyzed, of which 132 reports contributed to 231 examples of stigmatizing language or frames. Analysis indicates that the construction of stigma in these news reports does not fully adhere to existing frameworks for identifying stigmatization. Stigmatization that is implicit, and often seemingly innocuous, is almost three times as common in the analyzed news reports than overt and explicit forms of stigmatization. A modified framework for identifying stigmatization is proposed that includes the presence of stigmatizing syntax, implicit stereotypes, stigmatizing myths, and behavior labeling. To the author's knowledge, this study is the first to examine media stigmatization of persons with mental illness killed by police as well as explore stigmatization regarding suicide by cop. Implications of the findings for efforts to destigmatize mental illness are explored.

In this paper, we chart the smart city ecosystem in Dublin, Ireland, and examine how the four city authorities have actively collaborated to progressively frame and mobilise an articulated vision of Dublin as a smart city. In particular, we focus on the work of ‘Smart Dublin’, a shared unit established to coordinate, manage and promote Dublin’s smart city initiatives. We argue that Smart Dublin has on the one hand sought to corral smart city initiatives within a common framework, and on the other has acted to boost the city-region’s smart city activities, especially with respect to economic development. Our analysis highlights the value of undertaking a holistic mapping of a smart city in formation, and the role of political and administrative geographies and specialist smart city units in shaping that formation.",TRUE,FALSE,governance|procurement by challenge|SBIR|scaling|smart city|Smart Dublin|strategy|test-bedding,2018-07-02T10:56:50.329078,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-09T11:32:19.324386,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/citation/,93ga5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nm5ry/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/relationships/node/,nm5ry,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5911a5d26c613b0259aa7019/,5911a5d26c613b0259aa7019,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93ga5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93ga5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93ga5,NA

Participants: A random sample of 991 university students aged 18-24, enrolled at a major public university, participated in this study in February 2009. Methods: Students took a survey designed by researchers in college health promotion and sexual health. Survey responses were examined for differences in STI knowledge accuracy, and demographic and behavioral predispositions to getting an STI or HIV test. Results: STI knowledge and testing service use differed significantly by gender, race, sexual orientation, STI/HIV testing history, and being sexually active in the past year.
