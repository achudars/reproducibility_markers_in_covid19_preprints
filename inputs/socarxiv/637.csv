The traditional English teaching method cannot produce fluent English speakers. English teaching methodologies, such as English-only and Communicative Language Teaching (CLT), have been widely adopted as practical and the best way to acquire English speaking proficiency in children English language schools, to the point where they are taken for granted by many Taiwanese people. The central argument of this study is that the evaluation of the so-called the-best-English-teaching-method in children English language schools and as common practice in Taiwanese society is ideological. To explore the ideological concept of the-best-English-teaching-method used in children English language schools, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was employed to analyze data drawn from children English language schools’ promotional materials or advertisements. The results indicate the promotion of the-best-English-teaching-method by children English language schools has resulted in social injustice, such as native speaker ideology, native and non-native division, white and non-white division, and English proficiency gap in the rich and the poor and urban and rural areas.

It argues that the mismatch in Case value between the two nominal constituents – the DP “subject” and the DP or AP predicate - of verbless copular clauses is incompatible with the claim that a single probe can simultaneously agree with more than one goal. Rather, the Case phenomenon within the copular contexts considered appears to be consistent with, and follows from, an Agree relation between a single active probe and a single active matching goal.  Some SA copular clauses which include a modal-like negative element - laysa - will also be used to address the key issue under investigation.",TRUE,FALSE,agree|ⱷ-features|goal|multiple agree|probe,2018-07-02T11:31:08.663039,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-29T05:10:41.944798,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/citation/,yufka,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3awrj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/relationships/node/,3awrj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a45795f67d19e000f6a3616/,5a45795f67d19e000f6a3616,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yufka/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yufka/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no4.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yufka

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and longitudinal multilevel dyad models, this study investigated how educational assortative mating shaped income dynamics in couples over the marital life course. Based on educational assortative mating, couples were grouped into three categories—educational hypergamy (wives less educated than their husbands), homogamy, and hypogamy (wives more educated than their husbands). Results showed that change in husbands’ income with marital duration was similar across couples, whereas change in wives’ income varied by educational assortative mating such that wives in educational hypogamy exhibited more positive change in income over the marital life course.

Using valuable, new data from the 2016 Survey of the Fertility Decision-Making Processes in Chinese Families, we examine the relationship between couple dynamics and women’s fertility autonomy in urban China. If women want no more than one child and already have one, intending to have a second birth indicates low fertility autonomy. Couple dynamics are measured by conjugal power structure and spousal pressure on fertility. We find that only if women have less marital power than their husbands, greater fertility pressure from husband is associated with a higher likelihood that women intend to have a second birth. In addition, when investigating the determinants of couple dynamics, we find that women’s marital power depends on their relative resources, whereas fertility pressure from husband persists regardless. The findings suggest that in post-reform urban China, growing gender inequalities in labor markets likely reduce women’s marital power, which in turn negatively affects their fertility autonomy.

Drawing on theories of the evolution of knowledge and material culture studies, charcoal is seen as embodiment of particular understandings of the agencies of the natural world. Attention to the various stages in the production and use of charcoal sheds light on the structure of this knowledge, especially on the important areas in which qualities of one field of activity are transferred to or become essential to another.

According to the constitution, a Shi’a cleric must fill the office of the leader, the highest de facto and de jure position in the country; a Shi’a jurist should also fill the head of judiciary; and Islam should be the main source of law-making in the country. On the other hand, if calling Iran a theocracy means that the Shi’a clergy as an institution rules the country, then this is not an accurate description. The clerical establishment, even after the revolution, has been separate from the regime, even though the relationship between these two entities has changed drastically after the revolution. While the Shi’a establishment in Qom claims authority over interpretation of the sacred text, the formation of a Shi’a government in Tehran with similar claims about Islamic authority and legitimacy in Tehran has created tensions and sometimes conflicts between these two. In this essay, I will look at patterns of conflict and cooperation between the Islamic Republic mainly the institution of Velayat-e Faqih (guardianship of jurist) and the clerical establishment in Qom, specifically grand ayatollahs[2] or sources of emulation at the highest levels of the Shi’a clerical hierarchy.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:31:05.589791,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-22T18:27:22.227933,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c98|Arts and Humanities|Near Eastern Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cae|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Islamic Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd7|Arts and Humanities|History|Islamic World and Near East History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",No,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/citation/,3d6jq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cvj8z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/relationships/node/,cvj8z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3d3611732ffd000c9322f8/,5a3d3611732ffd000c9322f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d6jq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3d6jq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3d6jq

Modernity individualizes the self and tends to ignore emotions. As a result, conflict can be caused by sequences in which the total hiding of humiliation leads to vengeance. This essay outlines a theory of the social-emotional world implied in the work of C. H. Cooley and others. Cooley’s concept of the “looking-glass self” can be used as antidote to the assumptions of modernity: the basic self is social and emotional: selves are based on “living in the mind” of others, with a result of feeling either pride of shame. Cooley discusses shame at some length, unlike most approaches, which tend to hide it. This essay proposes that the complete hiding of shame can lead to feedback loops (spirals) with no natural limit: shame about shame and anger is only the first step. Emotion backlogs can feed back when emotional experiences are completely hidden: avoiding all pain can lead to limitless spirals. These ideas may help explain the role of France in causing WWI, and Hitler’s rise to power in Germany. To the extent that these propositions are true, the part played by emotions and especially shame in causing wars need to  be further studied.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:31:05.143728,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-22T15:51:45.449221,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/citation/,eu7ha,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gv52m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/relationships/node/,gv52m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3d28ffad359f000ee65bd1/,5a3d28ffad359f000ee65bd1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eu7ha/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eu7ha

Using the age variable in GSS and drawing from Generational Cohort Theory, I isolate the generational cohorts baby boomers and millennials and hypothesize that baby boomers will approve of legal abortion in fewer instances than millennials. Moreover, I create Abortion Attitude Indexes from GSS questions on abortion, which enable me to separate the questions into two groups: hard and soft abortions. Drawing from Attribution Theory, I propose that there will be an overall higher approval of hard abortions than soft abortions across both generational cohorts. Ultimately, bivariate and multivariate analysis reported that age and sex are not statistically significant predictors of abortion attitudes. However, religious fundamentalism is moderately significant. Therefore, one hypothesis is supported that the more religiously fundamentalist an individual is, the fewer instances they are likely to approve of legal abortion.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:31:03.892970,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-22T02:26:02.348812,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/citation/,d6g35,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4b7st/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/relationships/node/,4b7st,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3c57b8732ffd000d928dfe/,5a3c57b8732ffd000d928dfe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d6g35/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d6g35

Our method compares successful and unsuccessful applicants in a lottery used by Pakistan to allocate Hajj visas. Pilgrim accounts stress that the Hajj leads to a feeling of unity with fellow Muslims, but outsiders have sometimes feared that this could be accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. We find that participation in the Hajj increases observance of global Islamic practices, such as prayer and fasting, while decreasing participation in localized practices and beliefs, such as the use of amulets and dowry. It increases belief in equality and harmony among ethnic groups and Islamic sects and leads to more favorable attitudes toward women, including greater acceptance of female education and employment. Increased unity within the Islamic world is not accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. Instead, Hajjis show increased belief in peace, and in equality and harmony among adherents of different religions. The evidence suggests that these changes are likely due to exposure and interaction with Hajjis from around the world, rather than a changed social role of pilgrims upon return.",TRUE,FALSE,beliefs|identity|institutions|religion|social interactions,2018-07-02T11:31:03.241545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-21T23:06:01.860379,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/citation/,a7q5m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5bsp3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/relationships/node/,5bsp3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3c02ff5a93500010a5e1a1/,5a3c02ff5a93500010a5e1a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a7q5m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a7q5m/,https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2009.124.3.1133,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a7q5m
