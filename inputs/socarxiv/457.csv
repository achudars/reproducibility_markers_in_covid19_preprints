The value of CS education is often presented to the public as non-partisan and non-controversial. To uncover the kinds of discourses about CS education that have become “discursive facts,” and how they define and frame notions of “equity” within CS for All initiatives, I apply theories from poststructural, deconstructionist, and critical traditions to the analysis of two different versions of a popular CS education advocacy video created by the non-profit Code.org. Arguments for computer science education offered in these texts merge historical and traditional views of “science” as apolitical and objective with neoliberal notions about competition, personal agency and individualism, constructions that view programming as tools to further an omniscient male gaze, and programmers themselves as “magic.” By reifying neoliberal and gendered subject positions, such discursive moves in CS ed advocacy potentially hinder equity work in the long-run",TRUE,FALSE,Code.org|Computer Science Education|CS4All|CS for All|Discourse analysis|Foucault,2019-04-11T23:41:25.218093,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11T23:40:58.150445,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d65|Education|Other Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|Education|Disability and Equity in Education",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/citation/,rz9gw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cae2299353c58001b975486/,5cae2299353c58001b975486,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rz9gw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rz9gw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rz9gw,NA

Our Bayesian inference study is based on an extensive set of TAP lexical data from the online LexiRumah database (Kaiping &amp; Klamer, 2019). Systematically testing different approaches to cognate coding, loan exclusion, and explicit modelling choices, we arrive at a subgrouping structure of the TAP family that is based on features of the phylogenies shared across the different analyses.

However, the validity of the instrument has been barely assessed. The current study addressed the concurrent and content validity of four popular MAS items (justifiability of homosexuality, suicide, prostitution, and euthanasia). A sample of 493 Russians completed both MAS and the four validated multi-item scales. Results demonstrated that, except for the homosexuality item, the MAS items had low concurrent validity, explaining less than 50% of the variance of the corresponding multi-item scales. The MAS items underestimated the justifiability of homosexuality, prostitution, and suicide, and overestimated the justifiability of euthanasia. The MAS homosexuality item appeared to be a precise measure of attitude towards male (but not female) homosexuality, responses to the prostitution and suicide items overlooked the positive arguments, and the euthanasia item tapped more into attitudes towards euthanasia of a dying person. The four items showed strong dependence on the overall justifiability.

The research was carried out by a comparative analysis of the basic dualistic postulates of Gnosticism, Manichaeism and Bogomilism on the one hand and the available domestic sources of the Bosnian Church on the other. The importance of the work is reflected in the concise and detailed scientific argumentation that undermines ""Bogomil Bosnian Church"" myth, while offering a new scientific thesis on the religious and doctrinological affiliation of the ""Bosnian faith"" and the Bosnian ""krs'tjani"". In the first part, the paper deals with the problem of extreme and moderate dualism, with a special emphasis on the Neognostic, Neomanichaean and Bogomil communities in medieval Balkans. In the second part, the basic premises of Christian mysticism are given, including the possibility of its philosophical and theological compatibility with the teachings of the Bosnian Church, where for the first time the phenomenon of the name ""kr'stjani"" is explained in relation to the mystical union (""unio mystica"").",TRUE,FALSE,apocalypse|bogomilism|Bosnian Church|christian mysticism|dualism|extreme dualism|gnosticism|krstjani|manichaeism|moderate dualism|new testament|ordo de Bulgaria|ordo de Drugonthia|ordo de Sclavonia,2019-04-10T12:05:41.967473,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-10T12:05:21.338300,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|Arts and Humanities|Religion|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d21|Arts and Humanities|Medieval Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/citation/,3v26f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cadb76ae3915600175eb0db/,5cadb76ae3915600175eb0db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3v26f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3v26f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3v26f,NA

Informed by this framework, we estimate the direct effects of class destination and class origin, the effect of own intergenerational class mobility as well as the effects of others’ class position and mobility (so-called reference effects). To do so, we utilize European Social Survey (ESS) waves 1 to 5 (2002-2010). We obtain information on life satisfaction as well as destination and origin class for about 100,000 respondents in 32 European countries. Our mobility analyses are performed with diagonal reference models, which allow for the consistent estimation of mobility effects. We find: (1) Class destination consistently and strongly structures life satisfaction across Europe. (2) Own class mobility positively impacts life satisfaction, particularly in Eastern Europe. (3) Other’s class mobility has a strong negative effect on life satisfaction. Especially the latter finding points to the hitherto neglected importance of reference effects when considering the impact of social class on

Previous research on the connection between high unemployment and media discourse has often relied on case studies of periods when stigmatising rhetoric about the poor was increasing. We build on earlier work on how economic context affects media representations of poverty by creating a unique dataset that measures how often stigmatising descriptions of the poor are used in five centrist and right-wing British newspapers between 1896 and 2000. Our results suggest stigmatising rhetoric about the poor increases when unemployment rises, except at the peak of very deep recessions (e.g. the 1930s and 1980s).

Did these networks evolve in part to connect populations living in differing climate regimes? Here, I examine this relationship with a long-term archaeological case study in the pre-Hispanic North American Southwest, analyzing 7.5 million artifacts from a 250-year period at nearly 500 archaeological sites. I use these artifacts to estimate how the flow of social information changed over time, and to measure how the intensity of social interaction between sites varied as a function of distance and several regional drought patterns. Social interaction decayed with distance, but ties between sites in differing oceanic and continental climate regimes were often stronger than expected. Accounting for these different regional drivers of local climate variability will be crucial for understanding the social impacts of droughts and floods in the past and present.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeological networks|drought patterns|spatial interaction model,2019-04-09T10:52:02.041066,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-09T10:51:47.521918,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/citation/,shp68,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cac27cae3915600175c9bf4/,5cac27cae3915600175c9bf4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/shp68/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/shp68/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/shp68,https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.620856

This creates a barrier to the adoption of purchasing behaviours that would help protect consumers from cybercrime.  One proposal to address this is for IoT devices to carry a security label to help consumers navigate the market. Using a discrete choice experiment, we estimate the potential impact of such labels on participant’s decision making, after controlling for the influence of device functionality and price.  We estimate the impact of three different labelling schemes on consumer choice, and their willingness to pay for devices that carried each of them.  With the exception of a Graded label that implied a device had weak security, participants were significantly more likely to select a device that carried a label than one that did not. Participants were also willing to pay more for devices with premium functionality and those that came with a security label.  While they were generally willing to pay more for premium functionality than security, for two of the labels tested, they were prepared to pay the same amounts. Qualitative responses suggest that participants would use a label to inform purchasing decisions, and that the labels did not generate a false sense of security.  Our findings suggest that the use of a security label represents a policy option that could influence behaviour and that should be seriously considered.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet of Things|Labelling schemes|Willingness to Pay,2019-04-08T22:26:01.492933,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T22:25:43.860727,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Shane D Johnson|John Blythe|Matthew Manning|and Gabriel Wong,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/citation/,4yxp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab84f9641d10001abfc6d8/,5cab84f9641d10001abfc6d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4yxp2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4yxp2,NA

However, it also introduces new potential security threats and risks. These include threats that range from the direct hacking of devices
that could undermine the security, privacy and safety of its users, to the enslaving of IoT devices to commit cybercrime at scale, such as Denial of Service attacks. The IoT is recognised as being widely insecure, in large part, due to the lack of security features built into devices. Additionally, consumers
do not always actively use security features when available. More disconcerting is that we lack market surveillance on whether manufacturers ship products with good security features or how the importance of user-controlled security features is explained to IoT users. Our study seeks to address this gap. To do this, we compiled a database of 270 consumer IoT devices produced by 220 different manufacturers on sale at the time of the study. The user manuals and associated support pages for these devices were then analysed to provide a “consumer eye” view of the security features they provide and the cyber hygiene advice that is communicated to users. The security features identified were then mapped to the UK Government's Secure by Design Code of Practice for IoT devices to examine the extent to which devices currently on the market appear to conform to it. Our findings suggest that manufacturers provide too little publicly-available information about the security features of their devices which makes market surveillance challenging and provides consumers with little information about the security of devices prior to their purchase. On average, there was discussion of around four security features, with account
management and software updates being the most frequently mentioned. Advice to consumers on cyber hygiene was also rarely provided. Finally, we found a lack of standardisation in the communication of security-related information for IoT devices among our sample. We argue for government intervention in this space to provide assurances around device security, whether this provided in a centralised or
decentralised manner.",TRUE,FALSE,Consumer IoT|Internet of Things (IoT)|IoT Security,2019-04-08T22:25:41.941152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T22:25:18.205383,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,John M Blythe|Nissy Sombatruang|Shane D Johnson,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/citation/,63zkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab6b2e08a3bf001b01c60e/,5cab6b2e08a3bf001b01c60e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/63zkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/63zkt,NA
