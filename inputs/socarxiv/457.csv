On the basis of evidence from literature review and an exploratory survey of 8 European countries, we investigate European CE through the lens of Social Innovation (SI). Broadly, three main phases of SI in CE can be identified. The environmental movements of the 1960s and the “oil shocks” of the 1970s provided the catalyst for a series of innovative societal responses around energy and self-sufficiency. These first wave CE innovations included cooperatives (e.g. in Sweden and Germany) who financed and managed risks for RE developments in the absence of support from governments and banks. A second wave of SI relates to the mainstreaming of RE and associated government support mechanisms. In this phase, with some important exceptions, successful CE initiatives were mainly confined to those countries where they were already embedded as innovators in the previous phase. In former communist countries of central and eastern Europe (Poland, former East Germany) CE development was hindered by societal mistrust of cooperative movements for their association with the state socialism of the past. In Scotland, UK, strong public support was given to CE, and a new form, the Community Development Trust, emerged and was later replicated elsewhere in the UK.
The third phase of CE innovation relates to the societal response to the Great Recession that began in 2007-8 and lasted most of the subsequent decade.  Though climate change had become a pressing concern, CE initiatives formed around this time were also strongly focused around democratization of energy and citizen empowerment in the context of rising energy prices, a weak economy, and a production and supply system dominated by excessively powerful multinational energy firms.  CE initiatives today are more diverse than at any time previously, and though seriously constrained by mainstream energy policy in most countries, are likely to continue to act as incubators for pioneering initiatives addressing virtually all aspects of energy.",TRUE,FALSE,community energy|cooperative|crisis|energy democracy|grassroots|participation|renewable energy|social innovation,2018-10-24T18:48:45.176447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-24T18:45:20.273281,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Energy Policy",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/citation/,hswzg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6bhk9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/relationships/node/,6bhk9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd0815c64dabd001d5dce30/,5bd0815c64dabd001d5dce30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hswzg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hswzg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hswzg,NA

Causal Evidence from Great Britain,"Parents with better-educated children are healthier and live longer, but whether there is a causal effect of children’s education on their parents’ health and longevity is still unclear. Previous research has been largely associational and was thus not able to account for all circumstances that confound children’s education and parental longevity. First, we demonstrate an association between adults' offspring education and parental mortality in the 1958 British birth cohort study, which remains substantial - about two additional years of life - even when only comparing parents with similar socio-economic status. Second, we use the 1972 educational reform in England and Wales, which increased the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 years, to identify the presence of a causal effect of children’s education on parental health and longevity using census-linked data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS-LS). Results reveal that children’s education has only very limited causal effects on a wide range of outcomes related to parental mortality and health. We interpret these findings against the backdrop of universal and free health care and the role of education in socio-economic inequality in Great Britain.",TRUE,FALSE,Causes of death|Children's education|Education|Educational reform|Health|Long-standing illness|Mortality|ONS Longitudinal Study|Parental health|Parental mortality|Parent-child relations|Regression discontinuity|Self-rated health,2018-10-24T18:49:01.804775,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-24T18:45:54.133239,NA,NA,available,See description in manuscript for details,http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5TQYA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",The authors,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/citation/,eah4w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5tqya/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/relationships/node/,5tqya,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bd04c6192cf0c001ac2d9c3/,5bd04c6192cf0c001ac2d9c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eah4w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eah4w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eah4w,NA

To add resolution to this emerging insight, this study examines how \neighborhood environments, an especially salient level of geographic organization, impact educational gradients in the US. Using data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Study (n = 3,105) and Bayesian multilevel regression models, I examine how educational disparities in self-rated health and depressive symptomatology, between college and non-college degree holders, grow/shrink in response to a neighborhood-provided resource and with exposure to a neighborhood-level health challenge.

their existence over time (e.g., Mount &amp; Garcia Martinez, 2014; Nonaka &amp; von Krogh, 2009;
Von Krogh, 2012). Recently, organizations typically strive to create new knowledge by setting
up social media platforms (Razmerita, Kirchner, &amp; Nabeth, 2014). Hence, there is growing
scholarly interest in the role of social media, i.e. digital technologies of the Web 2.0 generation
(Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2017) in collaborative knowledge endeavors (Hemsley &amp; Mason, 2013;
Kallinikos &amp; Tempini, 2014; Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2016; Neeley &amp; Leonardi, 2018; Voigt &amp;
Ernst, 2010; Wagner, Vollmar, &amp; Wagner, 2014).
Yet, the majority of social media studies focuses on knowledge sharing (e.g., Majchrzak, Faraj,
Kane, &amp; Azad, 2013; for recent overviews, see Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2016; Panahi, Watson, &amp;
Partridge, 2013). In particular, scholars highlight that social media facilitate knowledge sharing
behavior in organizations in a unique manner due to their unique affordances, i.e., the
“perceptions of an objects’ utility” (Treem &amp; Leonardi, 2012, p. 145), which cover visibility,
editability, persistence, and association for the ‘object’ social media (Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2015;
Treem &amp; Leonardi, 2012). These scholars further speculate that the affordances of social media
might also contribute to knowledge creation (Leonardi &amp; Vaast, 2017).",TRUE,FALSE,knowledge creation|social media,2018-10-23T13:28:21.211293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-23T13:18:16.025848,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/citation/,w7sd6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pm9sn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/relationships/node/,pm9sn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bcedebfab09bf001a9d2fde/,5bcedebfab09bf001a9d2fde,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7sd6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w7sd6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w7sd6,NA

The occurrence of natural and anthropogenic risk phenomena, known as hazards, puts a heavy tribute on disaster-sensitive human communities regardless of their level of development. The magnitude of the disasters and their increasing frequency and severity imply the need for their approach by the entire world community and for global action.

By highlighting the existing patterns of  interactions, distributed leadership (DL) is not only eminent in its simplest form, but collegiality and autonomy can readily be realized. New knowledge, based on the tweets and collegial online interactions from the 14,183 tweets sent by the HEIs in the US, UK, Canada, and South Korea, not only promotes the HEIs' unique online persona, but captures the very essence of leadership under investigation. Distinct leadership styles are separated into any one of the twenty-one administrative activities, which I constructed. Further, the learning opportunities and outcomes, associated with either managerial and non-managerial functions, culminate as the distinguishing features of online leadership. Contextual analysis has been applied to navigate the open conversations and the interactions taking place to categorize and measure the impact of the leadership in the ongoing practice of DL as a demonstrative theory. Long-term instruction in all its administrative roles is favored as the means for providing a new form of education—tweet by tweet. How the learning objectives are being advanced in the tweets themselves governs not only the resulting leadership style, but predicts the learning process in HE.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-10-22T14:22:05.495551,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-22T13:44:52.469762,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e10|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Public Relations and Advertising|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e17|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|International and Intercultural Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/citation/,38jcq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5mysf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/relationships/node/,5mysf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bcd3485a334dd0019f1e7bc/,5bcd3485a334dd0019f1e7bc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/38jcq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/38jcq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/38jcq,NA
