For each advertised price, the number of standard drinks per purchase, the price per standard drink, and the frequency of prices that would increase under a MUP policy similar to Scotland’s was determined.  There was an inverse correlation between the number of standard drinks per purchase and the advertised price per standard drink for beer/malt beverages (r = -0.76, p &lt; 0.001) and wine (r = -0.42, p &lt; 0.001), which would be eliminated under MUP.

Further, it explores cross-national variations in the gap between professionals and non-professionals with respect to both outcome variables. Professional service sector employees were consistently found to experience higher levels of WHI and lower levels of SWFB. The use of organizational work–family resources differed across welfare state regimes and levels of national gender equality. It was highest in Sweden and The Netherlands and lowest in Portugal. A family-supportive supervisor and a family-supportive organizational culture differentially affected WHI of professional and non-professional workers, with a family-supportive supervisor being more beneficial to non-professionals and a family-supportive organizational culture being more beneficial to professional employees. Finally, the gap between professionals and non-professionals was also found to vary across countries for WHI but not for SWFB.

Prices of 25 and 50 dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions cause electricity emissions reductions of 17% and 22% from present levels, respectively. This suggests significant electricity sector emissions reductions can be achieved quickly from a modest carbon tax. Short run effects refer to operational changes at existing U.S. power plants, mostly by switching production from coal plants to natural gas plants. The results do not include long run emissions reductions related to 1) new investments and retirements of electricity production assets, and 2) demand response as regulated electricity suppliers pass cost changes to retail customers. A state-level analysis of the results leads to the following conclusions: 1) most emissions reductions come from high coal-consuming states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, 2) fifteen states increase emissions because their natural gas consumption offsets coal consumption in neighboring states, and 3) a flat per-capita rebate of tax revenue leads to wealth transfers across states.",TRUE,FALSE,Carbon tax|Climate change|Electricity markets|Energy economics|Energy policy,2019-05-01T11:40:21.395393,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-01T11:40:10.857017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/citation/,b79yu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/59pf6/,59pf6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc8b66e00a81000175d8b54/,5cc8b66e00a81000175d8b54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b79yu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b79yu,https://doi.org/10.3390/en12112150

The steward is an individual who practices in a field in a manner that invites and warrants the trust of the public, other practitioners, and employers to uphold and maintain the integrity of that field. It is important to your sense of professional identity - and also your profession - to cultivate a sense of stewardship; and one of the foundational aspects of stewardly behavior is to understand professional practice guidelines and the types of behaviors that are expected by practitioners in a given field. Therefore, this article presents two sets of guidelines that can support professionalism, ethical practice, and the development of a coherent professional identity for the statistician and data scientist. The American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) are large professional organizations with international membership. An overall objective of each of these organizations is to promote excellence in and by their members and all those who practice in their respective – sometimes shared/joint – domains. It can be helpful to consider the field of ‘statistics and data science’ to be a hybrid of, or co-dependent on, these two fields, which is one reason why the two organizations are presented together. Another reason is that both organizations take ethical practice very seriously, and both engaged in lengthy projects to carefully revise their respective ethical guidelines for professional practice in 2018.  Not only does engagement with the guidelines support you initiating, and beginning to demonstrate, your commitment to this particular professional identity, but also exploring the ethical guidelines for professional practice (through ASA or ACM) is a first step towards documenting your commitment to stewardly work as a data scientist. Ethical reasoning, the third focus of this article, helps deepen the understanding of the guidelines and can be useful to generate evidence of stewardly development.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-01T11:40:02.631250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-01T11:39:42.488588,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/citation/,93wuk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc8aa4b42c4b70017b810b6/,5cc8aa4b42c4b70017b810b6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93wuk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93wuk,NA

this massage reach to the ends of the earth for the evangelization of all, both the Jews and Gentiles,
he selected twelve apostles out of the disciples that followed him. These twelve he molded and
made the ""light"" of the world and ""salt"" of the earth and urged them to let their light shine so that
people will see their light and glorify their father who is in heaven (Matt. 5:13-16). It is this
twelve that followed him from the inception of his ministry to the end of his ministry. The
implication is that they were with him from his baptism to his ascension. Having formed the
Twelve, he sent them on a mission to evangelize the whole world. The aim of this article is to
restate anew the inseparability of formation and mission in the work of evangelization and their
indispensability in the work of evangelization. This paper argues that if the mandate of Jesus in
Matt. 28:16-20 is duly understood and imbibed then formation, and re-formation of evangelizers
cannot be over emphasized. Significantly, the outcome of this research will be of immense benefit

one looks around today one discovers that Africa has become the dumping ground of used
products from Europe and America and to save life, one must travel to get adequate medical
attention. Hospitals, schools, road networks, modern mass communication equipments, job
opportunities, scholarship schemes, electricity are majorly in shambles or epileptic. When one
visits some institutions of higher learning as well as hospitals outside the shores of Africa, one
discovers that experts in various fields working in them are from Africa. One of the things
migration of the young from Africa to Europe and America has taught us is that African children
can compete favourably with their European and American counterparts when placed under the
same condition. Hence, it is not that Africans are not gifted intellectually, they are but African's
intellectual prowess has not been adequately harnessed as a result of the actions and inactions of
their leaders. This proves that there is nothing wrong with African soil, water, air and vegetation.
The problem is actually perpetuated daily by old, selfish, visionless and uncharismatic leaders in
Africa. When such leaders are on seat, the destinies of their citizens are daily suppressed
knowingly or unknowingly. This study aims at showing that African underdevelopment lies in the
hands of selfish and sit-tight leaders. Jesus in the above chapter and verses of Matthew urges that
anyone who will present himself to be a leader must be the servant of others. The desire of a
servant leader centers on how to help all citizens realize their destinies. This study adopted the
historical critical exegesis as well as library research as her methodology to arrive at her
conclusions. This study argues that if present crop of leaders in Africa were to be selfless and
charismatic, Africa will be the envy of the whole world. Significantly, this study will be of
immense benefit to Africans and indeed the whole world.",TRUE,FALSE,Destiny|Leader|Selfish,2019-05-03T15:10:21.823408,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03T15:07:41.531963,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76caf|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Biblical Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/citation/,zsf2a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc805d342c4b70016b48029/,5cc805d342c4b70016b48029,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zsf2a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zsf2a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zsf2a,NA

Compromise of any electoral criteria (law) gives room for outright rejection of results which may eventually leads to anarchy if not properly managed by the court of the said land. Election of Matthias in Acts 1:12-26 shows oneness of purpose, and willingness to follow a laid down criteria for anyone who would replace the impaired disciple. The criteria suggested two qualified candidates. Eventually, Matthias was unanimously elected and admirably accepted. The aim of this paper is to show that the majority of the electoral outcome that are rejected and contested in court are those the criteria that led to them were highly compromised. The paper argues that if Nigerians were to respect her electoral laws in every election then there will be little or no suit challenging the outcome of such elections in court. Significantly, the outcome of this work will benefit all Nigerians and indeed all nations of the world.

This paper is an exploratory review which focuses on the topic of student motivation and engagement in classroom learning environments focusing on mathematics and the instructional method of inquiry-based learning (IBL). IBL has shown to impact student motivation and engagement, but the outcomes of this impact are still unclear. Thus, IBL is explored as a potential method to impact motivation and engagement in children. Expectancy-value theory (EVT) is used to examine the aforementioned relationship using symbolic interactionist and structural-functionalist theories for classroom interactions and math self-concept respectively. Finally, conclusions are made about relationships between IBL and motivation and engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,Inquiry based learning,2019-05-01T11:38:21.311996,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-01T11:38:10.121640,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Rajneet Kaur,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/citation/,9n5tv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc789f7bbbd370019a1ac77/,5cc789f7bbbd370019a1ac77,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9n5tv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9n5tv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9n5tv,NA
