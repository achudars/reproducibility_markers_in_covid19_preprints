The answer of quantum mechanics,"Many researchers determine the question “Why anything rather than nothing?” as the most ancient and fundamental philosophical problem. Furthermore, it is very close to the idea of Creation shared by religion, science, and philosophy, e.g. as the “Big Bang”, the doctrine of “first cause” or “causa sui”, the Creation in six days in the Bible, etc.
Thus, the solution of quantum mechanics, being scientific in fact, can be interpreted also philosophically, and even religiously. However, only the philosophical interpretation is the topic of the text.
The essence of the answer of quantum mechanics is:
1. The creation is necessary in a rigorous mathematical sense. Thus, it does not need any choice, free will, subject, God, etc. to appear. The world exists in virtue of mathematical necessity, e.g. as any mathematical truth such as 2+2=4.
2. The being is less than nothing rather than more than nothing. So, the creation is not an increase of nothing, but the decrease of nothing: it is a deficiency in relation of nothing. Time and its “arrow” are the way of that diminishing or incompleteness to nothing.",TRUE,FALSE,|Creation|dark energy|dark matter|entanglement|quantum information|the “Big Bang”|the Standard model,2020-05-26T17:47:46.612127,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-26T17:47:32.431775,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf6|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Metaphysics|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/citation/,t46ry,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecb82c9c7568601752d32a8/,5ecb82c9c7568601752d32a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t46ry/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t46ry/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t46ry,NA

determinants of migration such as poverty, food insecurity and climate change are giving
way to new motivations. These new issues, that include but are not limited to ambitions
to live a foreign lifestyle, incomplete and asymmetric information are capable of
underestimating the risk in irregular migration. As the information about foreign lifestyle
flow freely and new opportunities open, it becomes very difficult to manage irregular
migration through border control. Within the transitional mode of international
migration, the use of awareness campaigns, especially in rural areas of home countries
that target the most vulnerable groups, – school-age youths, could become a veritable
means of deterring irregular migration.
In 2018, Ricosmigration – Rural Information Campaign on Safe Migration - received
funding from the German Foreign Office to investigate why young people from Nigeria
migrate irregularly and implement a safe migration awareness campaign for youth in
rural secondary schools. This report is from the result of the project which cut across
interviews of Nigerian migrants living in Italy, potential migrants in Nigeria, and the result
of the awareness campaigns conducted in 10 secondary schools in Edo, Nigeria. In the
report, we explain the profile of a potential migrant from Nigeria. We also explore how
reduced capabilities to lead the desired life and how the increasing use of social media
internet has greatly raised the likelihood of migration in Nigeria. We equally show in the
detail how we implemented a randomized experiment to test the efficiency of the
migration awareness campaign.
The project provides a new dimension to the discourse of the root cause of migration by
introducing the role of limited opportunities and freedom (capabilities), low life
satisfaction, and incomplete information through social media. Additionally, it shows the
power of light interventions such as awareness campaigns in reducing irregular
migration. In particular, the result showed that about 77.2 per cent of Nigerian youths
that responded to the interview have the intention to migrate abroad, and 37.2 per cent
would migrate if they win a cash lottery that is enough to cover the migration cost. Our
randomized experiment showed that migration awareness campaign could reduce the
risk of being a victim of human trafficking by more than 50 per cent. It could also reduce
the desire to engage in irregular migration by more than 30 per cent and increased the
decision to take necessary steps to avoid human traffickers and follow proper procedures
for safe migration by more than 50 per cent.
The awareness campaign had a wide coverage reaching about 7000 students in rural
communities in Edo State, Nigeria. The success factors of our awareness campaign include
the utilization of appropriate channels, delivery of an accurate message that was tailored
to the group we spoke to, and the use of respected external facilitators.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-05-26T17:49:02.689663,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-26T17:48:43.780869,TRUE,This Project is Supported by the German foreign office,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/citation/,v3kn2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecb786017ac9e017f6227b2/,5ecb786017ac9e017f6227b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v3kn2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v3kn2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v3kn2,NA

Policy choices may distribute election resources unequally, skewing voting outcomes. In low- and middle-income countries where electoral capacity and resources are scarce and decision-making highly centralized, election administration has the potential to shape results on a large scale. In the context of Kenya's August 2017 elections, I study the consequences of a legislated threshold that determines the capacity of polling centers to quickly serve voters by reducing election-day lines. Using a regression discontinuity design I find that turnout is 2.4% lower in congested polling places just below the threshold relative to polling places above the threshold. Relative to other hypothetical thresholds, the chosen threshold benefits the incumbent president, as incumbent strongholds receive more polling resources than opposition areas.

In this study, we analyzed averaged suicide rates and annual mean temperature in the early 21st century for 183 countries worldwide, and our results suggest that suicide rates vary with climatic temperature. The lowest suicide rates were found for countries with annual mean temperatures of approximately 20 °C. The correlation suicide rate and temperature is much stronger at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. In the countries with higher temperature, high suicide rates appear with its temperature over about 25 °C. We also investigated the variation in suicide rates with climate based on the Köppen–Geiger climate classification, and found suicide rates to be low in countries in dry zones regardless of annual mean temperature. Moreover, there were distinct trends in the suicide rates in island countries. Considering these complicating factors, a clear relationship between suicide rates and temperature is evident, for both hot and cold climate zones, in our dataset. Finally, low suicide rates are typically found in countries with annual mean temperatures within the established human thermal comfort range.

These findings challenge widely held beliefs that perceptions of the economy are solely driven by economic factors such as family income and employment status. My theoretical approach examines how whiteness and colorblindness shape and distort white consumers’ perception of the economy. I develop the framework of white imagined futures. White imagined futures assume a white-owned and white-dominated destiny of wealth and economic success based on an economy that is built to serve white people above all other racial groups. I utilize the American National Election Study due to its measures of racial colorblindness and perception of the economy. I pooled a subsample of the American National Election Study from 2000 to 2016 and conducted an OLS regression and regression-based causal mediation analysis to test how racial and economic ideologies influence perceptions of the economy. The study finds that racial colorblindness serves to stratify present perceptions of the economy and notes how racial colorblindness ideology is also being conveyed through market fundamentalism ideologies. The study also demonstrates that whites’ racial ideology has a role in shaping their perceptions of the economy. This evidence supports claims that white supremacy ideology, as defined here, is embedded within markets. Moreover, this study provides evidence that challenges the notions that economic perceptions are solely tied to a person’s economic reality (e.g. income, employment status).

Through marketisation, internationalisation and digitisation, the business model of exchanges has fundamentally changed and led to the emergence of global exchange groups that dominate the exchange industry. Thereby, exchanges transformed from national marketplaces to global providers of financial infrastructures. They control the infrastructures that enable the functioning of capital markets: from market data, indices, financial products, trading platforms to post-trading activities such as clearing, exchanges create the rules according to which market transactions take place. This provision of financial infrastructures enables them to shape capital markets and represents a source of structural power, as exchanges potentially influence the actions of companies, investors and states entangled with these infrastructures.

In this study, the impact of different genres of background music on consumer spending was examined via a pilot field test conducted in three branches each of both a Japanese-themed and a Mexican-themed restaurant chain in Singapore. Three music genre conditions (‘pop’, ‘traditional’, ‘mix’), corresponding to the restaurants’ cultural theme, were played for a week in each restaurant. Data on total spending and spending per customer were collected and analysed. While direct music genre effects were not statistically significant, results indicated certain trends where higher consumer expenditure was observed in conditions utilizing a mixture of pop and traditional music (‘mix’). Specifically, spending per customer for the ‘mix’ condition was 11.4% higher than for ‘pop’ for the Japanese restaurant, whereas it was 6.3% higher for the ‘mix’ condition than for “traditional” for the Mexican restaurant. The results also further suggest that music could be tailored to different days of the week to appeal to different customer profiles and lend additional support for the leveraging of suitable music parameters to induce consumption behaviours.",TRUE,FALSE,background music|Japanese|Mexican|restaurant|sales,2020-05-24T20:34:40.734120,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-24T20:34:24.626989,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dac|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Other Psychology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/citation/,7a45h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eca32faaeeb6d01090860a2/,5eca32faaeeb6d01090860a2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7a45h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7a45h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7a45h,NA

Self-reported civility was correlated with age (r (214) = .134, p = .049), and experientiality (r (210) = .255, p &lt; .001), but inversely correlated with social anxiety (r (210) = -.172, p = .013). There were no gender effects for civility (p = .014, r = .11), self-consciousness dimensions, and experientiality, even though males scored significantly higher on rationality (p = .013, r = .17). No effects were found for indicators of SES on civility scores.

In the study, a simulated client called and described a list of symptoms experienced by her brother, and asked the pharmacist for a recommendation. In our ""common"" condition, the symptoms were headache, sore throat, and fever. In our COVID condition, we added anosmia (i.e., the loss of smell) as a fourth symptom, allowing better discrimination with respect to other diseases. We find that mentioning anosmia induced a more cautious behavior among pharmacists. The probability that pharmacists recommend to register the case in the dedicated emergency line increased from 19.7 to 32.2 percent, whereas the probability that pharmacists make a prescription decreased from 69.7 to 51.5 percent. The seven selected municipalities were drawn from dengue endemic and non-endemic areas. Although we hypothesized that past experience with symptoms from the common condition would make harder to provide adequate recommendations in endemic areas, we did not find differences in behavior supporting this hypothesis.",TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|diagnosis|information|Latin America|simulated clients|standardized patients,2020-05-24T20:27:42.139914,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-24T20:27:19.840427,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/citation/,s2z47,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec94bf8c75686010a2d1c6e/,5ec94bf8c75686010a2d1c6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2z47/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s2z47/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s2z47,NA
