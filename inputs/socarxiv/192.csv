There is little momentum to pursue a political settlement, with Al-Shabaab rejecting any overtures of dialogue. Drawing on theoretical perspectives from peace and conflict literature and key interviews with clan elders and Al-Shabaab defectors, this article explores two interconnected themes. First, Al-Shabaab’s dynamic attitudes towards dialogue since the group’s establishment; and second, how clan elders play diverse peace-seeking roles, negotiating between Al-Shabaab and FGS at the microlevel. The article highlights two important findings. First, Al-Shabaab was initially inclined toward dialogue but, following the death and defection of senior members, increasingly adopted an anti-negotiation stance. Second, whilst Al-Shabaab is obstinately refusing any dialogue on the macrolevel, at the microlevel, the group indirectly negotiates with the FGS and other actors using clan elders as interlocutors and facilitators. Finally, the article explores the idea that, instead of relying on foreign third-party mediators to resolve Somalia’s protracted stalemate at the macrolevel, clan elders, as credible insider-partial mediators possessing locally sourced legitimacy and perceived integrity, have the capacity to help overcome the stalemate between Al-Shabaab and the FGS.",TRUE,FALSE,Al-Shabaab|clan elders|insider-partial mediators|ripeness|Somalia,2020-09-09T18:14:44.782858,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-09T18:13:04.152174,FALSE,NA,no,,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/citation/,5cp6k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f57d3129fdada01e19ee4d9/,5f57d3129fdada01e19ee4d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5cp6k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5cp6k/,https://doi.org/10.1080/17531055.2020.1863099,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5cp6k

Drawing on the framework of intersectionality, we expect that boys growing up with less educated mothers and in single-parent families may lag more strongly behind girls in reading and behavior problems. In math, they may be less ahead than their peers from more advantaged backgrounds. Our findings provide evidence for the expected heterogeneity of gender differences by maternal education but not by family structure. This may suggest that cultural norms connected to education are more important than family resources and the presence of (male) role models in explaining the observed heterogeneity across family circumstances.

While essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a guilt-free strategy that was used by Daoust et al.

Our findings show that the guilt-free strategy is a very useful tool in every country included, increasing respondents’ proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points.

Unfortunately, previous research suggests that many Americans plan to refuse a vaccine; thereby jeopardizing collective immunity. We investigate the effectiveness of three different health communication frames hypothesized to increase vaccine intention; emphasizing either (1) personal health risks, (2) economic costs, or (3) collective public health consequences of not vaccinating.

Methods:  In a large (N = 7,064) and demographically representative survey experiment, we randomly assigned respondents to read pro-vaccine communication materials featuring one of the frames listed above. We also randomly varied the message source (ordinary people vs. medical experts) and availability of information designed the “pre-bunk” concerns about expedited clinical trial safety.

Findings: We find that messages emphasizing the personal health risks and collective health consequences of not vaccinating significantly increase Americans’ intentions to vaccinate. These effects are similar in magnitude irrespective of message source, and the inclusion of pre-bunking information. Surprisingly, economic cost frames have no discernible effect on vaccine intention.

Many measures have been adopted, including contact tracing and risk assessment, whereby citizen whereabouts are constantly monitored to trace contact with other infectious individuals and isolate contagious parties via algorithmic evaluation of their risk status. This paper investigates how citizens make sense of Health Code (jiankangma), the contact tracing and risk assessment algorithm in China. We probe how people accept or resist the algorithm by examining their ongoing, dynamic, and relational interactions with it over time. By seeking a deeper, iterative understanding of how individuals accept or resist the algorithm, our data unearths three key sites of concern. First, how understandings of algorithmic surveillance shape and are shaped by notions of privacy, including fatalism towards the possibility of true privacy in China and a trade-off narrative between privacy and twin imperatives of public and economic health. Second, how trust in the algorithm is mediated by the perceived competency of the technology, the veracity of input data, and well-publicized failures in both data collection and analysis. Third, how the implementation of Health Code in social life alters beliefs about the algorithm, such as its further role after COVID-19 passes, or contradictory and disorganized enforcement measures upon risk assessment.

Participants display a rich variety of attitudes toward privacy and surveillance, ranging from fatalism to the possibility of privacy to trade-offs for surveillance in exchange for public health, which is mediated by the perceived effectiveness of Health Code and changing views on the intentions of institutions who deploy it. We show how perceived competency varies not just on how well the technology works, but on the social and cultural enforcement of various non-technical aspects like quarantine, citizen data inputs, and cell reception. Furthermore, we illustrate how perceptions of Health Code are nested in people’s broader interpretations of disease control at the national and global level, and unexpectedly strengthen the Chinese authority’s legitimacy.

Science and environmental communication is needed to inform these debates. However, not all parts of society are equally reached by traditional science communication. In particular young people, especially without academic background, are often left out. The cooperation of science communicators with influencers on the video platform YouTube can be a way to convey scientific information and raise awareness for environmental issues with new young audiences. This case study looks at three videos from the campaign #EarthOvershootDay on YouTube by the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) Germany and the educational initiative MESH Collective. The focus of the analysis lies on the established success factors of communication through influencers—specifically authenticity, comprehensibility and storytelling—and how they play out in detail in the three exemplary videos. Besides the analysis of the videos, the study is corroborated by interviews with the producers and a comment analysis in order to include the perspective of the viewers. Our analysis confirms previous findings on science communication with influencers and illustrates the practical implementation of these findings. It shows that authenticity is a central aspect which is not disturbed through the presentation of scientific content. The storytelling approaches are tailored to the respective influencer and their style. The language and structure of the videos are simple and comprehensible, scientific arguments focus on selected aspects and are tied to examples from everyday life. The comments by the users support these findings with the majority of comments addressing the three aspects of our analysis being positive. However, evidence for an in-depth engagement with the scientific contents could not be found in the comments.

We examine two prominent presentational strategies: scapegoating and spinning, while testing how public responses vary depending on whether they are ideologically aligned with the public official. We examine these relationships in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the Trump administration sought to shift blame by scapegoating outgroups (by using the term “Chinese virus”), and framing performance information on COVID-19 testing in positive terms. Using a novel pre-registered survey experiment that incorporates open and close-ended items, we offer three main findings. First, there is clear evidence of motivated reasoning: conservatives rate the performance of the Trump administration more positively and are more apt to blame prominent Democrats, Chinese residents and the Chinese Government. Second, performance information framing was found to impact blame attribution among conservatives, but only for open-ended responses. Third, while exposure to the term “Chinese virus” increased blame assigned to Chinese residents among all participants, conservatives exposed to the term appeared to blame President Trump more, suggesting repeated use of divisive blame shifting strategies may alienate even supporters.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-09-08T08:07:43.857295,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-08T08:07:32.102758,FALSE,NA,no,Paper is under peer review and will be made public after.

Melalui kajian literatur yang diperoleh dari berbagai sumber baik cetak maupun elektronik, penulis memaparkan urgensi pembelajaran antargenerasi untuk mengembangkan modal dan kohesi sosial, membangun generasi bersama dan menjembatani kesenjangan antargenerasi. Untuk mendapatkan karakteristik yang jelas dari teori dan konsep yang dikaji, penulis menggunakan metode content analysis. Hasil dan pembahasan dititikberatkan pada upaya menggeneralisasi konsep generasi dan pengelompokannya, kesenjangan yang timbul akibat perbedaan generasi serta program yang diberi atribut sebagai pembelajaran antargenerasi. Pada bagian akhir tulisan, penulis memaparkan implikasi pembelajaran antargenerasi dalam tataran praktik.

In contrast, comparative judgement studies suggest that it is possible to assess open ended tasks such as writing with greater reliability. Many previous studies, however, have failed to provide direct comparisons between these approaches as the reliability measures for rubric- and marking-based studies are not comparable with the internal measures of reliability cited by comparative judgement studies. We investigated the classification accuracy and consistency of a rubric-based approach to the grading of writing with a comparative judgement approach. The writing was gathered from 11-year-olds in low stakes settings in England. We present evidence that the comparative judgement approach has twice the classification accuracy as the rubric-based approach and is perfectly viable in terms of its efficiency. We discuss the limitations of the comparisons and consider what a national system for assessing writing based on a comparative judgement approach could look like.",TRUE,FALSE,assessment|classification accuracy|comparative judgement|reliability|rubric|writing,2020-09-07T13:40:22.555956,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-07T13:40:00.710681,FALSE,NA,no,We are looking to see how we can make the data publicly available.,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",No More Marking Ltd,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/citation/,vzus4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f56342cdf5dbc011a13ee4e/,5f56342cdf5dbc011a13ee4e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzus4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vzus4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vzus4
